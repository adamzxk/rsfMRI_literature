Title: Cortical metabolic characteristics of anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibody encephalitis based on (18)F-FDG PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: A general glucose metabolism pattern is observed in patients with anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody encephalitis; however, it is unclear whether further subregional metabolic differences exist. Therefore, the present study aimed to conduct an in-depth exploration of the features of glucose metabolism within specific brain areas using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled thirteen patients confirmed with LGI1 antibody encephalitis who were admitted to Beijing Tiantan Hospital from June 2021 to September 2022. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET before initiating clinical treatment. Changes in glucose metabolism in specific brain areas were analyzed using Cortex ID software. The laterality of (18)F-FDG uptake was assessed, and differences in specific brain areas were compared using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Significant metabolic changes in at least one brain region in 11 out of 13 patients (84.6%) were revealed by semi-quantitative analysis (z-score > 2). A bilateral decrease in the (18)F-FDG metabolic pattern was revealed in almost all brain regions of interest; in contrast, a hypermetabolic pattern was observed in the medial temporal region, with mean z-scores of 1.75 +/- 3.27 and 2.36 +/- 5.90 on the left and right sides, respectively (p = 0.497). In the prefrontal and temporal lobes, (18)F-FDG metabolism was significantly lower in the lateral region than in the medial region on both sides. For the cingulate cortex, significant hypometabolism was also observed in the posterior part compared to the anterior counterpart on both the left (z-score: -1.20 +/- 1.93 vs. -0.42 +/- 1.18, respectively; p = 0.047) and right (z-score: -1.56 +/- 1.96 vs. -0.33 +/- 1.63, respectively; p = 0.001) sides. However, a significant difference in regional metabolism was observed only on the left side (p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: An asymmetric (18)F-FDG metabolic pattern exists in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Meanwhile, varied regional metabolic differences were revealed bilaterally in specific cerebral areas, which could be associated with the clinical manifestations.

Title: FDG-PET in Autoimmune Encephalitis: Utility, Pattern of Abnormalities, and Correlation with Autoantibodies.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in autoimmune encephalitis (AE) as an adjunctive investigation helps in characterizing the type of AE based on characteristic metabolic patterns. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the following: (i) the sensitivity of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of AE, (ii) describe abnormal patterns of metabolism of various subtypes of AE, and (iii) correlate serum serology with FDG-PET abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at a tertiary university hospital in South India. The demographic profile, clinical features, and investigations (FDG-PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) were reviewed. The nuclear medicine physician performed blinded qualitative visual and semi-quantitative analysis of the 18-FDG-PET (fluorine 18-FDG-PET) findings of these patients. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (M:F: 11:18) patients were recruited; among them, 22 (75.8%) patients had autoimmune antibodies; the rest seven (24.1%) patients were seronegative. Among the 22 seropositive patients, 9 (31%) patients were positive for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), 8 (28%) for anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI-1), 4 (14%) for anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), 1 (3%) for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65, and rest 7 (24%) patients were seronegative. The patterns most commonly observed were isolated hypermetabolism (41%), isolated hypometabolism (41%), and combined hypermetabolism with hypometabolism (18%). The fraction of abnormalities was lower for MRI (17/22; 73.9%) than for FDG-PET (27/29; 93.1%). FDG-PET correlated with serology in 10 (34%) cases [NMDAR: 6 (60%) and LGI-1: 4 (40%)]. The sensitivity of FDG-PET was 94.1% when compared with MRI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: FDG-PET correlated with serology in only one-third of patients. The most consistent pattern in both seropositive and seronegative AE is characterized by parieto-occipital hypometabolism and fronto-temporal with basal ganglia hypermetabolism.

Title: Morvan's Syndrome: The Importance of Knowing Different Risk-Associated Phenotypes and Antibodies in Identifying the Correct Underlying Tumor.
Abstract: Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are neurologic disorders that can affect any part of the nervous system, occur in association with cancer, and have an immune-mediated mechanism that produces direct damage to the neural tissue. Neurological symptoms frequently precede, in months to years, the symptoms directly attributed to the primary tumor, requiring a high clinical suspicion for adequate investigation. We report the case of a man in his early 80s admitted for an altered level of consciousness, alternating between periods with stupor and drowsiness, short-term waking states and psychomotor agitation, respiratory failure and dysautonomia, resembling a Morvan's syndrome. Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 and anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 antibodies were both positive and, after exclusion of infectious and autoimmune systemic causes, the possibility of PNS was raised. Screening for the primary tumor was pursued, and an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)/PET showed only an intensely hypermetabolic, apparent parietal thickening of the lower rectum. Due to the frequent association of Morvan's syndrome to thymoma, a review of the CT of the thorax images was requested and a mediastinal image with features of thymoma was identified. PNS treatment and prognosis depend on finding and treating the underlying tumor, with benefits in both resolution of neurological symptoms and in the prognosis of the underlying tumor itself. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this frequent but underdiagnosed and underreported condition, in order to improve the chances of better outcomes.

Title: What is the Best Preoperative Quantitative Indicator to Differentiate Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma from Glioblastoma?
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of surgery in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is to allow pathological diagnosis from tumor biopsy. However, PCNSL is often difficult to distinguish from other tumors, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Quantitative evaluations to facilitate differentiation between PCNSL and GBM would be useful. Here, we investigated the best examinations for exact differentiation of PCNSL from GBM among preoperative examinations, including imaging studies and tumor markers. METHODS: Various examinations were performed for 68 patients with PCNSL , including serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor, beta2-microglobulin (MG) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), diffusion-weighted imaging, (11)C-methionine-positron emission tomography (PET), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. These results were compared with findings from 28 patients with consecutive GBM who underwent the same examinations to evaluate the utility and accuracy of different investigations. RESULTS: CSF beta2-MG >/=2.0 mg/L was relatively specific for PCNSL, offering 95.0% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue ratio >/=2.4 on (18)F-FDG-PET was also quite specific for PCNSL, offering 83.8% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity. No other examinations displayed any significant differences in quantitative differential markers between PCNSL and GBM. CONCLUSIONS: Both beta2-MG >/=2.0 mg/dL in CSF and tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue ratio >/=2.4 from (18)F-FDG-PET allow quantitative differentiation of PCNSL from GBM, potentially representing clinically useful indicators. These findings could lead to innovative methods for differentiating PCNSL from GBM as well as new treatment strategies for other brain tumors.

Title: High grade glioma recurrence presenting as extensive tumor thrombus and simultaneous pulmonary metastasis revealed on (18)F-FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: Extensive tumor thrombus and simultaneous pulmonary metastasis in glioma patient is rare. Herein, we reported a 45-year-old woman with extensive tumor thrombus in sagittal sinus and sigmoid sinus with obvious enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed extensive tumor thrombus in sagittal sinus, sigmoid sinus andinternal jugular vein, and simultaneous left hilar lymph node andpulmonary metastasis. Our case demonstrated the value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for correctly identifying tumor thrombus,detecting extent of tumor thrombus and distant metastasis in high grade glioma patients.

Title: Glucose Infusion Induced Change in Intracellular pH and Its Relationship with Tumor Glycolysis in a C6 Rat Model of Glioblastoma.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The reliance on glycolytic metabolism is a hallmark of tumor metabolism. Excess acid and protons are produced, leading to an acidic tumor environment. Therefore, we explored the relationship between the tumor glycolytic metabolism and tissue pH by comparing (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) to chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI measurements of tumor pH. METHODS: 10(6) C6 glioma cells were implanted in the brains of male Wistar rats (N = 11) using stereotactic surgery. A 60-min PET acquisition after a bolus of FDG was performed at 11-13 days post implantation, and standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated. CEST measurements were acquired the following day before and during constant infusion of glucose solution. Tumor intracellular pH (pHi) was evaluated using amine and amide concentration-independent detection (AACID) CEST MRI. The change of pH(i) (∆pH(i)) was calculated as the difference between pH(i) pre- and during glucose infusion. Rats were imaged immediately with hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate MRSI. Regional maps of the ratio of Lac:Pyr were acquired. The correlations between SUV, Lac:Pyr ratio, and ∆pH(i) were evaluated using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: A decrease of 0.14 in pH(i) was found after glucose infusion in tumor region. Significant correlations between tumor glycolysis measurements of Lac:Pyr and ∆pH(i) within the tumor (rho = 0.83, P = 0.01) and peritumoral region (rho = 0.76, P = 0.028) were observed. No significant correlations were found between tumor SUV and ∆pH(i) within the tumor (rho =  - 0.45, P = 0.17) and peritumor regions (rho =  - 0.6, P = 0.051). CONCLUSION: AACID detected the changes in pH(i) induced by glucose infusion. Significant correlations between tumor glycolytic measurement of Lac:Pyr and tumoral and peritumoral pH(i) and ∆pH(i) suggest the intrinsic relationship between tumor glycolytic metabolism and the tumor pH environment as well as the peritumor pH environment.

Title: Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype with leptomeningeal metastasis to Meckel's cave: A case report.
Abstract: Meckel's cave or the trigeminal cistern is a subarachnoid space near the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and contains cerebrospinal fluid and the Gasserian ganglion, which divides into the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) nerves. Infectious, inflammatory, congenital, and neoplastic lesions can occur in Meckel's cave. Leptomeningeal metastasis of glioblastoma (GBM), IDH-wildtype to Meckel's cave is rare. We encountered a case of leptomeningeal metastasis of GBM to Meckel's cave in an elderly female patient who presented with pain around her right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enhancing lesions in the right temporal lobe and cervical spinal cord. The pathological diagnosis of GBM was confirmed after biopsy of the cervical spinal cord lesion, which showed hyperaccumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on FDG-positron emission tomography. This case indicates that metastatic lesions can also occur in Meckel's cave.

Title: Serial assessment of multimodality imaging in anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibody encephalitis: A case report.
Abstract: In autoimmune encephalitis, abnormalities of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), arterial spin labeling (ASL) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) have been reported. However, there are few studies of long-term follow-up of imaging. We report a case of anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibody encephalitis whose MRI (DWI, FLAIR and ASL), (99m)TcHM-PAO SPECT (PAO-SPECT) and (18)F-FDG-PET were evaluated through the clinical course. ASL, PAO-SPECT and (18)F-FDG-PET consistently showed abnormalities in almost the same area. Serial assessment of these imaging modalities is useful in evaluating disease activity and efficacy of treatment.

Title: Image-derived Input Function in brain [(18)F]FDG PET data: which alternatives to the carotid siphons?
Abstract: Quantification of brain [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data requires an input function. A noninvasive alternative to gold-standard arterial sampling is the image-derived input function (IDIF), typically extracted from the internal carotid arteries (ICAs), which are however difficult to segment and subjected to spillover effects. In this work, we evaluated the feasibility of extracting the IDIF from two different vascular sites, i.e., 1) common carotids (CCA) and 2) superior sagittal sinus (SSS), other than 3) ICA in a large group of glioma patients undergoing a dynamic [(18)F]FDG PET acquisition on a hybrid PET/MR scanner. Comparisons are drawn between the different IDIFs in terms of peak amplitude and shape, as well as between the estimates of fractional uptake rate (Kr) obtained from the different extraction sites in terms of a) grey/white matter average absolute values, b) ratio of grey-to-white matter, and c) spatial patterns for the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion. Clinical Relevance - This work points towards new feasible IDIF extraction sites (CCA in particular) which could allow for fully noninvasive absolute PET quantification in clinical populations.

Title: Use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in differential diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma and high-grade gliomas: A meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and high-grade glioma (HGG) appear similar under imaging. However, since the two tumors vary in their treatment methods, their differential diagnosis is crucial. The use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) imaging to effectively distinguish between the two tumors is not clear; therefore, a meta-analysis was carried out to determine its effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Science, and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP) were exhaustively searched using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to select high-quality literature. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used for the qualitative assessment of the included literature. The bivariate effect model was used to combine statistics such as sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)], plot summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) value. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the stability of the results, and Deek's test was used to assess publication bias. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis was used to determine the sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of nine studies were included in this study. For differential diagnosis of PCNSL and HGG, the combined SEN was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.80-0.96; I(2) = 46.73%), combined SPE was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93; I(2) = 56.30%), the combined PLR was 7.83 (95% CI: 4.96-12.37; I(2) = 15.57%), combined NLR was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.23; I(2) = 31.99%), combined DOR was 77.36 (95% CI: 32.74-182.77; I(2) = 70.70%). The AUC of SROC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97). No publication bias was found and the sample size and different parameters were the primary reason for heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging technique has a high diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of PNCSL and HGG. Patients suspected to have the above two tumors are suggested to be examined by 18F-FDG-PET / CT to help in the clinical distinction and further treatment modalities.

Title: Multicenter clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI predict ATRX mutation status in IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To develop a clinical radiomics-integrated model based on (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) and multi-modal MRI for predicting alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) mutation status of IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). METHODS: One hundred and two patients (47 ATRX mutant-type, 55 ATRX wild-type) diagnosed with IDH-mutant LGGs (CNS WHO grades 1 and 2) were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 5540 radiomics features were extracted from structural MR (sMR) images (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, CE-T1WI; T2-weighted imaging, and T2WI), functional MR (fMR) images (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC; cerebral blood volume, CBV), and metabolic PET images ([(18)F]FDG PET). The random forest algorithm was used to establish a clinical radiomics-integrated model, integrating the optimal multi-modal radiomics model with three clinical parameters. The predictive effectiveness of the models was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The optimal multi-modal model incorporated sMR (CE-T1WI), fMR (ADC), and metabolic ([(18)F]FDG) images ([(18)F]FDG PET+ADC+ CE-T1WI) with the area under curves (AUCs) in the training and test groups of 0.971 and 0.962, respectively. The clinical radiomics-integrated model, incorporating [(18)F]FDG PET+ADC+CE-T1WI, three clinical parameters (KPS, SFSD, and ATGR), showed the best predictive effectiveness in the training and test groups (0.987 and 0.975, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical radiomics-integrated model with metabolic, structural, and functional information based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI achieved promising performance for predicting the ATRX mutation status of IDH-mutant LGGs. KEY POINTS: * The clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI achieved promising performance for predicting ATRX mutation status in LGGs. * The study investigated the value of multicenter clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI in LGGs regarding ATRX mutation status prediction. * The integrated model provided structural, functional, and metabolic information simultaneously and demonstrated with satisfactory calibration and discrimination in the training and test groups (0.987 and 0.975, respectively).

Title: Role of Molecular Imaging with PET/MR Imaging in the Diagnosis and Management of Brain Tumors.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Hybrid PET/MR imaging has revolutionized brain tumor imaging, allowing for noninvasive, simultaneous assessment of morphologic, functional, metabolic, and molecular parameters within the brain. Molecular information obtained from PET imaging may aid in the detection, classification, prognostication, and therapeutic decision making for gliomas. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been widely used in the setting of brain tumor imaging, and multiple techniques may be employed to optimize this methodology. More recently, a number of non-(18)F-FDG-PET radiotracers have been applied toward brain tumor imaging and are used in clinical practice.

Title: Differentiating solitary brain metastases from glioblastoma by radiomics features derived from MRI and 18F-FDG-PET and the combined application of multiple models.
Abstract: This study aimed to explore the ability of radiomics derived from both MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) images to differentiate glioblastoma (GBM) from solitary brain metastases (SBM) and to investigate the combined application of multiple models. The imaging data of 100 patients with brain tumours (50 GBMs and 50 SBMs) were retrospectively analysed. Three model sets were built on MRI, 18F-FDG-PET, and MRI combined with 18F-FDG-PET using five feature selection methods and five classification algorithms. The model set with the highest average AUC value was selected, in which some models were selected and divided into Groups A, B, and C. Individual and joint voting predictions were performed in each group for the entire data. The model set based on MRI combined with 18F-FDG-PET had the highest average AUC compared with isolated MRI or 18F-FDG-PET. Joint voting prediction showed better performance than the individual prediction when all models reached an agreement. In conclusion, radiomics derived from MRI and 18F-FDG-PET could help differentiate GBM from SBM preoperatively. The combined application of multiple models can provide greater benefits.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Algorithm-Based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the Treatment of Glioma Biopsy.
Abstract: This study was aimed at exploring the application value of positron emission tomography (PET) + magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) in the biopsy and treatment of intracranial glioma. 35 patients with preoperatively suspicious gliomas were selected as the research objects. Their imaging images were processed using CNN. They were performed with the preoperative head MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and ethylcholine (FECH) PET scans to construct the cancer tissue contours. In addition, the performance of CNN was evaluated, and the postoperative pathology of patients was analyzed. The results suggested that the CNN-based PET + MRI technology showed a recognition accuracy of 97% for images. Semiquantitative analysis was adopted to analyze the standard uptake value (SUV). It was found that the SUV(FDG) and SUV(FECH) of grade II/III glioma were 9.77 +/- 4.87 and 1.82 +/- 0.50, respectively, and the SUV(FDG) and SUV(FECH) of grade IV glioma were 13.91 +/- 1.83 and 3.65 +/- 0.34, respectively. According to FDG PET, the mean value of SUV on the lesion side of grade IV glioma was greater than that of grade II-III glioma, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05), and similar results were obtained on FECH PET. It showed that CNN-based PET + MRI fusion technology can effectively improve the recognition effect of glioma, can more accurately determine the scope of glioma lesions, and can predict the degree of malignant glioma to a certain extent.

Title: Cortical and Subcortical Dysmetabolism Are Dynamic Markers of Clinical Disability and Course in Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET study evaluates the accuracy of semiquantitative measurement of putaminal hypermetabolism in identifying anti-leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated-1 (LGI1) protein autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In addition, the extent of brain dysmetabolism, their association with clinical outcomes, and longitudinal metabolic changes after immunotherapy in LGI1-AE are examined. METHODS: FDG-PET scans from 49 age-matched and sex-matched subjects (13 in LGI1-AE group, 15 in non-LGI1-AE group, 11 with Alzheimer disease [AD], and 10 negative controls [NCs]) and follow-up scans from 8 patients with LGI1 AE on a median 6 months after immunotherapy were analyzed. Putaminal standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) normalized to global brain (P-SUVRg), thalamus (P/Th), and midbrain (P/Mi) were evaluated for diagnostic accuracy. SUVRg was applied for all other analyses. RESULTS: P-SUVRg, P/Th, and P/Mi were higher in LGI1-AE group than in non-LGI1-AE group, AD group, and NCs (all p < 0.05). P/Mi and P-SUVRg differentiated LGI1-AE group robustly from other groups (areas under the curve 0.84-0.99). Mediotemporal lobe (MTL) SUVRg was increased in both LGI1-AE and non-LGI1-AE groups when compared with NCs (both p < 0.05). SUVRg was decreased in several frontoparietal regions and increased in pallidum, caudate, pons, olfactory, and inferior occipital gyrus in LGI1-AE group when compared with that in NCs (all p < 0.05). In LGI1-AE group, both MTL and putaminal hypermetabolism were reduced after immunotherapy. Normalization of regional cortical dysmetabolism associated with clinical improvement at the 6- and 20-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Semiquantitative measurement of putaminal hypermetabolism with FDG-PET may be used to distinguish LGI1-AE from other pathologies. Metabolic abnormalities in LGI1-AE extend beyond putamen and MTL into other subcortical and cortical regions. FDG-PET may be used in evaluating disease evolution in LGI1-AE. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that semiquantitative measures of putaminal metabolism on PET can differentiate patients with LGI1-AE from patients without LGI1-AE, patients with AD, or NCs.

Title: Delayed FDG PET Provides Superior Glioblastoma Conspicuity Compared to Conventional Image Timing.
Abstract: Background: Glioblastomas are malignant, often incurable brain tumors. Reliable discrimination between recurrent disease and treatment changes is a significant challenge. Prior work has suggested glioblastoma FDG PET conspicuity is improved at delayed time points vs. conventional imaging times. This study aimed to determine the ideal FDG imaging time point in a population of untreated glioblastomas in preparation for future trials involving the non-invasive assessment of true progression vs. pseudoprogression in glioblastoma. Methods: Sixteen pre-treatment adults with suspected glioblastoma received FDG PET at 1, 5, and 8 h post-FDG injection within the 3 days prior to surgery. Maximum standard uptake values were measured at each timepoint for the central enhancing component of the lesion and the contralateral normal-appearing brain. Results: Sixteen patients (nine male) had pathology confirmed IDH-wildtype, glioblastoma. Our results revealed statistically significant improvements in the maximum standardized uptake values and subjective conspicuity of glioblastomas at later time points compared to the conventional (1 h time point). The tumor to background ratio at 1, 5, and 8 h was 1.4 +/- 0.4, 1.8 +/- 0.5, and 2.1 +/- 0.6, respectively. This was statistically significant for the 5 h time point over the 1 h time point (p > 0.001), the 8 h time point over the 1 h time point (p = 0.026), and the 8 h time point over the 5 h time point (p = 0.036). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that delayed imaging time point provides superior conspicuity of glioblastoma compared to conventional imaging. Further research based on these results may translate into improvements in the determination of true progression from pseudoprogression.

Title: Congress of Neurological Surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update on the role of imaging in the management of progressive glioblastoma in adults.
Abstract: TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults with glioblastoma who have been previously treated with first-line radiation or chemoradiotherapy and who are suspected of experiencing tumor progression. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, is standard contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion weighted imaging useful for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes? LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement including diffusion weighted imaging is recommended as the imaging surveillance method to detect the progression of previously diagnosed glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does magnetic resonance spectroscopy add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL II: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is recommended as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does magnetic resonance perfusion add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: Magnetic resonance perfusion is suggested as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does the addition of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide additional useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging is suggested as a diagnostic method to differentiate true tumor progression from treatment-related imaging changes or pseudo-progression in patients with suspected progressive glioblastoma. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: The routine use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to identify progression of glioblastoma is not recommended. QUESTION: In patients with previously treated glioblastoma, does positron emission tomography with amino acid agents add useful information for diagnosing tumor progression and differentiating progression from treatment-related changes beyond that derived from standard magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement? LEVEL III: It is suggested that amino acid positron emission tomography be considered to assist in the differentiation of progressive glioblastoma from treatment related changes.

Title: Drug-resistant high grade glioma-related epilepsy surgery for focal motor status epilepticus localized by CT-PET imaging.
Abstract: Tumor-related epilepsy is a frequent complication of glioblastoma with seizures often representing the first manifestation of the malignancy. Though tumor resection is associated with improved seizure control, extensive surgery is not always feasible if eloquent cortex is involved in seizure generation and early propagation. We describe a case of a patient with glioblastoma with drug-resistant focal status epilepticus where fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging was successfully used to localize the seizure-onset and optimize tumor resection. This led to successful resection of hypermetabolic tumor tissue and resolution of focal status epilepticus without damage to eloquent cortex.

Title: Subcortical Hypermetabolism Associated With Cortical Hypometabolism Is a Common Metabolic Pattern in Patients With Anti-Leucine-Rich Glioma-Inactivated 1 Antibody Encephalitis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Brain 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) is a sensitive technique for assisting in the diagnosis of patients with anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody encephalitis. However, the common pattern of this disorder assessed by FDG PET remains unknown. The present study aimed to explore the glucose metabolic patterns of this disorder based on PET voxel analysis. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 25 patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis, who were admitted in Beijing Tiantan Hospital between September 2014 and July 2019. The glucose metabolic pattern was compared between the included patients and 44 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Then, the correlation between the metabolic pattern and scaled activities of daily living (ADLs) of the patients was assessed. RESULTS: The median time from symptom onset to PET scans was 9 w (range:2-53w). The groupwise analysis revealed that patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis had left hippocampal hypermetabolism and hypometabolism in almost all neocortical regions. The individual-level results showed most patients presented a decreased metabolism in neocortical regions, as well as an increase in metabolism in the hippocampus and basal ganglia. Furthermore, the metabolic gradient between hippocampus and neocortical regions was positively associated with the ADLs (frontal lobe, r=0.529, P=0.008; parietal lobe, r=0.474, P=0.019; occipital lobe, r=0.413, P=0.045; temporal lobe, r=0.490, P=0.015), respectively. In addition, the patients with facio-brachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) presented bilateral putamen hypermetabolism, when compared to patients without FBDS and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Subcortical hypermetabolism associated with cortical hypometabolism presented with a common metabolic pattern in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis in the present study. The resolution of the metabolic gradient of the hippocampal hypermetabolism and neocortical hypometabolism may bring about improved clinical neurologic disability.

Title: An Integrated Radiomics Model Incorporating Diffusion-Weighted Imaging and (18)F-FDG PET Imaging Improves the Performance of Differentiating Glioblastoma From Solitary Brain Metastases.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of conventional MRI (cMRI)-based radiomics in differentiating glioblastoma (GBM) from solitary brain metastases (SBM) is not satisfactory enough. Therefore, we aimed to develop an integrated radiomics model to improve the performance of differentiating GBM from SBM. METHODS: One hundred patients with solitary brain tumors (50 with GBM, 50 with SBM) were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training set (n = 80) or validation set (n = 20). A total of 4,424 radiomic features were obtained from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) with the contrast-enhancing and peri-enhancing edema region, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) images. The partial least squares (PLS) regression with fivefold cross-validation is used to analyze the correlation between different radiomic features and different modalities. The cross-validity analysis was performed to judge whether a new principal component or a new feature dimension can significantly improve the final prediction effect. The principal components with effective interpretation in all radiomic features were projected to a low-dimensional space (2D in this study). The effective features of the new projection mapping were then sent to the random forest classifier to predict the results. The performance of differentiating GBM from SBM was compared between the integrated radiomics model and other radiomics models or nonradiomics methods using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: Through the cross-validity analysis of partial least squares, hundreds of radiomic features were projected into a new two-dimensional space to complete the construction of radiomics model. Compared with the combined radiomics model using DWI + (18)F-FDG PET (AUC = 0.93, p = 0.014), cMRI + DWI (AUC = 0.89, p = 0.011), cMRI + (8)F-FDG PET (AUC = 0.91, p = 0.015), and single radiomics model using cMRI (AUC = 0.85, p = 0.018), DWI (AUC = 0.84, p = 0.017), and (18)F-FDG PET (AUC = 0.85, p = 0.421), the integrated radiomics model (AUC = 0.98) showed more efficient diagnostic performance. The integrated radiomics model (AUC = 0.98) also showed significantly better performance than any single ADC, SUV, or TBR parameter (AUC = 0.57-0.71, p < 0.05). The integrated radiomics model showed better performance in the training (AUC = 0.98) and validation (AUC = 0.93) sets than any other models and methods, demonstrating robustness. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an integrated radiomics model incorporating DWI and (18)F-FDG PET, which improved the performance of differentiating GBM from SBM greatly.

Title: Correlation between FDG-PET uptake and survival in patients with primary brain tumors.
Abstract: This study evaluates F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) semi-quantitative analysis as biomarker of tumor aggressiveness and predictor of survival in patients with primary brain tumors. Semi-quantitative analyses (SUVmax, SUVmean) were derived from FDG PET images in 78 patients with suspected recurrence of primary brain tumors based on MRI. SUVmax and the ratio of lesion SUVmax to the SUVmean of contralateral white matter (SUVmax/WM) were measured. A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Kaplan-Meier analyses and the log rank test for evaluating statistical significance were utilized. There was statistical significance for time between FDG-PET and patient death. There was a significant difference with respect to FDG-PET time to death between patients with glioblastoma and patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligodendroglioma, and other histological subtypes. There is significant correlation with SUVmax/WM and patient survival following FDG-PET when a cut-point ratio of 1.90 is used. A 1.90 cut-point ratio of SUVmax/WM was associated with a difference in survival. GBM was associated with a significant difference in terms of reduced survival following FDG PET compared to most other histological sub-types. These results may inform current treatment and counseling strategies for patients with primary brain tumors.

Title: Imaging biomarkers for evaluating tumor response: RECIST and beyond.
Abstract: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is the gold standard for assessment of treatment response in solid tumors. Morphologic change of tumor size evaluated by RECIST is often correlated with survival length and has been considered as a surrogate endpoint of therapeutic efficacy. However, the detection of morphologic change alone may not be sufficient for assessing response to new anti-cancer medication in all solid tumors. During the past fifteen years, several molecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapies have emerged in cancer treatment which work by disrupting signaling pathways and inhibited cell growth. Tumor necrosis or lack of tumor progression is associated with a good therapeutic response even in the absence of tumor shrinkage. Therefore, the use of unmodified RECIST criteria to estimate morphological changes of tumor alone may not be sufficient to estimate tumor response for these new anti-cancer drugs. Several studies have reported the low reliability of RECIST in evaluating treatment response in different tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer, brain glioma, bone metastasis, and lymphoma. There is an increased need for new medical imaging biomarkers, considering the changes in tumor viability, metabolic activity, and attenuation, which are related to early tumor response. Promising imaging techniques, beyond RECIST, include dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weight imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). This review outlines the current RECIST with their limitations and the new emerging concepts of imaging biomarkers in oncology.

Title: PET/CT using (68) Ga-PSMA-617 versus (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose to differentiate low- and high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare and characterize metabolic features of high- and low-grade glioma tumors using (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent both (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG PET/CT over 2 consecutive days and then underwent surgical treatment were retrospectively identified. All tumors were diagnosed histologically. This report includes 16 high-grade glioma (HGG) and 14 low-grade glioma (LGG) tumors. Standard uptake value (SUV) and target to nontarget (T/NT) were quantitatively investigated through the entire tumor region. Statistical analyses were performed using area under the curve (AUC) and comparison of two means. RESULTS: SUV(max) and SUV(mean) were the most effective (AUC, 0.96 and 0.94 for PSMA PET; AUC, 0.79 and 0.74 for FDG PET, respectively) for differentiating HGGs from LGGs. These methods distinguished between HGG and LGG effectively (PSMA PET: SUV(max) , 5.766 +/- 3.945 vs. 0.7364 +/- 0.5295, p < 0.0001; SUV(mean) , 1.666 +/- 1.680 and 0.1514 +/- 0.1534, p < 0.0001, respectively) (FDG PET: SUV(max) , 11.67 +/- 3.639 and 9.118 +/- 6.612; SUV(mean) , 5.648 +/- 2.114 and 4.435 +/- 2.872; p = 0.0083, 0.0262, respectively). The Youden index for SUV(max) and SUV(mean) of (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG were 0.82 and 0.79 and 0.54 and 0.61, separately. T/NT(max) was helpful for visual inspection of (68) Ga-PSMA-617-PET images (T/NT(max) : 1.291 +/- 0.9553 in grade II, 5.25 +/- 2.435 in grade III, and 13.61 +/- 13.84 in grade IV). T/NT(max) differed significantly between LGG and HGG and between subtypes of LGG. CONCLUSION: PET/CT with (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG may help distinguish between HGG and LGG, and (68) Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT is superior to(18) F-FDG in differentiating HGG and LGG.

Title: Differentiating between Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma and Glioblastoma: The Diagnostic Value of Combining (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography with Arterial Spin Labeling.
Abstract: Using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, the differentiation of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma (GBM) is often difficult due to overlapping imaging characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of combining (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with arterial spin labeling (ASL) for differentiating PCNSL from GBM. In all, 20 patients with PCNSL and 55 with GBM were retrospectively examined. From the FDG-PET data, the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and the ratio of tumor to normal contralateral gray matter (T/N_SUVmax) were calculated. From the ASL data, the T/N ratio of the maximum tumor blood flow (relative TBFmax: rTBFmax) was obtained. Diagnostic performance of each parameter was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A generalized linear model was applied for comparing the performance of FDG-PET and ASL individually, and in combination. In univariate analysis, SUVmax and T/N_SUVmax were statistically higher in patients with PCNSL and rTBFmax was higher in patients with GBM. In the multivariate analysis, T/N_SUVmax and rTBFmax were statistically independent. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for discriminating PCNSL from GBM were 100%, 87.3%, and 0.950 in T/N_SUVmax; 90%, 72.7%, and 0.824 in rTBFmax; and 95%, 96.4%, and 0.991 in the combined model, respectively. The combined use of T/N_SUVmax and rTBFmax may contribute to better differentiation between PCNSL and GBM.

Title: Characteristics of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FDOPA PET in an 8-year-old neutered male Yorkshire Terrier dog with glioma: long-term chemotherapy using hydroxyurea plus imatinib with prednisolone and immunoreactivity for PDGFR-beta and LAT1.
Abstract: An 8-year-old neutered male Yorkshire Terrier dog presented with head pressing, vestibular ataxia, neck tenderness, and no oculocephalic reflex. A demarcated lesion in the pons was identified on MRI. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with a glioma and was treated with hydroxyurea plus imatinib and prednisolone. After 30 days of therapeutic treatment, the patient showed a clear improvement in neurological signs, which lasted for 1117 days. On day 569 after the initiation of treatment, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) was performed with no significant findings on visual analysis. The average and maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) were 1.92 and 2.29, respectively. The tumor-to-normal-tissue (T/N) ratio was 0.97. The first evidence of clinical deterioration was noticed on day 1147. On day 1155, 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA)-PET was performed. High uptake of (18)F-FDOPA was observed in the intracranial lesion. The mean and maximal SUVs of the tumor were 1.59 and 2.29, respectively. The T/N ratio was 2.22. The patient was euthanized on day 1155 and histopathologic evaluations confirmed glioma (astrocytoma). This case shows that chemotherapy with hydroxyurea plus imatinib may be considered in the treatment of canine glioma. Furthermore, this is the first case describing the application of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FDOPA in a dog with glioma.

Title: Multiple positron emission tomography tracers for use in the classification of gliomas according to the 2016 World Health Organization criteria.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The molecular diagnosis of gliomas such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status (wild-type [wt] or mutation [mut]) is especially important in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Positron emission tomography (PET) has afforded molecular and metabolic diagnostic imaging. The present study aimed to define the interrelationship between the 2016 WHO classification of gliomas and the integrated data from PET images using multiple tracers, including (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG), (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET), (18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), and (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO). METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study comprised 113 patients with newly diagnosed glioma based on the 2016 WHO criteria. Patients were divided into 4 glioma subtypes (Mut, Codel, Wt, and glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]). Tumor standardized uptake value (SUV) divided by mean normal cortical SUV (tumor-normal tissue ratio [TNR]) was calculated for (18)F-FDG, (11)C-MET, and (18)F-FLT. Tumor-blood SUV ratio (TBR) was calculated for (18)F-FMISO. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of PET tracers in distinguishing glioma subtypes, a comparative analysis of TNRs and TBR as well as the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were calculated by Scheffe's multiple comparison procedure for each PET tracer following the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The differences in mean (18)F-FLT TNR and (18)F-FMISO TBR were significant between GBM and other glioma subtypes (P < .001). Regarding the comparison between Gd-T1WI volumes and (18)F-FLT MTVs or (18)F-FMISO MTVs, we identified significant differences between Wt and Mut or Codel (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Combined administration of 4 PET tracers might aid in the preoperative differential diagnosis of gliomas according to the 2016 WHO criteria.

Title: Assessment of the effect of therapy in a rat model of glioblastoma using [18F]FDG and [18F]FCho PET compared to contrast-enhanced MRI.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We investigated the potential of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [18F]Fluoromethylcholine ([18F]FCho) PET, compared to contrast-enhanced MRI, for the early detection of treatment response in F98 glioblastoma (GB) rats. METHODS: When GB was confirmed on T2- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, animals were randomized into a treatment group (n = 5) receiving MRI-guided 3D conformal arc micro-irradiation (20 Gy) with concomitant temozolomide, and a sham group (n = 5). Effect of treatment was evaluated by MRI and [18F]FDG PET on day 2, 5, 9 and 12 post-treatment and [18F]FCho PET on day 1, 6, 8 and 13 post-treatment. The metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was calculated using a semi-automatic thresholding method and the average tracer uptake within the MTV was converted to a standard uptake value (SUV). RESULTS: To detect treatment response, we found that for [18F]FDG PET (SUVmean x MTV) is superior to MTV only. Using (SUVmean x MTV), [18F]FDG PET detects treatment effect starting as soon as day 5 post-therapy, comparable to contrast-enhanced MRI. Importantly, [18F]FDG PET at delayed time intervals (240 min p.i.) was able to detect the treatment effect earlier, starting at day 2 post-irradiation. No significant differences were found at any time point for both the MTV and (SUVmean x MTV) of [18F]FCho PET. CONCLUSIONS: Both MRI and particularly delayed [18F]FDG PET were able to detect early treatment responses in GB rats, whereas, in this study this was not possible using [18F]FCho PET. Further comparative studies should corroborate these results and should also include (different) amino acid PET tracers.

Title: Multimodality In Vivo Imaging of Perfusion and Glycolysis in a Rat Model of C6 Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI using an infusion of glucose (glucoCEST) is sensitive to the distribution of glucose in vivo; however, whether glucoCEST is more related to perfusion or glycolysis is still debatable. We compared glucoCEST to computed tomography perfusion (CTP), [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) in a C6 rat model of glioma to determine if glucoCEST is more strongly correlated with measurements of perfusion or glycolysis. METHODS: 10(6) C6 glioma cells were implanted in Wistar rat brains (n = 11). CTP (including blood volume, BV; blood flow, BF; and permeability surface area product, PS) and FDG-PET standardized uptake value (SUV) were acquired at 11 to 13 days post-surgery. GlucoCEST measurements (∆CEST) were acquired the following day on a 9.4 T MRI before and after an infusion of glucose solution. This was followed by MRSI on a 3.0 T MRI after the injection of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate to generate regional maps of the lactate:pyruvate ratio (Lac:Pyr). Pearson's correlations between glucoCEST, CTP, FDG-PET, and Lac:Pyr ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Tumors had significantly higher SUV, BV, and PS than the contralateral brain. Tumor ∆CEST was most strongly correlated with CTP measurements of BV (rho = 0.74, P = 0.01) and PS (rho = 0.55, P = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between glycolysis measurements of SUV or Lac:Pyr with tumor ∆CEST. PS significantly correlated with SUV (rho = 0.58, P = 0.005) and Lac:Pyr (rho = 0.75, P = 0.005). BV significantly correlated with Lac:Pyr (rho = 0.57, P = 0.02), and BF significantly correlated with SUV (rho = 0.49, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study determined that glucoCEST is more strongly correlated to measurements of perfusion than glycolysis. GlucoCEST measurements have additional confounds, such as sensitivity to changing pH, that merit additional investigation.

Title: BRAF V600E mutation mediates FDG-methionine uptake mismatch in polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young.
Abstract: We present a case of a 14-year old boy with tumor-associated refractory epilepsy. Positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated a region with heterogeneous high (11)C-methionine uptake and a region with homogenous low (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake within the tumor. Histopathological and genomic analyses confirmed the tumor as BRAF V600E-mutated polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY). Within the high-methionine-uptake region, we observed increased protein levels of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), a major transporter of methionine; c-Myc; and constituents of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We also found that LAT1 expression was linked to the BRAF V600E mutation and subsequent activation of MAPK signaling and c-Myc. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the MAPK pathway suppressed c-Myc and LAT1 expression in BRAF V600E-mutated PLNTY and glioblastoma cells. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib moderately suppressed cell viability in PLNTY. Collectively, our results indicate that BRAF V600E mutation-activated MAPK signaling and downstream c-Myc induces specific metabolic alterations in PLNTY, and may represent an attractive target in the treatment of the disease.

Title: Solitary vertebral metastatic glioblastoma in the absence of primary brain tumor relapse: a case report and literature review.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metastatic glioblastoma presenting as a solitary osteolytic cervical vertebral mass without primary brain tumor relapse is extremely rare with only 1 reported case in the literature. Because of its rarity, it can be easily overlooked and misdiagnosed, posing a diagnostic dilemma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old man with right temporal glioblastoma was initially treated by tumor resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Eighteen months after surgery, he was readmitted with complaints of neck pain for 2 weeks. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed a solitary FDG-avid osteolytic lesion in the 4th cervical vertebral body without other abnormal FDG-uptake in the body and in the absence of local recurrence at the resection cavity. Because of the sudden worsening situation and intractable neck pain, the patient underwent tumor resection. Postoperatively, the pain was obviously reduced and the situation was improved. Interestingly, the immunohistochemical findings of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicated the characteristic of metastatic glioblastoma, despite that the histopathological findings of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining was suspicious of osteoclastoma. According to the clinical history, imaging findings, pathological and immunohistochemical results, a final diagnosis of solitary vertebral metastasis from glioblastoma without central nervous system (CNS) relapse was confirmed. Then, the patient received radiotherapy on spine and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, he died suddenly 2 months after the tumor resection, nearly 21 months after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We emphasize that metastatic glioblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a solitary FDG-avid osteolytic vertebral mass on PET/CT. And the diagnosis of extracranial metastasis (ECM) from glioblastoma can be achieved through clinical history, imaging findings, pathological examination, and immunohistochemical staining with GFAP.

Title: Glucose Loading Enhances the Value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the Characterization and Delineation of Cerebral Gliomas.
Abstract: This study aimed to assess how to enhance the value of (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CTs for glioma grading and better delineation of the tumor boundary by glucose loading. In mouse models of brain tumor using U87MG cells, (18)F-FDG-PET images were obtained after fasting and after glucose loading. There was a significant difference in the tumor-to-normal cortex-uptake ratio (TNR) between the fasting and glucose-loading scans. (14)C-2-Deoxy-D-glucose ((14)C-DG) uptake was measured in vitro using U87MG, U373MG and primary neurons cultured with different concentrations of glucose. The tumor-to-neuron ratio of (14)C-DG uptake increased with up to 10 mM of glucose. Finally, 10 low-grade and 17 high-grade glioma patients underwent fasting and glucose loading (18)F-FDG PET/CT and the TNR was compared between scans. The effect of glucose loading was significant in high-grade but not in low-grade gliomas. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with a cut-off TNR of 0.81 showed a higher area under the curve after glucose loading than fasting for differentiating low-grade versus high-grade gliomas. In addition, the glucose loading PET/CT was more useful than the fasting PET/CT for the discrimination of oligodendrogliomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Glucose loading resulted in a greater reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake in the normal cortex than in tumors, which increases the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for grading.

Title: Value of [(18)F]-FDG positron emission tomography in patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) with bevacizumab can induce MRI changes that confound the determination of progression. We sought to determine the value of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in GBM patients receiving bevacizumab at the time of suspected progression and, thereby, its utility as a potential prognostic adjunct in progressive disease. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who underwent brain FDG PET within 4 weeks of receiving bevacizumab for recurrent GBM with suspected progression. Volumes-of-interest were placed over the reference lesion with measurement of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), peak standardized uptake value (SUV(peak)), metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and tumor-to-normal contralateral white matter ratios (TNR-WM). Tumors were additionally categorized as non-avid or avid based on qualitative FDG uptake. Associations between baseline variables and overall survival (OS) were examined using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were analyzed. Qualitative FDG uptake was significantly associated with OS (P = .03), with a median OS of 9.0 months in non-avid patients versus 4.5 months in avid patients. SUV(max), SUV(peak), TNR-WM, and TLG were significantly associated with OS (P < .001, TLG: P = .009). FDG avidity and SUV(max) remained significantly associated with OS (P = .046 and .048, respectively) in the multivariable analysis including age, KPS, and MGMT status. Dichotomizing patients using an SUV(max) cutoff of 15.3 was associated with OS (adjusted P = .048). CONCLUSION: FDG PET is a promising imaging tool to further stratify prognosis in recurrent GBM patients on antiangiogenic therapy.

Title: Psychiatric Manifestation of Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is typically characterized by limbic encephalitis, faciobrachial dystonic seizures and hyponatremia. The frequency with which milder forms of anti-LGI1 encephalitis mimic isolated psychiatric syndromes, such as psychoses, or may lead to dementia if untreated, is largely unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, the authors present a 50-year-old patient who had suffered from neurocognitive deficits and predominant delusions for over one and a half years. He reported a pronounced feeling of thirst, although he was drinking 10-20 liters of water each day, and he was absolutely convinced that he would die of thirst. Due to insomnia in the last five years, the patient took Z-drugs; later, he also abused alcohol. Two years prior to admission, he developed a status epilepticus which had been interpreted as a withdrawal seizure. In his serum, anti-LGI1 antibodies were repeatedly detected by different independent laboratories. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses revealed slightly increased white blood cell counts and evidence for blood-brain-barrier dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities mesio-temporally and in the right amygdala. In addition, there was a slight grey-white matter blurring. A cerebral [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) examination of his brain showed moderate hypometabolism of the bilateral rostral mesial to medial frontal cortices. Treatment attempts with various psychotropic drugs remained unsuccessful in terms of symptom relief. After the diagnosis of probable chronified anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made, two glucocorticoid pulse treatments were performed, which led to a slight improvement of mood and neurocognitive deficits. Further therapy was not desired by the patient and his legally authorized parents. CONCLUSION: This case study describes a patient with anti-LGI1 encephalitis in the chronified stage and a predominant long-lasting psychiatric course with atypical symptoms of psychosis and typical neurocognitive deficits. The patient's poor response to anti-inflammatory drugs was probably due to the delayed start of treatment. This delay in diagnosis and treatment may also have led to the FDG-PET findings, which were compatible with frontotemporal dementia ("state of damage"). In similar future cases, newly occurring epileptic seizures associated with psychiatric symptoms should trigger investigations for possible autoimmune encephalitis, even in patients with addiction or other pre-existing psychiatric conditions. This should in turn result in rapid organic clarification and-in positive cases-to anti-inflammatory treatment. Early treatment of anti-LGI1 encephalitis during the "inflammatory activity state" is crucial for overall prognosis and may avoid the development of dementia in some cases. Based on this case, the authors advocate the concept-long established in many chronic inflammatory diseases in rheumatology-of distinguishing between an "acute inflammatory state" and a "state of organ damage" in autoimmune psychosis resembling neurodegenerative mechanisms.

Title: The Additional Value of (18)F-FDG PET and MRI in Patients with Glioma: A Review of the Literature from 2015 to 2020.
Abstract: AIM: Beyond brain computed tomography (CT) scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) hold paramount importance in neuro-oncology. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the literature from 2015 to 2020, showing advantages or complementary information of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET imaging to the anatomical and functional data offered by MRI in patients with glioma. METHODS: A comprehensive Pubmed/MEDLINE literature search was performed to retrieve original studies, with a minimum of 10 glioma patients, published from 2015 until the end of April 2020, on the use of (18)F-FDG PET in conjunction with MRI. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were selected. Combined use of the two modalities improves the accuracy in predicting prognosis, planning treatments, and evaluating recurrence. CONCLUSION: According to the recent literature, (18)F-FDG PET provides different and complementary information to MRI and may enhance performance in the whole management of gliomas. Therefore, integrated PET/MRI may be particularly useful in gliomas, since it could provide accurate morphological and metabolic information in one-shoot examination and improve the diagnostic value compared to each of procedures.

Title: TSPO imaging-guided characterization of the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor microenvironment in patients with malignant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent immunosuppressors in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). Their infiltration is associated with tumor grade, progression, and therapy resistance. Specific tools for image-guided analysis of spatiotemporal changes in the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor compartments are missing. We aimed (i) to evaluate the role of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)DPA-714* (translocator protein [TSPO]) PET-MRI in the assessment of the immunosuppressive TME in glioma patients, and (ii) to cross-correlate imaging findings with in-depth immunophenotyping. METHODS: To characterize the glioma TME, a mixed collective of 9 glioma patients underwent [18F]DPA-714-PET-MRI in addition to [18F]fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET)-PET-MRI. Image-guided biopsy samples were immunophenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In vitro autoradiography was performed for image validation and assessment of tracer binding specificity. RESULTS: We found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, P = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs). TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumor-infiltrating HLA-DR+ MDSCs and TAMs. [18F]DPA-714-positive tissue volumes exceeded [18F]FET-positive volumes and showed a differential spatial distribution. CONCLUSION: [18F]DPA-714-PET may be used to non-invasively image the glioma-associated immunosuppressive TME in vivo. This imaging paradigm may also help to characterize the heterogeneity of the glioma TME with respect to the degree of myeloid cell infiltration at various disease stages. [18F]DPA-714 may also facilitate the development of new image-guided therapies targeting the myeloid-derived TME.

Title: First-in-Human Phase I Study to Evaluate the Brain-Penetrant PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor GDC-0084 in Patients with Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: GDC-0084 is an oral, brain-penetrant small-molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR. A first-in-human, phase I study was conducted in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GDC-0084 was administered orally, once daily, to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) was performed to measure metabolic responses. RESULTS: Forty-seven heavily pretreated patients enrolled in eight cohorts (2-65 mg). Dose-limiting toxicities included 1 case of grade 2 bradycardia and grade 3 myocardial ischemia (15 mg), grade 3 stomatitis (45 mg), and 2 cases of grade 3 mucosal inflammation (65 mg); the MTD was 45 mg/day. GDC-0084 demonstrated linear and dose-proportional PK, with a half-life ( approximately 19 hours) supportive of once-daily dosing. At 45 mg/day, steady-state concentrations exceeded preclinical target concentrations producing antitumor activity in xenograft models. FDG-PET in 7 of 27 patients (26%) showed metabolic partial response. At doses >/=45 mg/day, a trend toward decreased median standardized uptake value in normal brain was observed, suggesting central nervous system penetration of drug. In two resection specimens, GDC-0084 was detected at similar levels in tumor and brain tissue, with a brain tissue/tumor-to-plasma ratio of >1 and >0.5 for total and free drug, respectively. Best overall response was stable disease in 19 patients (40%) and progressive disease in 26 patients (55%); 2 patients (4%) were nonevaluable. CONCLUSIONS: GDC-0084 demonstrated classic PI3K/mTOR-inhibitor related toxicities. FDG-PET and concentration data from brain tumor tissue suggest that GDC-0084 crossed the blood-brain barrier.

Title: A Non-invasive Radiomic Method Using (18)F-FDG PET Predicts Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Genotype and Prognosis in Patients With Glioma.
Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to analyze (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) images via the radiomic method to develop a model and validate the potential value of features reflecting glioma metabolism for predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genotype and prognosis. Methods: PET images of 127 patients were retrospectively analyzed. A series of quantitative features reflecting the metabolic heterogeneity of the tumors were extracted, and a radiomic signature was generated using the support vector machine method. A combined model that included clinical characteristics and the radiomic signature was then constructed by multivariate logistic regression to predict the IDH genotype status, and the model was evaluated and verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Finally, Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to analyze overall survival (OS) according to the predicted result. Results: The generated radiomic signature was significantly associated with IDH genotype (p < 0.05) and could achieve large areas under the ROC curve of 0.911 and 0.900 on the training and validation cohorts, respectively, with the incorporation of age and type of tumor metabolism. The good agreement of the calibration curves in the validation cohort further validated the efficacy of the constructed model. Moreover, the predicted results showed a significant difference in OS between high- and low-risk groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the (18)F-FDG metabolism-related features could effectively predict the IDH genotype of gliomas and stratify the OS of patients with different prognoses.

Title: Individualized discrimination of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in glioma patients using an integrated radiomics-based model.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop and validate an integrated model for discriminating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in glioma patients. METHODS: Data from 160 pathologically confirmed glioma patients were analyzed. The diagnostic model was developed in a primary cohort (n = 112). Textural features were extracted from postoperative (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET, and magnetic resonance images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a model for predicting tumor recurrence. The radiomics signature, quantitative PET parameters, and clinical risk factors were incorporated in the model. The clinical value of the model was then assessed in an independent validation cohort using the remaining 48 glioma patients. RESULTS: The integrated model consisting of 15 selected features was significantly associated with postoperative tumor recurrence (p < 0.001 for both primary and validation cohorts). Predictors contained in the individualized diagnosis model included the radiomics signature, the mean of tumor-background ratio (TBR) of (18)F-FDG, maximum of TBR of (11)C-MET PET, and patient age. The integrated model demonstrated good discrimination, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.988, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.975-1.000. Application in the validation cohort showed good differentiation (AUC of 0.914 and 95% CI of 0.881-0.945). Decision curve analysis showed that the integrated diagnosis model was clinically useful. CONCLUSIONS: Our developed model could be used to assist the postoperative individualized diagnosis of tumor recurrence in patients with gliomas.

Title: Contribution of Different Positron Emission Tomography Tracers in Glioma Management: Focus on Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Although rare, glioblastomas account for the majority of primary brain lesions, with a dreadful prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the imaging method providing the higher resolution. However, it does not always succeed in distinguishing recurrences from non-specific temozolomide, have been shown to improve -related changes caused by the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, also called pseudoprogression. Strenuous attempts to overcome this issue is highly required for these patients with a short life expectancy for both ethical and economic reasons. Additional reliable information may be obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The development of this technique, along with the emerging of new classes of tracers, can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of therapies. We reviewed the current data about the commonly used tracers, such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and radiolabeled amino acids, as well as different PET tracers recently investigated, to report their strengths, limitations, and relevance in glioblastoma management.

Title: PSMA-Targeting Positron Emission Agents for Imaging Solid Tumors Other Than Non-Prostate Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: Despite its name, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been shown using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to also be over-expressed in the tumor neovasculature of a wide variety of solid tumors other than prostate carcinoma. Accordingly, positron-emitting radiolabeled small molecules targeting PSMA, initially developed for positron emission tomography in prostate carcinomas, are currently being explored for their staging and restaging potential as an alternative imaging modality in other solid tumor types where 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET imaging has low diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, the currently available literature in this field is reviewed. Preliminary, mainly retrospective studies are encouraging, with evidence of improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in clear cell renal carcinoma, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to a change in patient management in several patients. However, the results published thus far warrant confirmation by larger prospective studies additionally assessing the longitudinal impact on patient outcomes.

Title: A Mistaken Diagnosis of Secondary Glioblastoma as Parasitosis.
Abstract: Background: Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis requiring early diagnosis. Secondary glioblastoma refers to cases that progressed from low-grade glioma. Evidence shows that timely resection correlates with increased survival. Case presentation: We describe a case of a patient with secondary glioblastoma who was mistakenly diagnosed with Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection until 7 years after disease onset. The patient presented with non-specific clinical manifestations at disease onset. A conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the primary survey provided insufficient information, and thus failed to identify the malignancy. During follow-up, unfortunately, clinicians were misled by the patient's raw food diet, a positive serum parasite antibody and a result of low glucose metabolism on Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT). The patient was diagnosed with parasitosis. However, his condition kept getting worse under antiparasitic treatment. Preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) failed to reverse the mistaken impression. Final diagnosis was confirmed until intraoperative and postoperative pathological findings indicated glioblastoma. Conclusion: We ascribe the incorrect diagnosis to insufficient understanding on imaging manifestations of brain neoplasm as well as clinical features of parasitosis. Thus, we review the MRI, FDG-PET-CT, MRS, and DTI data of this case according to the timeline, refer to relevant studies, and point out the pitfalls. With a long course of slowly progressing, this was a rare case of secondary glioblastoma with the absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation.

Title: Diagnostic Performance and Prognostic Value of PET/CT with Different Tracers for Brain Tumors: A Systematic Review of Published Meta-Analyses.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several meta-analyses reporting data on the diagnostic performance or prognostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) with different tracers in detecting brain tumors have been published so far. This review article was written to summarize the evidence-based data in these settings. METHODS: We have performed a comprehensive literature search of meta-analyses published in the Cochrane library and PubMed/Medline databases (from inception through July 2019) about the diagnostic performance or prognostic value of PET with different tracers in patients with brain tumors. RESULTS: We have summarized the results of 24 retrieved meta-analyses on the use of PET or PET/computed tomography (CT) with different tracers in brain tumors. The tracers included were: fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG), carbon-11 methionine ((11)C-methionine), fluorine-18 fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET), fluorine-18 dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA), fluorine-18 fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), and carbon-11 choline ((11)C-choline). Evidence-based data demonstrated good diagnostic performance of PET with different tracers in detecting brain tumors, in particular, radiolabelled amino acid tracers showed the highest diagnostic performance values. All the PET tracers evaluated had significant prognostic value in patients with glioma. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based data showed a good diagnostic performance for some PET tracers in specific indications and significant prognostic value in brain tumors.

Title: (18)F-FDG-PET-based Radiomics signature predicts MGMT promoter methylation status in primary diffuse glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The methylation status of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter has emerged as a favorable independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in glioma. This study aimed to build a radiomics signature based on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for noninvasive measurement of the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma. METHODS: One hundred and seven pathology-confirmed primary diffuse glioma patients were retrospectively included and randomly assigned to the primary (n = 71) or validation cohort (n = 36). The MGMT promoter methylation status was measured by pyrosequencing. A total of 1561 radiomics features were extracted from the three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) on the standard uptake value (SUV) maps that were generated from the original (18)F-FDG PET data. A radiomics signature, a clinical signature and a fusion signature that combined the clinical and radiomics features together were generated. The performance of the three signatures was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the patient prognosis was stratified based on the MGMT promoter methylation status and the signature with the best performance. RESULTS: Five radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, and displayed the best performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reaching 0.94 and 0.86 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively, which outweigh the performances of clinical signature and fusion signature. With a median follow-up time of 32.4 months, the radiomics signature stratified the glioma patients into two risk groups with significantly different prognoses (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG-PET-based radiomics is a promising approach for preoperatively evaluating the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma and predicting the prognosis of glioma patients noninvasively.

Title: Usefulness of positron emission tomography for differentiating gliomas according to the 2016 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is important in the noninvasive diagnostic imaging of gliomas. There are many PET studies on glioma diagnosis based on the 2007 WHO classification; however, there are no studies on glioma diagnosis using the new classification (the 2016 WHO classification). Here, the authors investigated the relationship between uptake of 11C-methionine (MET), 11C-choline (CHO), and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on PET imaging and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status (wild-type [IDH-wt] or mutant [IDH-mut]) in astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors according to the 2016 WHO classification. METHODS: In total, 105 patients with newly diagnosed cerebral gliomas (6 diffuse astrocytomas [DAs] with IDH-wt, 6 DAs with IDH-mut, 7 anaplastic astrocytomas [AAs] with IDH-wt, 24 AAs with IDH-mut, 26 glioblastomas [GBMs] with IDH-wt, 5 GBMs with IDH-mut, 19 oligodendrogliomas [ODs], and 12 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas [AOs]) were included. All OD and AO patients had both IDH-mut and 1p/19q codeletion. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tumor/mean SUV of normal cortex (T/N) ratios for MET, CHO, and FDG were calculated, and the mean T/N ratios of DA, AA, and GBM with IDH-wt and IDH-mut were compared. The diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing gliomas with IDH-wt from those with IDH-mut was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the mean T/N ratios for the 3 PET tracers. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the mean T/N ratios for all 3 PET tracers between the IDH-wt and IDH-mut groups of all histological classifications (p < 0.001). Among the 27 gliomas with mean T/N ratios higher than the cutoff values for all 3 PET tracers, 23 (85.2%) were classified into the IDH-wt group using ROC analysis. In DA, there were no significant differences in the T/N ratios for MET, CHO, and FDG between the IDH-wt and IDH-mut groups. In AA, the mean T/N ratios of all 3 PET tracers in the IDH-wt group were significantly higher than those in the IDH-mut group (p < 0.01). In GBM, the mean T/N ratio in the IDH-wt group was significantly higher than that in the IDH-mut group for both MET (p = 0.034) and CHO (p = 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the ratio for FDG. CONCLUSIONS: PET imaging using MET, CHO, and FDG was suggested to be informative for preoperatively differentiating gliomas according to the 2016 WHO classification, particularly for differentiating IDH-wt and IDH-mut tumors.

Title: Diagnostic performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the evaluation of glioma.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Identifying glioma grade through imaging allows clinicians to recommend and accurately direct treatment. We sought to quantify the utility of FDG-PET/CT (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography), alone and in combination with MRI, in identifying high-grade regions of glioma. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients who had an FDG-PET/CT performed as part of the workup of suspected glioma or in follow-up of known glioma. FDG-PET/CT scans were reviewed and uptake in the identifiable lesion coded as none, diffusely or focally increased. Patients also underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI, noting regions of contrast enhancement. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated for identification of high-grade histology (WHO III or IV, or metastatic disease) obtained post-FDG-PET/CT. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients had 36 FDG-PET/CT and MRI scans followed by histological confirmation (biopsy or debulking). Increased FDG uptake demonstrated a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 79%, PPV of 81% and NPV of 55% for identification of high-grade histology. MRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 86%, PPV of 89% and NPV of 71% for identification of high-grade histology. Only 64% of MRI and FDG-PET/CT scan series were concordant. When FDG-PET/CT and MRI were concordant, a specificity of 100% and PPV of 100% was achieved, however, sensitivity was 79% and NPV was 75%. CONCLUSION: The combination of FDG-PET/CT and gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated marked improvement in identifying potential high-grade disease over each modality alone. Increased FDG uptake without gadolinium enhancement rarely occurred and identified high-grade histology in a small number of patients. Due to limited sensitivity and NPV, a negative FDG-PET/CT alone, or in combination with MRI, should not guide a decision for observation where surgery would otherwise be recommended.

Title: Performance of 18F-FDG, 11C-Methionine, and 18F-FET PET for Glioma Grading: A Meta-analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Gliomas constitute the most frequent primary brain tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common and malignant glioma in adults, has dismal prognosis with any current therapy. On the other hand, low-grade gliomas, the second most common type of gliomas, are potentially curative with appropriate treatment. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the performance of PET tracers with the best available evidence, namely, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), C-methionine (MET), and F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET), in differentiating low- from high-grade gliomas. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with a total of 994 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivities of both MET PET and FET PET were found to be significantly higher than of FDG PET (94%, 88%, and 63% respectively, P < 0.001). The pooled specificity of FDG PET was found to be significantly greater compared with both MET PET and FET PET (89%, 55%, and 57%, respectively; P = 0.002). Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was superior in terms of higher positive likelihood ratio values compared with both FET PET and MET PET. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that both MET and FET were superior to FDG in terms of sensitivity for identifying glioma grade.

Title: Pattern of failure in anaplastic glioma patients with an IDH1/2 mutation.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The current study aimed to assess patterns of failure (PoF) in anaplastic glioma (AG) patients managed with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and their relationship to molecular subtype. METHODS: The outcomes of AG patients managed between 2008 and 2014 and entered into a prospective database were assessed, including PoF. AG was initially defined using the WHO 2007 classification, but for analysis, patients were subsequently recategorised based on WHO 2016 as anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AOD), astrocytoma isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant (AAmut) or astrocytoma IDH wildtype (AAwt). Management involved IMRT and temozolomide (TMZ), including from 2011 patients with an IDH mutation (IDHmut) planned with 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET). PoF was local, marginal or distant in relation to the IMRT volume. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the start of IMRT. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were assessed, with median follow-up of 5.1 years. Of these patients, 75% were IDHmut, 44% were managed at first or later relapse and 73% received TMZ. Relapse occurred in 68 patients, with 6‑year RFS of 75.0, 48.8 and 2.5% for AOD, AAmut and AAwt, respectively (p < 0.001). There was a component of local relapse in 63%, of marginal relapse in 19% and of distant relapse in 37% of relapses. Isolated local, marginal and distant relapse was evident in 51, 9 and 22%, respectively. A distant relapse pattern was more frequent in IDHmut compared to IDHwt patients (26% vs. 45%, p = 0.005), especially within the first 2 years post-IMRT. In multivariate analysis, distant relapse remained associated with AAmut (p < 0.002) and delayed IMRT until the second relapse (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although patients with IDH-mutated AG have improved outcomes, there was a higher proportion of distant relapses occurring during the 2 years after IMRT.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of (13)N-ammonia PET, (11)C-methionine PET and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET: a comparative study in patients with suspected cerebral glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with glioma depended on the nature of the lesion and on histological grade of the tumor. Positron emission tomography (PET) using (13)N-ammonia (NH(3)), (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have been used to assess brain tumors. Our aim was to compare their diagnostic accuracies in patients with suspected cerebral glioma. METHODS: Ninety patients with suspicion of glioma based on previous CT/MRI, who underwent NH(3) PET, MET PET and FDG PET, were prospectively enrolled in the study. The reference standard was established by histology or clinical and radiological follow-up. Images were interpreted by visual evaluation and semi-quantitative analysis using the lesion-to-normal white matter uptake ratio (L/WM ratio). RESULTS: Finally, 30 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 27 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 10 non-glioma tumors and 23 non-neoplastic lesions (NNL) were diagnosed. On visual evaluation, sensitivity and specificity for differentiating tumors from NNL were 62.7% (42/67) and 95.7% (22/23) for NH(3) PET, 94.0% (63/67) and 56.5% (13/23) for MET PET, and 35.8% (24/67) and 65.2% (15/23) for FDG PET. On semi-quantitative analysis, brain tumors showed significantly higher L/WM ratios than NNL both in NH(3) and MET PET (both P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, respectively, were 64.2, 100% and 0.819 for NH(3); and 89.6, 69.6% and 0.840 for MET. Besides, the L/WM ratios of NH(3), MET and FDG PET in HGG all significantly higher than that in LGG (all P < 0.001). The predicted (by ROC) accuracy of the tracers (AUC shown in parentheses) were 86.0% (0.896) for NH(3), 87.7% (0.928) for MET and 93.0% (0.964) for FDG. While no significant differences in the AUC were seen between them. CONCLUSION: NH(3) PET has remarkably high specificity for the differentiation of brain tumors from NNL, but low sensitivity for the detection of LGG. MET PET was found to be highly useful for detection of brain tumors. However, like FDG, high MET uptake is frequently observed in some NNL. NH(3), MET and FDG PET all appears to be valuable for evaluating the histological grade of gliomas.

Title: Ictal FDGPET and SPECT in hemifacial seizures due to cerebellar epilepsy-Case report.
Abstract: The role of cerebellum in seizure generation is debatable. Semiology and electroencephalography (EEG) findings are non-specific and sometimes misleading, posing further difficulty in proving the epileptogenicity in pre-surgical workup. We report two cases of cerebellar lesions who presented with hemifacial seizures since the neonatal period and were refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Both inter-ictal and ictal EEGs were non-contributory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lesion in the cerebellum, in proximity to cerebellar peduncle in both the patients. (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed focal hypermetabolism and hyperperfusion respectively, corresponding to the lesion on MRI in both the cases. Intraoperative electrocorticography showed rhythmic spikes confirming the epileptogenic nature of the lesion. Both patients were operated with a favorable surgical outcome. Histopathology was suggestive of a ganglioglioma in one child and a low-grade glioma in the other. Both cases illustrate that FDG-PET and SPECT can act as surrogate markers for invasive recordings to prove the epileptogenicity of cerebellar lesions, especially in resource limited settings.

Title: Comparison of dual-time point 18F-FDG PET/CT tumor-to-background ratio, intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence scale, and Ki-67 index in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare preoperative dual-time point F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake pattern with intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence in high-grade gliomas. In addition, we assessed for possible associations with a pathologic parameter (Ki-67 index).Thirty-one patients with high-grade glioma (M:F = 19:12, mean age = 60.6 +/- 11.2 years) who underwent dual-time point F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan before surgery were retrospectively enrolled; 5-ALA was applied to the surgical field of all these patients and its fluorescence intensity was evaluated during surgery. Measured F-FDG PET/CT parameters were maximum and peak tumor-to-background ratio (maxTBR and peakTBR) at base (-base) and delayed (-delay) scan. The intensity of 5-ALA fluorescence was graded on a scale of three (grade I as no or mild intensity, grade II as moderate intensity, and grade III as strong intensity).Seven of the patients had WHO grade III brain tumors and 24 had WHO grade IV tumors (mean tumor size = 4.8 +/- 1.8 cm). MaxTBR-delay and peakTBR-delay showed significantly higher values than maxTBR-base and peakTBR-base, respectively (all P < .001). Among the F-FDG PET/CT parameters, only maxTBR-delay demonstrated significance according to grade of 5-ALA (P = .030), and maxTBR-delay gradually decreased as the fluorescence intensity increased. Also, maxTBR-delay and peakTBR-delay showed significant positive correlation with Ki-67 index (P = .011 and .009, respectively).Delayed F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images could reflect proliferation in high-grade glioma, and it has a complementary role with 5-ALA fluorescence.

Title: PET imaging in glioma: techniques and current evidence.
Abstract: PET holds potential to provide additional information about tumour metabolic processes, which could aid brain tumour differential diagnosis, grading, molecular subtyping and/or the distinction of therapy effects from disease recurrence. This review discusses PET techniques currently in use for untreated and treated glioma characterization and aims to critically assess the evidence for different tracers ([F]Fluorodeoxyglucose, choline and amino acid tracers) in this context.

Title: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis in post-treatment glioma patients: A comparative study of arterial spin labelling and dynamic susceptibility contrast.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) in post-treatment glioma patients, and to compare the performance of arterial spin labelling (ASL) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) in detecting CCD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included 130 patients who had both DSC and ASL. Among them, 16 had underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT). We investigated the relationship between CCD and the location and size of supratentorial lesions, and compared PET diagnostic performance with that of ASL and DSC. We assessed the inter-methods agreement for ASL and DSC, and performed quantitative analysis by calculating the asymmetry index (AI) between bilateral cerebellum and exploring how the AI values for ASL-CBF, DSC-rCBF, and DSC-rCBV maps correlated with each other. RESULT: Supratentorial lesions affecting the corona radiata (P < 0.001), basal ganglia (P < 0.001), and insula (P = 0.046) were significantly associated with the occurrence of CCD. Lesion size was significantly larger (P = 0.005) in the CCD positive group. With PET as a reference, ASL-CBF and DSC-rCBF maps exhibited the best diagnostic performance compared with the other DSC-generated maps (diagnostic accuracy = 83.3% for both, area under curve (AUC) of ASL = 0.967, AUC of rCBF = 0.983), although differences were not statistically significant. The kappa value for the inter-methods (ASL and DSC) agreement in detecting CCD was 0.893, while the degree of perfusion asymmetry was more significant in ASL- than DSC-generated maps. Bland-Altman plots showed that the AI for ASL-CBF was moderately correlated with those for DSC-rCBF and DSC-rCBV. CONCLUSIONS: CCD can present in post-treatment glioma patients and is detectable on MR-perfusion images including ASL-CBF, DSC-rCBF, and DSC-rCBV maps.

Title: 11C-methionine-18F-FDG dual-PET-tracer-based target delineation of malignant glioma: evaluation of its geometrical and clinical features for planning radiation therapy.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: It is important to correctly and precisely define the target volume for radiotherapy (RT) of malignant glioma. 11C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) holds promise for detecting areas of glioma cell infiltration: the authors' previous research showed that the magnitude of disruption of MET and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake correlation (decoupling score [DS]) precisely reflects glioma cell invasion. The purpose of the present study was to analyze volumetric and geometrical properties of RT target delineation based on DS and compare them with those based on MRI. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of malignant glioma were included in this study. Three target volumes were compared: 1) contrast-enhancing core lesions identified by contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1Gd), 2) high-intensity lesions on T2-weighted images, and 3) lesions showing high DS (DS >/= 3; hDS). The geometrical differences of these target volumes were assessed by calculating the probabilities of overlap and one encompassing the other. The correlation of geometrical features of RT planning and recurrence patterns was further analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that T1Gd with a 2.0-cm margin was able to cover the entire high DS area only in 6 (24%) patients, which indicates that microscopic invasion of glioma cells often extended more than 2.0 cm beyond a Gd-enhanced core lesion. Insufficient coverage of high DS regions with RT target volumes was suggested to be a risk for out-of-field recurrence. Higher coverage of hDS by T1Gd with a 2-cm margin (i.e., higher values of "[T1Gd + 2 cm]/hDS") had a trend to positively impact overall and progression-free survival. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that low coverage of hDS by T1Gd with a 2-cm margin was predictive of disease recurrence outside the Gd-enhanced core lesion, indicative of out-of-field reoccurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that MRI is inadequate for target delineation for RT in malignant glioma treatment. Expanding the treated margins substantially beyond the MRI-based target volume may reduce the risk of undertreatment, but it may also result in unnecessary irradiation of uninvolved regions. As MET/FDG PET-DS seems to provide more accurate information for target delineation than MRI in malignant glioma treatment, this method should be further evaluated on a larger scale.

Title: [(18)F]Fludarabine-PET as a promising tool for differentiating CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma: Comparative analysis with [(18)F]FDG in human xenograft models.
Abstract: This paper investigated whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [(18)F]fludarabine ([(18)F]FDB) can help to differentiate central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) from glioblastoma (GBM), which is a crucial issue in the diagnosis and management of patients with these aggressive brain tumors. Multimodal analyses with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology have also been considered to address the specificity of [(18)F]FDB for CNSL. Methods: Nude rats were implanted with human MC116 lymphoma-cells (n = 9) or U87 glioma-cells (n = 4). Tumor growth was monitored by MRI, with T2-weighted sequence for anatomical features and T1-weighted with gadolinium (Gd) enhancement for blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability assessment. For PET investigation, [(18)F]FDB or [(18)F]FDG (~11 MBq) were injected via tail vein and dynamic PET images were acquired up to 90 min after radiotracer injection. Paired scans of the same rat with the two [(18)F]-labelled radiotracers were investigated. Initial volumes of interest were manually delineated on T2w images and set on co-registered PET images and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated to semi-quantitatively assess the tracer accumulation in the tumor. A tile-based method for image analysis was developed in order to make comparative analysis between radiotracer uptake and values extracted from immunohistochemistry staining. Results: In the lymphoma model, PET time-activity curves (TACs) revealed a differential response of [(18)F]FDB between tumoral and healthy tissues with average TBR varying from 2.45 to 3.16 between 5 to 90 min post-injection. In contrast, [(18)F]FDG demonstrated similar uptake profiles for tumoral and normal regions with TBR varying from 0.84 to 1.06 between these two time points. In the glioblastoma (GBM) model, the average TBRs were from 2.14 to 1.01 for [(18)F]FDB and from 0.95 to 1.65 for [(18)F]FDG. Therefore, inter-model comparisons showed significantly divergent responses (p < 0.01) of [(18)F]FDB between lymphoma and GBM, while [(18)F]FDG demonstrated overlap (p = 0.04) between the groups. Tumor characterization with histology (based mainly on Hoechst and CD79), as well as with MRI was overall in better agreement with [(18)F]FDB-PET than [(18)F]FDG with regard to tumor selectivity. Conclusions: [(18)F]FDB-PET demonstrated considerably greater specificity for CNSL when compared to [(18)F]FDG. It also permitted a more precise definition of target volume compared to contrast-enhanced MRI. Therefore, the potential of [(18)F]FDB-PET to distinguish CNSL from GBM is quite evident and will be further investigated in humans.

Title: Imaging biomarkers guided anti-angiogenic therapy for malignant gliomas.
Abstract: Antiangiogenic therapy is a universal approach to the treatment of malignant gliomas but fails to prolong the overall survival of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma patients. Imaging biomarkers are quantitative imaging parameters capable of objectively describing biological processes, pathological changes and treatment responses in some situations and have been utilized for outcome predictions of malignant gliomas in anti-angiogenic therapy. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques (including perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging), positron emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are imaging techniques that can be used to acquire imaging biomarkers, including the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), K(trans), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Imaging indicators for a better prognosis when treating malignant gliomas with antiangiogenic therapy include the following: a lower pre- or post-treatment rCBV, less change in rCBV during treatment, a lower pre-treatment K(trans), a higher vascular normalization index during treatment, less change in arterio-venous overlap during treatment, lower pre-treatment ADC values for the lower peak, smaller ADC volume changes during treatment, and metabolic changes in glucose and phenylalanine. The investigation and utilization of these imaging markers may confront challenges, but may also promote further development of anti-angiogenic therapy. Despite considerable evidence, future prospective studies are critically needed to consolidate the current data and identify novel biomarkers.

Title: PET imaging of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, as compared with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, in experimental rodent models of engrafted glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracers triggering alphavbeta3 integrins, such as certain RGD-containing peptides, were found promising in previous pilot studies characterizing high-grade gliomas. However, only limited comparisons have been performed with current PET tracers. This study aimed at comparing the biodistribution of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) with that of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, an easily synthesized monomeric RGD compound with rapid kinetics, in two different rodent models of engrafted human glioblastoma. METHODS: Nude rodents bearing human U87-MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in the flank (34 tumors in mice) or in the brain (5 tumors in rats) were analyzed. Kinetics of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD and of (18)F-FDG were compared with PET imaging in the same animals, along with additional autohistoradiographic analyses and blocking tests for (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD. RESULTS: Both tracers showed a primary renal route of clearance, although with faster clearance for (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD resulting in higher activities in the kidneys and bladder. The tumor activity from (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, likely corresponding to true integrin binding (i.e., suppressed by co-injection of a saturating excess of unlabeled RGD), was found relatively high, but only at the 2(nd) hour following injection, corresponding on average to 53% of total tumor activity. Tumor uptake of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD decreased progressively with time, contrary to that of (18)F-FDG, although (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD exhibited 3.4 and 3.7-fold higher tumor-to-normal brain ratios on average compared to (18)F-FDG in mice and rat models, respectively. Finally, ex-vivo analyses revealed that the tumor areas with high (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD uptake also exhibited the highest rates of cell proliferation and alphav integrin expression, irrespective of cell density. CONCLUSIONS: (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD has a high potential for PET imaging of glioblastomas, especially for areas with high integrin expression and cell proliferation, although PET recording needs to be delayed until the 2(nd) hour following injection in order to provide sufficiently high integrin specificity.

Title: (18)F-FDG PET/CT in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma: Differentiation from glioblastoma and correlation with DWI.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is useful for the detection of cancerous lesions, and FDG uptake is related to the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of extracranial tumors. The purpose of our study was to investigate the ability of FDG PET/CT in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and to explore the relationship between (18)F-FDG uptake and the ADC in patients with PCNSL. METHODS: We reviewed 92 patients (40 with PCNSL and 52 with GBM) who underwent FDG PET/CT scans at disease onset. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor to normal contralateral cortex activity (T/N) ratio, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of tumor lesions were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic performance for FDG PET-related parameters to differentiate PCNSL from GBM. Twenty-eight patients with PCNSL (with 34 lesions) also underwent diffusion-weighted imaging. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to assess the relation between SUV- and ADC-derived parameters. RESULTS: The SUVmax, T/N ratio, SUVmean, and TLG values were significantly higher in PCNSL than in GBM. Comparative ROC analysis indicated that the SUVmax had a greater area under the curve (AUC) of 0.910 than the T/N ratio (0.905, P = .85), SUVmean (0.836, P = .0006), or TLG (0.641, P < 0.0001). The T/N ratio had the highest specificity (94.23%) for differentiating PCNSL from GBM, while the SUVmax had the most optimal sensitivity (92.31%). Further combined analysis of the indices did not significantly improve the AUC. Moderate inverse correlations between the SUVmax, SUVmean, TLG, and the ADC ratio (rADC) were found in PCNSLs (r = -0.526, P = .002; r = -0.504, P = .004; and r = -0.483, P = .006; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The SUVmax and T/N ratio may be reliable measures for differentiating PCNSLs from GBMs. Additionally, FDG metabolism indices were inversely proportional to the rADCs of PCNSL lesions.

Title: Influence of region-of-interest designs on quantitative measurement of multimodal imaging of MR non-enhancing gliomas.
Abstract: A number of studies have revealed the usefulness of multimodal imaging in gliomas. Although the results have been heavily affected by the method used for region of interest (ROI) design, the most discriminatory method for setting the ROI remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the most suitable ROI design for (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the viewpoint of grades of non-enhancing gliomas. A total of 31 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed magnetic resonance (MR) non-enhancing gliomas who underwent FDG-PET, MET-PET and DTI were retrospectively investigated. Quantitative measurements were performed using four different ROIs; hotspot/tumor center and whole tumor, constructed in either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). Histopathological grading of the tumor was considered as empirical truth and the quantitative measurements obtained from each ROI was correlated with the grade of the tumor. The most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the different imaging modalities. 2D-hotspot/center ROI was most discriminating for FDG-PET (P=0.087), ADC map (P=0.0083), and FA map (P=0.25), whereas 3D-whole tumor ROI was best for MET-PET (P=0.0050). In the majority of scenarios, 2D-ROIs performed better than 3D-ROIs. Results from the image analysis using FDG-PET, MET-PET, ADC and FA may be affected by ROI design and the most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the imaging modality.

Title: A surgical strategy using a fusion image constructed from 11C-methionine PET, 18F-FDG-PET and MRI for glioma with no or minimum contrast enhancement.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of 11C-methionine (MET) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the hyperintense area in T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) in glioma with no or poor gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI). Cases were also analyzed pathologically. We prospectively investigated 16 patients with non- or minimally enhancing (< 10% volume) glioma. All patients underwent MET-PET and FDG-PET scans preoperatively. After delineating the tumor based on MET uptake, integrated 3D images from FDG-PET and MRI (GdMRI, T2WI or FLAIR) were generated and the final resection plane was planned. This resection plane was determined intraoperatively using the navigation-guided fencepost method. The delineation obtained by MET-PET imaging was larger than that with GdMRI in all cases with an enhanced effect. In contrast, the T2WI-abnormal signal area (T2WI+) tended to be larger than the MET uptake area (MET+). Tumor resection was > 95% in the non-eloquent area in 4/5 cases (80%), whereas 10 of 11 cases (90.9%) had partial resection in the eloquent area. In a case including the language area, 92% resection was achieved based on the MET-uptake area, in contrast to T2WI-based partial resection (65%), because the T2WI+/MET- area defined the language area. Pathological findings showed that the T2WI+/MET+ area is glioma, whereas 6 of 9 T2WI+/MET- lesions included normal tissues. Tissue from T2W1+/MET+/FDG+/GdMRI+ lesions gave an accurate diagnosis of grade in six cases. Non- or minimally enhancing gliomas were classified as having a MET uptake area that totally or partially overlapped with the T2WI hyperintense area. Resection planning with or without a metabolically active area in non- or minimally enhancing gliomas may be useful for accurate diagnosis, malignancy grading, and particularly for eloquent area although further study is needed to analyze the T2WI+/MET- area.

Title: In Vivo PET Assay of Tumor Glutamine Flux and Metabolism: In-Human Trial of (18)F-(2S,4R)-4-Fluoroglutamine.
Abstract: Purpose To assess the clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor imaging characteristics of fluorine 18-(2S,4R)-4-fluoroglutamine (FGln), a glutamine analog radiologic imaging agent. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Investigational New Drug application in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. All patients provided written informed consent. Between January 2013 and October 2016, 25 adult patients with cancer received an intravenous bolus of FGln tracer (mean, 244 MBq +/- 118, <100 mug) followed by positron emission tomography (PET) and blood radioassays. Patient data were summarized with descriptive statistics. FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels in nonfasting patients (n = 13) were compared with those from patients who fasted at least 8 hours before injection (n = 12) by using nonparametric one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Tumor FGln avidity versus fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in patients with paired PET scans (n = 15) was evaluated with the Fisher exact test. P < .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference. Results FGln PET depicted tumors of different cancer types (breast, pancreas, renal, neuroendocrine, lung, colon, lymphoma, bile duct, or glioma) in 17 of the 25 patients, predominantly clinically aggressive tumors with genetic mutations implicated in abnormal glutamine metabolism. Acute fasting had no significant effect on FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels. FGln-avid tumors were uniformly FDG-avid but not vice versa (P = .07). Patients experienced no adverse effects. Conclusion Preliminary human FGln PET trial results provide clinical validation of abnormal glutamine metabolism as a potential tumor biomarker for targeted radiotracer imaging in several different cancer types.

Title: Diagnostic and Prognostic Significance of Methionine Uptake and Methionine Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in Gliomas.
Abstract: The present most common image diagnostic tracer in clinical practice for glioma is (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for brain tumors diagnosis and prognosis. PET is a promising molecular imaging technique, which provides real-time information on the metabolic behavior of the tracer. The diffusive nature of glioblastoma (GBM) and heterogeneity often make the radiographic detection by FDG-PET inaccurate, and there is no gold standard. FDG-PET often leads to several controversies in making clinical decisions due to their uptake by normal surrounding tissues, and pose a challenge in delineating treatment-induced necrosis, edema, inflammation, and pseudoprogression. Thus, it is imperative to find new criteria independent of conventional morphological diagnosis to demarcate normal and tumor tissues. We have provided proof of concept studies for (11)C methionine-PET (MET-PET) imaging of gliomas, along with prognostic and diagnostic significance. MET-PET is not widely used in the United States, though clinical trials from Japan and Germany suggesting the diagnostic ability of MET-PET imaging are superior to FDG-PET imaging for brain tumors. A major impediment is the availability of the onsite cyclotron and isotopic carbon chemistry facilities. In this article, we have provided the scientific rationale and advantages of the use of MET-PET as GBM tracers. We extend our discussion on the expected pitfalls of using MET-PET and ways to overcome them by incorporating a translational component of profiling gene status in the methionine metabolic pathway. This translational correlative component to the MET-PET clinical trials can lead to a better understanding of the existing controversies and can enhance our knowledge for future randomization of GBM patients based on their tumor gene signatures to achieve better prognosis and treatment outcome.

Title: Usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography in Comparison with Methionine-Positron Emission Tomography in Differentiating Solid Hemangioblastoma from Adult Cerebellar Tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among adults with posterior fossa tumors, an intraaxial location of the tumor is less common than an extraaxial location. Moreover, the differential diagnosis of a single cerebellar tumor in adults is sometimes difficult by conventional magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed to report the findings of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and methionine in adult patients with intraaxial and solitary metastatic brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FDG-PET was performed on 12 patients with posterior fossa tumors: 4 had solid hemangioblastoma (HB), 3 had primary central nervous system lymphomas, 1 had a glioblastoma, and 4 had single metastatic brain tumors (METs). Methionine-PET was performed on 9 patients except for 1 patient with a MET. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumor was measured and compared with pathologic findings. RESULTS: The SUVmax of FDG in HB was lower compared with that of other tumors (P = 0.001). On the other hand, the SUVmax of methionine in the HB cases was almost the same as that in other tumors (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET was helpful in differentiating HBs from adult cerebellar tumors.

Title: Seizure semiology in leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 antibody-associated limbic encephalitis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to advance the characterization of seizure semiology in leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) antibody-associated limbic encephalitis (LE). METHODS: Eighteen patients diagnosed with LGI1 LE were identified. Seizure semiology, demographic features, MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), electroencephalograms, and outcomes following immunotherapy were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were divided into the following groups based on seizure semiology: faciobrachial dystonic seizure only (FBDS-only, n=4), epileptic seizure without FBDS (Non-FBDS, n=6), and FBDS plus epileptic seizure (FBDS+, n=8). In the group with Non-FBDS, the majority of patients (5/6) manifested mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) like semiology (i.e., fear, epigastric rising, staring, and automatisms) with a frequency of 7+/-5 times per day and a duration of 15.3+/-14.3s. In the group with FBDS+, the distinctive symptom was FBDS followed by epileptic events, especially automatisms (7/8), with a frequency of 16+/-12 times per day and a duration of 13.0+/-8.0s. In these cases, 67% and 50% of the patients showed abnormalities on MRI and FDG-PET, respectively, and the mesial temporal lobe structures were most often involved. Ictal discharges were observed in 0/4, 6/6, and 8/8 of the patients in the groups with FBDS only, Non-FBDS, and FBDS+, respectively. The temporal lobe was mainly affected. Immunotherapy had favorable therapeutic effects. SIGNIFICANCE: The LGI1 LE should be considered as one disease syndrome with a series of clinical manifestation. Identifying types of unique semiology features will facilitate the early diagnosis and the timely initiation of immunotherapy.

Title: Common malignant brain tumors: can 18F-FDG PET/CT aid in differentiation?
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evalute the metabolic characteristics of common malignant space-occupying lesions (SOL) of the brain and to determine the utility of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/CT in differentiating between the common types of malignant brain SOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with brain SOL who were referred for an F-FDG PET/CT scan by a multidisciplinary team were included in this retrospective study. The metabolic characteristics of the brain lesions in the form of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) along with tumor-to-background activity ratios were determined and differences were compared using nonparametric statistical tests. Histopathological confirmation was used as the gold standard in all patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to find the optimal SUVmax cutoff to differentiate the tumor types. RESULTS: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; n=30), lymphoma (n=25), and metastases (n=46) accounted for most malignant tumors (95.2%). Lymphomas showed a significantly high metabolic uptake (median SUVmax=20.3, range: 8.1-46.3) compared with GBM ( median SUVmax=10.3, range: 2.6-21.7) and metastases (median SUVmax=11.5, range: 2.9-19.6) (P=0.00). The tumor-to-background activity ratios for lymphomas were also significantly higher. There was an overlap in the metabolic uptake of GBM and metastases, with no significant difference between their SUVmax values (P=0.245). A SUVmax more than 15.5 showed an 84% sensitivity and an 80% specificity to diagnose lymphomas (area under the curve=0.876, P=0.00). Four patients with brain lymphoma had extracranial disease on F-FDG PET. Lung cancer was the most common primary malignancy in patients with brain metastases. CONCLUSION: Central nervous system lymphomas can be differentiated from GBM and metastases by their higher metabolic activity. In addition, F-FDG PET/CT can potentially impact therapeutic decisions by detecting primary malignancy in patients with metastatic brain lesions and extracranial disease sites in patients with brain lymphoma.

Title: MRI combined with PET-CT of different tracers to improve the accuracy of glioma diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: Based on studies focusing on positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of glioma, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the pros and cons and the accuracy of different examinations. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched. The search was conducted until April 2017. Two reviewers independently conducted the literature search according to the criteria set initially. Based on the exclusion criteria, 15 articles are included in this study. Of all studies that used MRI examination, there are five involving 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, five involving 11C-methionine-PET, five involving 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine-PET, and three involving 18F-fluorothymidine-PET. Due to the limitations such as lack of data, small sample size, and unrepresentative studies, we use a non-quantitative methodology. MRI examination can provide the anatomy information of glioma more clearly. PET-CT examinations based on tumor metabolism using different tracers have more advantages in determining the degree of glioma malignancy and boundaries. However, information provided by PET-CT of different tracers is not the same. With respect to the novel hybrid MRI/PET examination equipment proposed in recent years, the combination of MRI and PET-CT can definitively improve the diagnostic accuracy of glioma.

Title: Multiparametric MRI and [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Is a Potential Prognostic Imaging Biomarker in Recurrent Glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Multiparametric advanced MR and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may be important biomarkers for prognosis as well for distinguishing recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from treatment-related changes. METHODS/MATERIALS: We retrospectively evaluated 30 patients treated with chemoradiation for GBM and underwent advanced MR and FDG-PET for confirmation of tumor progression. Multiparametric MRI and FDG-PET imaging metrics were evaluated for their association with 6-month overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) based on pathological, radiographic, and clinical criteria. RESULTS: 17 males and 13 females were treated between 2001 and 2014, and later underwent FDG-PET at suspected recurrence. Baseline FDG-PET and MRI imaging was obtained at a median of 7.5 months [interquartile range (IQR) 3.7-12.4] following completion of chemoradiation. Median follow-up after FDG-PET imaging was 10 months (IQR 7.2-13.0). Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis identified that lesions characterized by a ratio of the SUV(max) to the normal contralateral brain (SUV(max)/NB index) >1.5 and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of </=1,400 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s correlated with worse 6-month OS and PFS. We defined three patient groups that predicted the probability of tumor progression: SUV(max)/NB index >1.5 and ADC </=1,400 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s defined high-risk patients (n = 7), SUV(max)/NB index </=1.5 and ADC >1,400 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s defined low-risk patients (n = 11), and intermediate-risk (n = 12) defined the remainder of the patients. Median OS following the time of the FDG-PET scan for the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups were 23.5, 10.5, and 3.8 months (p < 0.01). Median PFS were 10.0, 4.4, and 1.9 months (p = 0.03). Rates of progression at 6-months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups were 36, 67, and 86% (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Recurrent GBM in the molecular era is associated with highly variable outcomes. Multiparametric MR and FDG-PET biomarkers may provide a clinically relevant, non-invasive and cost-effective method of predicting prognosis and improving clinical decision making in the treatment of patients with suspected tumor recurrence.

Title: Extracranial bone metastases from recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma on FDG PET/CT: A case report a care-compliant article.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Extracranial bone metastases from astrocytoma are rare and frequently detected as part of multiorgan metastases. It is extremely rare for astrocytoma to have extracranial bone metastases alone. The importance of whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) imaging in evaluating extracranial metastasis (ECMs) has not been described effectively due to the rarity of this event. The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of FDG PET/CT in the assessment of tumor recurrence and extracranial bone metastases from anaplastic astrocytoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 25-year-old woman was firstly admitted with a 4-month history of progressive blurred vision, and 2-month history of intermittent headache. Presurgical MRI imaging revealed a large mass in the left trigone of lateral ventricle. Subsequently, she underwent tumor resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A final pathological diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO III) was made. Nearly 12 months after the surgery, the follow-up brain MR imaging revealed a contrast-enhanced lesion in the site of operative region. Whole-body FDG PET/CT imaging was performed to evaluate the situation. RESULTS: Postoperative brain FDG PET/CT showed an abnormal focal FDG uptake corresponding to the contrast-enhanced lesion in the operative area, suggesting a tumor recurrence. Whole-body FDG PET/CT also showed multiple FDG-avid osteosclerotic lesions in the body. It was highly suggestive of extracranial bone metastases. A subsequent open bone biopsy of FDG-avid lesion in right iliac crest was performed. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings indicated characteristic of glioma. The patient died 1 month later, nearly 13 months after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: ECMs from anaplastic astrocytoma are extremely rare but they do occur. Whole-body FDG PET/CT imaging with inclusion of brain was valuable in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis and in detecting uncommon extracranial bone metastases from anaplastic astrocytoma, which were closely related to prognosis of this disease.

Title: Clinical value of fluorine-18alpha-methyltyrosine PET in patients with gliomas: comparison with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between metabolic activity and histological features of gliomas using fluorine-18alpha-methyltyrosine ((18)F-FAMT) positron emission tomography (PET) compared with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET in 38 consecutive glioma patients. The tumor to normal brain ratios (T/N ratios) were calculated, and the relationships between T/N ratio and World Health Organization tumor grade or MIB-1 labeling index were evaluated. The diagnostic values of T/N ratios were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to differentiate between high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). RESULTS: Median T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was 2.85, 4.65, and 4.09 for grade II, III, and IV gliomas, respectively, with significant differences between HGGs and LGGs (p = 0.006). Both T/N ratio (p = 0.016) and maximum standardized uptake value (p = 0.033) of (18)F-FDG PET showed significant differences between HGGs and LGGs. ROC analysis yielded an optimal cut-off of 3.37 for the T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET to differentiate between HGGs and LGGs (sensitivity 81%, specificity 67%, accuracy 76%, area under the ROC curve 0.776). Positive predictive value was 84%, and negative predictive value was 62%. T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was not correlated with MIB-1 labeling index in all gliomas, whereas T/N ratio of (18)F-FDG PET was positively correlated (r (s)  = 0.400, p = 0.013). Significant positive correlation was observed between T/N ratios of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FAMT (r (s)  = 0.454, p = 0.004), but median T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was significantly higher than that of (18)F-FDG PET in all grades of glioma. CONCLUSIONS: The T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT uptake has high positive predictive value for detection of HGGs. (18)F-FAMT PET had higher T/N ratio, with better tumor-normal brain contrast, compared to (18)F-FDG PET in both LGGs and HGGs. Therefore, (18)F-FAMT is a useful radiotracer for the preoperative visualization of gliomas.

Title: Clinical Utility of Positron Emission Tomography in Patients with Malignant Glioma.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is being increasingly utilized for the management of brain tumors. Herein, we primarily review our previous studies on the use of PET in glioma that utilize three types of tracers: (11)C-methionine (MET), (11)C-choline, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose. These studies included aspects such as tumor behavior, diagnosis, grade of malignancy, spread and invasion, viability, and genetic deletions; moreover, they also evaluated PET as a tool for planning radiation therapy (RT) and determining its outcome. MET-PET in particular is considered to be the most informative for diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for glioma patients; it is therefore considered crucial for brain tumor therapy. MET-PET is expected to be widely used for brain tumor patients going forward.

Title: Reducing radiation dose to normal brain through a risk adapted dose reduction protocol for patients with favourable subtype anaplastic glioma.
Abstract: AIM: In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated anaplastic glioma determine the dosimetric benefits of delivering radiation therapy using a PET guided integrated boost IMRT technique (ib-IMRT) compared with standard IMRT (s-IMRT) in reducing dose to normal brain. METHODS: Ten patients with anaplastic glioma, identified as a favourable molecular subgroup through presence of IDH mutation, and managed with radiation therapy using an ib-IMRT were enrolled into a dosimetric study comparing two RT techniques: s-IMRT to 59.4Gy or ib-IMRT with 59.4/54Gy regions. Gross Tumour volume (GTV) and Clinical Target Volumes (CTV) were determined by MRI, 18F-Fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. A standard risk Planning Target Volume (PTVsr) receiving 59.4Gy (PTV59.4) in the s-IMRT technique was determined by MRI T2Flair and FET PET. For the ib-IMRT technique this PTVsr volume was treated to 54Gy, and the high-risk PTV (PTVhr) receiving 59.4Gy was determined as a higher risk region by FDG PET and MRI gadolinium enhancement. Standard dosimetric criteria and normal tissue constraints based on recent clinical trials were used in target delineation and planning. Normal Brain was defined as Brain minus CTV. Endpoints for dosimetric evaluation related to mean Brain dose (mBrainDose), brain volume receiving 40Gy (Brainv40) and 20Gy (Brainv20). The variation between the dosimetric endpoints for both techniques was examined using Wilcoxon analysis. RESULTS: The 10 patients had tumours located in temporal (1), parietal (3), occipital (2) and bifrontal (4) regions. In ib-IMRT technique the median volume of PTVhr was 25.5 cm3 compared with PTVsr of 300.0 cm3. For dose to PTVhr the two treatments were equivalent (p = 0.33), and although the ibIMRT had a prescribed 10% dose reduction from 59.4Gy to 54Gy the median reduction was only 5.9%. The ib-IMRT dosimetry was significantly improved in normal brain endpoints specifically mBrainDose (p = 0.007), Brainv40 (p = 0.005) and Brainv20 (p = 0.001), with a median reduction of 9.3%, 19.0 and 10.8% respectively. After a median follow-up of 38 months two patients have progressed, with no isolated relapse in the dose reduction region. CONCLUSION: An approach using ib-IMRT for anaplastic glioma produces significant dosimetric advantages in relation to normal brain dose compared with s-IMRT plan. This is achieved without a significant reduction to the target volume dose despite the reduction in prescribed dose. This technique has advantages to minimise potential late neurocognitive effects from high dose radiation in patients with favorable subtype anaplastic glioma with predicted median survival beyond ten years.

Title: FDG PET/MR Imaging Coregistration Helps Predict Survival in Patients with Glioblastoma and Radiologic Progression after Standard of Care Treatment.
Abstract: Purpose To determine the correlation between metabolic activity at fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and survival in patients with glioblastoma and suspected progression at posttherapy magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods The authors retrospectively examined the relationship between metabolic activity at FDG PET in the residual lesion identified at brain MR imaging and survival time in 56 patients with glioblastoma who were treated with postoperative concurrent radiation and temozolomide therapy and who underwent FDG PET/computed tomography because of radiologic deterioration at follow-up MR imaging between 2006 and 2015. A normalized metric of metabolic activity in the residual lesion (standardized uptake value ratio [SUV(r)]) was calculated as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) in the tumor relative to that in healthy white matter. The primary end point of the study was survival time from PET. Patients were stratified according to SUV(r). Comparisons of risk for death between subgroups were made with the log-hazard ratio of the Cox proportional hazard model. Results There was a significant association between overall survival and SUV(r) in the residual lesion (P = .006), and a survival benefit was observed in patients with SUV(r) of less than 1.7, who had a median survival time of 23.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.7, 38.9), which was significantly longer than that in patients with an SUV(r) of 2.0 to less than 2.5 and those with an SUV(r) of at least 2.5, who had a median survival time of 10.1 (95% CI: 2.4, 15.9; P = .008) and 7.5 (95% CI: 3.9, 9.7; P < .001) months, respectively. Conclusion Patients with glioblastoma whose posttherapy MR images showed a residual lesion with high relative metabolic activity at FDG PET had a shorter survival time than did those with low activity at FDG PET.

Title: An automated voxel-based method for calculating the reference value for a brain tumour metabolic index using (18)F-FDG-PET and (11)C-methionine PET.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The tumour-to-normal ratio (T/N) is a representative index reflecting brain tumour activity by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine (MET) PET. We proposed a new automated method of calculating the normal reference value (N-value) for use as the denomination of T/N. This method uses voxel-based analysis of FDG- and MET-PET images. We compared the results of this method with those of the standard region-of-interest (ROI) method. METHODS: Data sets were obtained from 32 patients with newly diagnosed glioma and 13 patients with recurrent brain tumour. Our methods were as follows: (1) FDG-PET and MET-PET images were co-registered. (2) The areas where the FDG uptake was higher than a set threshold were selected. (3) For the corresponding areas of MET-PET images, mode and mean voxel values were calculated as tentative MET N-values. (4) Applying the same coordinates to FDG-PET, the voxel values were averaged and used as tentative FDG N-values. (5) The threshold of FDG-PET and whether to use the mode or the mean voxel values were computationally optimized using learning data sets. (6) Applying the optimal threshold and either the mode or mean, N-values of FDG and MET were finally determined. RESULTS: N-values determined by our automated method showed excellent agreement with those determined by a manual ROI method (ICC(2,1) > 0.78). These values were significantly correlated with mean manual N-values (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our new method shows sufficiently good agreement with the standard method and can provide a more objective metabolic index.

Title: Hypoxic glucose metabolism in glioblastoma as a potential prognostic factor.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Metabolic activity and hypoxia are both important factors characterizing tumor aggressiveness. Here, we used F-18 fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to define metabolically active hypoxic volume, and investigate its clinical significance in relation to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in glioblastoma patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Glioblastoma patients (n = 32) underwent FMISO PET, FDG PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgical intervention. FDG and FMISO PET images were coregistered with gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images. Volume of interest (VOI) of gross tumor volume (GTV) was manually created to enclose the entire gadolinium-positive areas. The FMISO tumor-to-normal region ratio (TNR) and FDG TNR were calculated in a voxel-by-voxel manner. For calculating TNR, standardized uptake value (SUV) was divided by averaged SUV of normal references. Contralateral frontal and parietal cortices were used as the reference region for FDG, whereas the cerebellar cortex was used as the reference region for FMISO. FDG-positive was defined as the FDG TNR >/=1.0, and FMISO-positive was defined as FMISO TNR >/=1.3. Hypoxia volume (HV) was defined as the volume of FMISO-positive and metabolic tumor volume in hypoxia (hMTV) was the volume of FMISO/FDG double-positive. The total lesion glycolysis in hypoxia (hTLG) was hMTV x FDG SUVmean. The extent of resection (EOR) involving cytoreduction surgery was volumetric change based on planimetry methods using MRI. These factors were tested for correlation with patient prognosis. RESULTS: All tumor lesions were FMISO-positive and FDG-positive. Univariate analysis indicated that hMTV, hTLG, and EOR were significantly correlated with PFS (p = 0.007, p = 0.04, and p = 0.01, respectively) and that hMTV, hTLG, and EOR were also significantly correlated with OS (p = 0.0028, p = 0.037, and p = 0.014, respectively). In contrast, none of FDG TNR, FMISO TNR, GTV, HV, patients' age, or Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) was significantly correlated with PSF or OS. The hMTV and hTLG were found to be independent factors affecting PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced hMTV and hTLG using FDG and FMISO PET to define metabolically active hypoxic volume. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that both hMTV and hTLG are significant predictors for PFS and OS in glioblastoma patients.

Title: Clinical PET/MR Imaging in Dementia and Neuro-Oncology.
Abstract: The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems allows simultaneous multimodality image acquisition of high technical quality. This technique is well suited for the brain, and particularly in dementia and neuro-oncology. In routine use combinations of well-established MRI sequences and PET tracers provide the most optimal and clinically valuable protocols. For dementia the [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has merit with a simultaneous four sequence MRI protocol of 20 min supported by supplementary statistical reading tools and quantitative measurements of the hippocampal volume. Clinical PET/MRI using [18F]-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) also abide to the expectations of the adaptive and versatile diagnostic tool necessary in neuro-oncology covering both simple 20 min protocols for routine treatment surveillance and complicated 90 min brain and spinal cord protocols in pediatric neuro-oncology under general anesthesia. The clinical value of adding advanced MRI sequences in multiparametric imaging setting, however, is still undocumented.

Title: Demonstration of DCE-MRI as an early pharmacodynamic biomarker of response to VEGF Trap in glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor characterized by the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines. A recent phase II clinical trial studied VEGF Trap in adult patients with temozolomide-resistant GBM. We sought to explore changes in [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in trial participants correlating these changes with disease response. FDG-PET and MRI images obtained before and after the first dose of VEGF Trap were spatially co-registered. Regions of interest on each image slice were combined to produce a volume of interest representative of the entire tumor. Percent and absolute changes in maximum FDG-avidity, mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), K(trans), and Ve were calculated per lesion. Among the 12 participants that underwent dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), there were large, statistically significant reductions in K(trans) and Ve (median difference = -41.8 %, p < 0.02 and -42.6 %, p < 0.04, respectively). In contrast, there were no significant reductions in ADC or FDG-PET SUVmax values. DCE-MRI is a useful measure of early pharmacodynamic effects of VEGF Trap on tumor vasculature. The absence of significant changes in FDG-PET and DW-MRI suggest that the early pharmacodynamic effects are specific to tumor perfusion and/or permeability and do not directly inhibit metabolism or induce cell death. DCE-MRI in conjunction with standard imaging may be promising for the identification of anti-angiogenic effects in this patient population with this therapeutic target. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between DCE-MRI response and clinical outcome.

Title: Kinetic Modeling and Graphical Analysis of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine (FCho), 18F-Fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the Fiscrimination between High-Grade Glioma and Radiation Necrosis in Rats.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Discrimination between glioblastoma (GB) and radiation necrosis (RN) post-irradiation remains challenging but has a large impact on further treatment and prognosis. In this study, the uptake mechanisms of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (18F-FET) and 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCho) positron emission tomography (PET) tracers were investigated in a F98 GB and RN rat model applying kinetic modeling (KM) and graphical analysis (GA) to clarify our previous results. METHODS: Dynamic 18F-FDG (GB n = 6 and RN n = 5), 18F-FET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) and 18F-FCho PET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) were acquired with continuous arterial blood sampling. Arterial input function (AIF) corrections, KM and GA were performed. RESULTS: The influx rate (Ki) of 18F-FDG uptake described by a 2-compartmental model (CM) or using Patlak GA, showed more trapping (k3) in GB (0.07 min-1) compared to RN (0.04 min-1) (p = 0.017). K1 of 18F-FET was significantly higher in GB (0.06 ml/ccm/min) compared to RN (0.02 ml/ccm/min), quantified using a 1-CM and Logan GA (p = 0.036). 18F-FCho was rapidly oxidized complicating data interpretation. Using a 1-CM and Logan GA no clear differences were found to discriminate GB from RN. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results we concluded that using KM and GA both 18F-FDG and 18F-FET were able to discriminate GB from RN. Using a 2-CM model more trapping of 18F-FDG was found in GB compared to RN. Secondly, the influx of 18F-FET was higher in GB compared to RN using a 1-CM model. Important correlations were found between SUV and kinetic or graphical measures for 18F-FDG and 18F-FET. 18F-FCho PET did not allow discrimination between GB and RN.

Title: The Added Prognostic Value of Metabolic Tumor Size on FDG-PET at First Suspected Recurrence of Glioblastoma Multiforme.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) face a dismal prognosis, with an average survival of 6-7 months after recurrence. There remains no consensus for managing these patients due to the heterogeneity of these tumors. Imaging may affect treatment decisions by helping to stratify patient prognosis. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the added utility of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) over magnetic resonance (MR) imaging metrics in predicting survival. METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients who underwent FDG-PET for first recurrence of GBM were included in this analysis. Tumor sizes, using cross products, and volumes on FDG-PET and MRI, maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, presence of satellite lesions, presence of multifocal lesions, and presence of bilateral tumor were considered as prognostic variables. Survival was assessed using Cox hazard and logistic regression models based on the time interval between the PET scan and the patient's date of death. RESULTS: Tumor volumes on FDG-PET (P = .046), tumor cross products on FDG-PET (P = .017), and tumor cross products on MRI (P = .031) were significant prognostic variables, adjusting for the extent of the initial resection. Enhancing tumor volume, tumor cross product on a T2-weighted MRI sequence, maximum SUV on FDG-PET, minimum ADC value, presence of satellites, multifocality, and bilaterality were not prognostic (P > .5). Prognostic accuracy of predicting short survival increased from 58% with tumor cross product on MRI alone to 74% after including tumor cross product from PET. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size on FDG-PET adds prognostic information to enhancing tumor size on MRI at first suspected recurrence of GBM.

Title: The use of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) as a pathway-specific biomarker with AZD8186, a PI3Kbeta/delta inhibitor.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway is frequently altered in human cancer and a promising therapeutic target. AZD8186 (AstraZeneca) is a PI3Kbeta/delta inhibitor, currently in phase 1 clinical trials. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) is often used as a biomarker for inhibitors targeting the PI3K axis because of the association of this pathway with glucose metabolism. In this study, we assessed if (18)F-FDG PET could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker to monitor PI3Kbeta inhibition by AZD8186, and hence have potential as a clinical biomarker of PI3Kbeta pathway activation, and for patient selection. (18)F-FDG PET scans were performed in nude mice bearing 786-0 renal, U87-MG glioma, and BT474C breast xenograft models. Mice were fasted prior to imaging and static (18)F-FDG PET imaging was performed. Tumour growth was monitored throughout each study, and at the end of the imaging procedure, tumours were taken and a full pharmacodynamic analysis performed. RESULTS: Results showed that in PTEN null tumour xenograft models, 786-0 and U87-MG, the PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 reduces (18)F-FDG uptake at a dose of 50 mg/kg, the same dose which causes tumour inhibition, while it has no impact in a PI3Kalpha mutant tumour xenograft BT474C. Consistent with the change in (18)F-FDG uptake, AZD8186 also modulated AKT and associated glucose pathway biomarkers in the PTEN null tumour xenografts but not in PTEN wild-type tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our pre-clinical studies support the use of (18)F-FDG PET imaging as a sensitive and non-invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker for use in clinical studies with AZD8186.

Title: A reactivity-based [(18)F]FDG probe for in vivo formaldehyde imaging using positron emission tomography.
Abstract: Formaldehyde (FA) is a reactive carbonyl species (RCS) that plays a broad spectrum of roles in epigenetics, toxicology, and progression of diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes to neurodegeneration, motivating the development of translatable technologies for FA imaging. Here we report formaldehyde-caged-[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-1 ([(18)F]FAC-FDG-1), an aza-Cope-based reactivity probe for in vivo FA imaging using positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]FAC-FDG-1 reacts selectively with FA over potentially competing analytes to generate [(18)F]FDG, allowing its FA-dependent uptake and retention in cell culture as well as in animal models. The relative uptake of [(18)F]FAC-FDG-1 was evaluated using FA-treated PC3 prostate cancer and U87-MG glioblastoma cells demonstrating a dose-dependent response to exogenously added FA. Moreover, [(18)F]FAC-FDG-1 is capable of FA detection in vivo using a PC3 tumor xenograft model. In addition to providing a unique tool for monitoring FA in living animals, these data establish a general approach for translatable detection of FA and other reactive biological analytes in vivo by exploiting the widely-available clinical [(18)F]FDG tracer as a masked aldehyde that can be caged by analyte-responsive triggers.

Title: [Molecular imaging in neurological diseases].
Abstract: In neurodegeneration and in neuro-oncology, the standard imaging procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), shows limited sensitivity and specificity. Molecular imaging with specific positron-emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracers allows various molecular targets and metabolic processes to be assessed and is thus a valuable adjunct to MRI. Two important examples are referred to here: amino acid transport for neuro-oncological issues, and the recently approved PET tracers for detecting amyloid depositions during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. This review discusses the clinical relevance and indications for the following nuclear medicine imaging procedures: amyloid PET, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and dopamine transporter (DaT)-SPECT for the diagnosis of dementia and the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, in addition to amino acid PET for the diagnosis of brain tumors and somatostatin receptor imaging in meningioma.

Title: A novel, integrated PET-guided MRS technique resulting in more accurate initial diagnosis of high-grade glioma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignant glioma in adults. Currently, the modality of choice for diagnosing brain tumor is high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which provides anatomic detail and localization. Studies have demonstrated, however, that MRI may have limited utility in delineating the full tumor extent precisely. Studies suggest that MR spectroscopy (MRS) can also be used to distinguish high-grade from low-grade gliomas. However, due to operator dependent variables and the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, the potential for error in diagnostic accuracy with MRS is a concern. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been shown to add additional information with respect to tumor grade, extent, and prognosis based on the premise of biochemical changes preceding anatomic changes. Combined PET/MRS is a technique that integrates information from PET in guiding the location for the most accurate metabolic characterization of a lesion via MRS. We describe a case of glioblastoma multiforme in which MRS was initially non-diagnostic for malignancy, but when MRS was repeated with PET guidance, demonstrated elevated choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratio in the right parietal mass consistent with a high-grade malignancy. Stereotactic biopsy, followed by PET image-guided resection, confirmed the diagnosis of grade IV GBM. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an integrated PET/MRS technique for the voxel placement of MRS. Our findings suggest that integrated PET/MRS may potentially improve diagnostic accuracy in high-grade gliomas.

Title: A comparison study of (11)C-methionine and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in evaluation of patients with recurrent brain tumors.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: (11)C-methonine ([(11)C]-MET) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a well-established technique for evaluation of tumor for diagnosis and treatment planning in neurooncology. [(11)C]-MET reflects amino acid transport and has been shown to be more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in stereotactic biopsy planning. This study compared fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and MET PET-CT in the detection of various brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four subjects of brain tumor treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy were subjected to [(18)F]-FDG, [(11)C]-MET, and MRI scan. The lesion was analyzed semiquantitatively using tumor to normal contralateral ratio. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery, stereotactic biopsy, clinical follow-up, MRI, or CT scans. RESULTS: Tumor recurrence was found in 5 out of 22 patients on [F-18] FDG scan while [(11)C]-MET was able to detect recurrence in 18 out of 22 patients in low-grade gliomas. Two of these patients were false positive for the presence of recurrence of tumor and later found to be harboring necrosis. Among oligodendroglioma, medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma out of 42 patients 39 were found to be concordant MET and FDG scans. On semiquantitative analysis, mean T/NT ratio was found to be 2.96 +/- 0.94 for lesions positive for recurrence of tumors and 1.18 +/- 0.74 for lesions negative for recurrence of tumor on [(11)C]-MET scan. While the ratio for FDG scan on semiquantitative analysis was found to be 2.05 +/- 1.04 for lesions positive for recurrence of tumors and 0.52 +/- 0.15 for lesions negative for recurrence of tumors. CONCLUSION: The study highlight that [(11)C]-MET is superior to [(18)F]-FDG PET scans to detect recurrence in low-grade glioma. A cut-off value of target to nontarget value of 1.47 is a useful parameter to distinguish benign from malignant lesion on an [(11)C]-MET Scan. Both [(18)F]-FDG and [(11)C]-MET scans were found to be useful in high-grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and medulloblastoma.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients, 17 with PCNSL and 33 with GBM, were retrospectively studied. From the 3 Tesla IVIM data, the perfusion fraction (f) and diffusion coefficient (D) were obtained. In addition, the maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max) ) was obtained from the FDG-PET data. Each of the three parameters was compared between PCNSL and GBM using Mann-Whitney U-test. The performance in discriminating between PCNSL and GBM was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics analysis and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values for the three parameters. RESULTS: The f(max) and D(min) values were significantly higher in GBM than in PCNSL (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, the SUV(max) value was significantly lower in GBM than in PCNSL (P < 0.0005). The AUC values for f(max) , D(min) , and SUV(max) were 0.756, 0.905, and 0.857, respectively. The combination of the f(max) and D(min) increased the diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.936) of f(max) (P < 0.05), but this value was not significantly different from the values for D(min) (P = 0.30). CONCLUSION: IVIM-MR imaging noninvasively provides useful quantitative information in distinguishing between PCNSL and GBM. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1256-1261.

Title: Radiosensitizing effect of irisquinone on glioma through the downregulation of HIF-1alpha evaluated by 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO PET/CT.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the radiosensitizing mechanism of irisquinone (IQ) and evaluate the utility of F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) and F-fluoromisonidazole (F-FMISO) PET/computed tomography (CT) in assessing the radiosensitizing effect of IQ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an in-vitro experiment, C6 rat glioma cells were treated with IQ, radiation, or both. The viability and radiosensitivity of C6 cells were detected using the MTT assay and clonogenic survival assay. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot. In an in-vivo experiment, C6 rat glioma cells were implanted into the right flank of rats and treated with IQ, radiation, both, or no treatment. F-FDG and F-FMISO PET/CT images were obtained before and after treatment. The expression of HIF-1alpha was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. RESULTS: In the in-vitro experiment, the results of the MTT assay showed that the half-inhibition concentration (IC50) of IQ for normoxic and hypoxic C6 tumor cells was 17.2 and 21.0 nmol/l, respectively. Clonogenic survival assay showed that IQ could improve the radiosensitivity of both normoxic and hypoxic C6 tumor cells. When the concentration of irradiation was 20% IC50 (4.2 nmol/l), the sensitive enhancement ratio of normoxic and hypoxic C6 tumor cells was 1.18 and 1.33, respectively. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1alpha decreased significantly when treated with IQ plus radiation compared with the other groups.In the in-vivo experiment, 24 or 48 h after different treatments, the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of F-FDG or F-FMISO uptake decreased in the radiation group and the IQ plus radiation group, whereas these values increased in the control and IQ groups. The SUVmax of F-FDG or F-FMISO uptake in IQ plus radiation group were lower than those of the radiation group (t=3.28, 2.62, P<0.05). However, there was no significant decrease in tumor volumes in the radiation group and the IQ plus radiation treatment group early after treatment.Immunohistochemistry staining showed that there were significant differences in the expression of HIF-1alpha in the four groups (F=87.1, P<0.01). The SUVmax of both F-FDG and F-FMISO uptake showed a significant correlation with the expression of HIF-1alpha. F-FMISO provided a higher correlation coefficient with HIF-1alpha than F-FDG (r=0.93, 0.82, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present experiments indicated that IQ enhanced the radiosensitivity of C6 rat glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. The primary mechanism of this radiosensitizing effect involves the downregulation of HIF-1alpha. F-FDG and F-FMISO PET/CT were sensitive and noninvasive for monitoring the early radiosensitizing effect of IQ. Meanwhile, F-FMISO PET/CT provided more information on the changes in tumor hypoxic status.

Title: Crossed Cerebellar Diaschisis: Three Case Reports Imaging Using a Tri-Modality PET/CT-MR System.
Abstract: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) describes a depression of oxidative metabolism glucose and blood flow in the cerebellum secondary to a supratentorial lesion in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. PET/MR has the potential to become a powerful tool for demonstrating and imaging intracranial lesions .We herein report 3 cases of CCD imaging using a tri-modality PET/CT-MR set-up for investigating the value of adding MRI rather than CT to PET in clinical routine.We describe 3 patients with CCD and neurological symptoms in conjunction with abnormal cerebral fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/CT-MR) manifestations including arterial spin-labeling (ASL) and T2-weighted images. In all, 18FDG-PET/CT detected positive FDG uptake in supratentorial lesions, and hypometabolism with atrophy in the contralateral cerebellum. More than that, hybrid PET/MRI provided a more accurate anatomic localization and ASL indicated disruption of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.Using pathology or long-term clinical follow-up to confirm the PET and ASL findings, the supratentorial lesions of the 3 patients were respectively diagnosed with cerebral infarction, recurrent glioma, and metastasis.The reports emphasize the signi&filig;cance of multimodality radiological examinations. Multimodality imaging contributes to proper diagnosis, management, and follow-up of supratentorial lesions with CCD.

Title: Radiological features of cerebellar glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PROPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of malignant primary central nervous system tumor in adults; however, the prevalence of GBM arising in the cerebellum is extremely low. This study aimed to demonstrate the radiological features of cerebellar GBMs, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and (11)C methionine (MET)-positron emission tomography (PET) findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed seven patients with cerebellar GBM (six men and one woman: mean age: 56 years, range: 18-73 years). We reviewed medical records and radiological data, including preoperative CT, MRI and PET. All patients underwent CT and MRI. DWI data were acquired in four patients. Three patients underwent FDG- and MET-PET examinations. All patients underwent total or subtotal tumor resection and received pathological diagnoses. RESULTS: Four patients had imaging findings consistent with GBM and received preoperative cerebellar GBM diagnoses. Two patients exhibited homogeneous patchy and nodular enhancement without necrosis on MRI, which resembled malignant lymphoma and metastasis. One case exhibited Lhermitte-Duclos disease-like parallel linear striations (i.e.,"tiger-striped" appearance). Although the imaging findings of these three patients were inconsistent with GBM, pathological diagnosis confirmed cerebellar GMB. CONCLUSIONS: Some evaluated cases of cerebellar GBM did not exhibit the common CT, MRI, and PET findings of supratentrial GBM, leading to considerable difficulty with preoperative differential diagnosis.

Title: Concurrent functional and metabolic assessment of brain tumors using hybrid PET/MR imaging.
Abstract: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using an integrated PET/MR system in tumor grading as well as in differentiating recurrent tumor from treatment-induced effects (TIE) in brain tumor patients. Twenty patients (Group A: treatment naive, 9 patients with 16 lesions; Group B: post-therapy, 11 patients with 18 lesions) underwent fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET/MR with PWI. Two blinded readers predicted low versus high-grade tumor (for Group A) and tumor recurrence versus TIE (for Group B) based solely on tumor rCBV (regional cerebral blood volume) and SUV (standardized uptake values). Tumor histopathology at resection was the reference standard. Using rCBV(mean) </= 1.74 as a cut-off, 100% sensitivity and 74% specificity were observed, whereas 75% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity were observed with SUV(mean) </= 4.0 as a cut-off to classify patients as test positive for low-grade tumors (Group A) and TIE (Group B). Diagnostic accuracy for detection of low-grade tumors was 90% using PWI and 40% using PET in Group A (p = 0.056); for detection of TIE in Group B, diagnostic accuracy was 94.1% using PWI and 55.6% using PET (p = 0.033). No significant correlation was demonstrated between rCBV parameters and SUV in Group A (mean values: p > 0.403), Group B (p > 0.06) and in the entire population (p > 0.07). Best overall sensitivity and specificity were obtained using rCBV(mean) </= 1.74 and SUV(mean) </= 4.0 cut-off values. PWI demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy in both groups. Poor correlation was observed between FDG and rCBV parameters.

Title: Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of 11C-Methionine PET for Nonenhancing Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive radiologic evaluation of glioma can facilitate correct diagnosis and detection of malignant transformation. Although positron-emission tomography is considered valuable in the care of patients with gliomas, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine have reportedly shown ambiguous results in terms of grading and prognostication. The present study compared the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of diffusion tensor imaging, FDG, and (11)C-methionine PET in nonenhancing gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed nonenhancing gliomas that underwent both FDG and (11)C-methionine PET were retrospectively investigated (23 grade II and 12 grade III gliomas). Apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of both FDG and (11)C-methionine PET were compared between grade II and III gliomas. Prognostic values of these parameters were also tested by using progression-free survival. RESULTS: Grade III gliomas showed significantly higher average tumor-to-normal tissue and maximum tumor2-to-normal tissue than grade II gliomas in (11)C-methionine (P = .013, P = .0017, respectively), but not in FDG-PET imaging. There was no significant difference in average ADC, minimum ADC, average fractional anisotropy, and maximum fractional anisotropy. (11)C-methionine PET maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 2.0 was most suitable for detecting grade III gliomas among nonenhancing gliomas (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 73.9%). Among patients not receiving any adjuvant therapy, median progression-free survival was 64.2 +/- 7.2 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of <2.0 for (11)C-methionine PET and 18.6 +/- 6.9 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of >2.0 (P = .0044). CONCLUSIONS: (11)C-methionine PET holds promise for World Health Organization grading and could offer a prognostic imaging biomarker for nonenhancing gliomas.

Title: Qualitative analysis of spinal intramedullary lesions using PET/CT.
Abstract: OBJECT Although the usefulness of PET for brain lesions has been established, few reports have examined the use of PET for spinal intramedullary lesions. This study investigated the diagnostic utility of PET/CT for spinal intramedullary lesions. METHODS l-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET)- or [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT was performed in 26 patients with spinal intramedullary lesions. The region of interest (ROI) within the spinal cord parenchyma was placed manually in the axial plane. Maximum pixel counts in the ROIs were normalized to the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) using subject body weight. For FDG-PET the SUV(max) was corrected for lean body mass (SUL(max)) to exclude any influence of the patient's body shape. Each SUV was analyzed based on histopathological results after surgery. The diagnostic validity of the SUV was further compared with the tumor proliferation index using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 index). RESULTS A total of 16 patients underwent both FDG-PET and MET-PET, and the remaining 10 patients underwent either FDG-PET or MET-PET. Pathological diagnoses included high-grade malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or anaplastic ependymoma in 5 patients; low-grade malignancy such as hemangioblastoma, diffuse astrocytoma, or ependymoma in 12 patients; and nonneoplastic lesion including cavernous malformation in 9 patients. Both FDG and MET accumulated significantly in high-grade malignancy, and the SUL(max) and SUV(max) correlated with the tumor proliferation index. Therapeutic response after chemotherapy or radiation in high-grade malignancy was well monitored. However, a significant difference in SUL(max) and SUV(max) for FDG-PET and MET-PET was not evident between low-grade malignancy and nonneoplastic lesions. CONCLUSIONS Spinal PET/CT using FDG or MET for spinal intramedullary lesions appears useful and practical, particularly for tumors with high-grade malignancy. Differentiation of tumors with low-grade malignancy from nonneoplastic lesions may still prove difficult. Further technological refinement, including the selection of radiotracer or analysis evaluation methods, is needed.

Title: Textural analysis of pre-therapeutic [18F]-FET-PET and its correlation with tumor grade and patient survival in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) is well established in the diagnostic work-up of malignant brain tumors. Analysis of FET-PET data using tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) has been shown to be highly valuable for the detection of viable hypermetabolic brain tumor tissue; however, it has not proven equally useful for tumor grading. Recently, textural features in 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET have been proposed as a method to quantify the heterogeneity of glucose metabolism in a variety of tumor entities. Herein we evaluate whether textural FET-PET features are of utility for grading and prognostication in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS: One hundred thirteen patients (70 men, 43 women) with histologically proven high-grade gliomas were included in this retrospective study. All patients received static FET-PET scans prior to first-line therapy. TBR (max and mean), volumetric parameters and textural parameters based on gray-level neighborhood difference matrices were derived from static FET-PET images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and discriminant function analyses were used to assess the value for tumor grading. Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were employed for analysis of progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: All FET-PET textural parameters showed the ability to differentiate between World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV tumors (p < 0.001; AUC 0.775). Further improvement in discriminatory power was possible through a combination of texture and metabolic tumor volume, classifying 85 % of tumors correctly (AUC 0.830). TBR and volumetric parameters alone were correlated with tumor grade, but showed lower AUC values (0.644 and 0.710, respectively). Furthermore, a correlation of FET-PET texture but not TBR was shown with patient PFS and OS, proving significant in multivariate analysis as well. Volumetric parameters were predictive for OS, but this correlation did not hold in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of uptake heterogeneity in pre-therapeutic FET-PET using textural features proved valuable for the (sub-)grading of high-grade glioma as well as prediction of tumor progression and patient survival, and showed improved performance compared to standard parameters such as TBR and tumor volume. Our results underscore the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity in the biology of high-grade glial cell tumors and may contribute to individual therapy planning in the future, although they must be confirmed in prospective studies before incorporation into clinical routine.

Title: Primary glioblastoma of the cerebellar vermis: A case report.
Abstract: Cerebellar glioblastoma is a rare adult tumor. The accurate diagnosis of cerebellar glioblastoma is important for establishing a suitable therapeutic schedule. However, it is occasionally difficult to diagnosis these tumors. Clinical presentation, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging can provide useful information, but they may not lead to a definitive diagnosis. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide a novel way of forming a differential diagnoses. The lesions of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) rarely occur in the cerebellum, with prior studies reporting that only 0.4-3.4% of all GBM tumors occur here. In the current study, a case of primary cerebellar glioblastoma is presented and the physiopathology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment and general outcome of this disease are discussed. A 61-year-old female presented with nausea, vomiting, balance problems and cerebellar signs. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination demonstrated one regular contour of a mass lesion in the cerebellar vermis. Following surgery, glioblastoma was histologically confirmed. The outcome of the patient was favorable after 18 months of follow-up. Cerebellar GBM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a cerebellar mass lesion, and PET/CT may provide a novel identification method for different cerebellar mass lesions.

Title: Glioblastoma Multiforme Recurrence: An Exploratory Study of (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/CT.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate fluorine 18 ((18)F) 2-fluoropropionyl-labeled PEGylated dimeric arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide (PEG3-E[cRGDyk]2) (FPPRGD2) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. (18)F FPPRGD2 uptake was measured semiquantitatively in the form of maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) and uptake volumes before and after treatment with bevacizumab. Vital signs and laboratory results were collected before, during, and after the examinations. A nonparametric version of multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess safety outcome measures simultaneously across time points. A paired two-sample t test was performed to compare SUV(max). RESULTS: A total of 17 participants (eight men, nine women; age range, 25-65 years) were enrolled prospectively. (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/computed tomography (CT), (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, and brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed within 3 weeks, prior to the start of bevacizumab therapy. In eight of the 17 patients (47%), (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/CT was repeated 1 week after the start of bevacizumab therapy; six patients (35%) underwent (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/CT a third time 6 weeks after starting bevacizumab therapy. There were no changes in vital signs, electrocardiographic findings, or laboratory values that qualified as adverse events. One patient (6%) had recurrent GBM identified only on (18)F FPPRGD2 PET images, and subsequent MR images enabled confirmation of recurrence. Of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) had recurrent GBM identified on (18)F FPPRGD2 PET and brain MR images, while (18)F FDG PET enabled identification of recurrence in 13 (76%) patients. Two patients (12%) had no recurrent GBM. CONCLUSION: (18)F FPPRGD2 is a safe PET radiopharmaceutical that has increased uptake in GBM lesions. Larger cohorts are required to confirm these preliminary findings.

Title: A meta-analysis comparing 18F-FLT PET with 18F-FDG PET for assessment of brain tumor recurrence.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET for the assessment of glioma recurrence and compare it with that of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET. METHODS: The authors electronically and manually searched for studies from 1948 to 2014 that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG or (18)F-FLT PET for glioma recurrence. The primary results of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were summarized using the random-effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and its area under the curve (AUC were used to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy. Statistical analysis was performed with the software STATA (version 11.0). RESULTS: Twenty-four studies that included a total of 799 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and summary ROC AUC for the overall diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET were 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.85), 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.85), 12 (95% CI 6-22), and 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.87), respectively. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and summary ROC AUC for the overall diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FLT PET were 0.82 (95% CI 0.51-0.95), 0.76 (95% CI 0.50-0.91), 15 (95% CI 4-56), and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), respectively. Metaregression analysis showed that year of publication, male proportion, average age, and blinding review did not affect the test performance statistically significantly (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that PET by using (18)F-FLT has a moderately better overall accuracy for diagnosing glioma recurrence compared with that by using (18)F-FDG.

Title: Glucose-corrected standardized uptake value in the differentiation of high-grade glioma versus post-treatment changes.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET ((18)F-FDG PET) are used widely to differentiate residual or recurrent high-grade gliomas from post-treatment changes in patients with brain tumors. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of SUV corrected by blood glucose level (SUV(gluc)) compared with various quantitative methods in this role. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 55 patients with dynamic F-FDG PET scans, there were 97 glioma lesions: glioblastoma (n=60), grade III gliomas (n=22), grade III or IV gliomas (n=6), grade I/II (n=7), and prebiopsy lesions (n=2). The final actual diagnosis was made on the basis of pathology (n=33) and clinical outcome (n=64). Dynamic F-FDG PET scans were processed to generate parametric images of SUV(gluc), SUV(max), and glucose metabolic rate (GMR). Lesion to cerebellum ratios (SUV(Rc)) and contralateral white matter ratios (SUV(Rw)) were also measured. The SUV(gluc) was calculated as SUV(max)xblood glucose level/100. RESULTS: Using the thresholds of SUV(max)>4.6, SUV(Rc)>0.9, SUV(Rw)>1.8, SUV(gluc)>4.3, and GMR>12.2 mumol/min/100 g to represent positivity for viable tumors, the accuracies were the same for the SUV(gluc) and SUV(Rw) (80%) and were higher than the conventional SUV(max) (72%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SUV(gluc) (0.8933) was better than that for the SUV(max) (0.8266) (P<0.01) and was similar to those of the GMR (0.8622), SUV(Rc) (0.8606), and SUV(Rw) (0.8981). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SUV(gluc) may aid in the differentiation of residual or recurrent high-grade tumor from post-treatment changes in patients with abnormal blood glucose levels. The simplicity of the SUV(gluc) avoids the complexity of kinetic analysis or the requirement of a reference tissue.

Title: Glutamine-based PET imaging facilitates enhanced metabolic evaluation of gliomas in vivo.
Abstract: Glucose and glutamine are the two principal nutrients that cancer cells use to proliferate and survive. Many cancers show altered glucose metabolism, which constitutes the basis for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG). However, (18)F-FDG is ineffective in evaluating gliomas because of high background uptake in the brain. Glutamine metabolism is also altered in many cancers, and we demonstrate that PET imaging in vivo with the glutamine analog 4-(18)F-(2S,4R)-fluoroglutamine ((18)F-FGln) shows high uptake in gliomas but low background brain uptake, facilitating clear tumor delineation. Chemo/radiation therapy reduced (18)F-FGln tumor avidity, corresponding with decreased tumor burden. (18)F-FGln uptake was not observed in animals with a permeable blood-brain barrier or neuroinflammation. We translated these findings to human subjects, where (18)F-FGln showed high tumor/background ratios with minimal uptake in the surrounding brain in human glioma patients with progressive disease. These data suggest that (18)F-FGln is avidly taken up by gliomas, can be used to assess metabolic nutrient uptake in gliomas in vivo, and may serve as a valuable tool in the clinical management of gliomas.

Title: Oligodendroglial component complicates the prediction of tumour grading with metabolic imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Previous radiological investigations have generally shown the superiority of metabolic imaging in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade glioma, but the presence of an oligodendroglial component may affect the diagnostic accuracy. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of PET imaging using (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade glioma, in correlation with the oligodendroglial component. METHODS: The study population comprised adult patients who underwent preoperative PET imaging using both MET and FDG within 1 week and successful excision of the tumour tissue, which confirmed WHO grade II-IV glioma. We examined the tumour metabolic activity in terms of lesion-to-normal uptake ratios (L/N ratio) in both MET PET and FDG PET images. We assessed the correlation between the imaging results and the histological findings to determine the diagnostic accuracy of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis in detecting high-grade tumours. RESULTS: We studied 46 patients with glioma (13 low-grade and 33 high-grade), including 26 with an oligodendroglial components. The L/N ratios of the PET images showed significantly higher metabolic activities in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas for both MET (4.29 +/- 1.22 and 2.36 +/- 0.72, respectively; p < 0.0001) and FDG (1.72 +/- 0.91 and 0.77 +/- 0.26, respectively; p = 0.0007) images, although significant overlaps in L/N ratio were observed between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. Excluding the 26 patents with an oligodendroglial component improved the separation for both MET (4.62 +/- 1.14 vs. 2.16 +/- 0.63; p < 0.001) and FDG (1.76 +/- 0.87 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.14; p < 0.05) images. The ROC analyses demonstrated the clinical utility of the metabolic radiotracers in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade gliomas, showing similar AUC values for MET (0.91) and FDG (0.92). Excluding the 26 patents with an oligodendroglial component also further improved the diagnostic accuracy for both MET (AUC 0.98), and FDG (AUC 1.00) images. The metabolic radiotracers were significantly correlated with the MIB-1 labelling index (R = 0.52, p < 0.05 for MET; R = 0.52, p < 0.05, for FDG) only in gliomas without an oligodendroglial component. CONCLUSION: For better characterization of gliomas and for risk assessment, the results of metabolic PET imaging should be revised after obtaining the pathological report, because oligodendroglial differentiation may positively influence the substrate metabolism and thus complicated the preoperative evaluation.

Title: (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (1)(1)C-methionine positron emission tomography in relation to methyl-guanine methyltransferase promoter methylation in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Methylation status of the methyl-guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter is associated with a favorable response to a DNA alkylating agent in high-grade gliomas. We analyzed PET scans of patients with high-grade gliomas to determine whether the MGMT methylation status affects the tumor metabolic characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with high-grade glioma, who were initially examined with 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, were retrospectively enrolled. MET and FDG PET images were coregistered to each other and quantitative uptake of MET or FDG was assessed using tumor-to-normal uptake ratio of the cortex (TNR). TNRs for MET and FDG PET were compared between the two groups classified by MGMT promoter methylation status. RESULTS: Maximum TNR(FDG) of the MGMT methylated group was significantly higher than that of the MGMT unmethylated group (1.80+/-0.90 vs. 1.29+/-0.19; P=0.02). The MGMT methylated group also showed a trend for increased mean TNRFDG compared with the unmethylated group (0.85+/-0.21 vs. 0.72+/-0.11; P=0.10). There was no significant difference in TNR(MET) between the groups. In subgroup analyses with WHO grade 3 and 4, a trend for higher maximum TNR(FDG) was found in the MGMT methylated group compared with the unmethylated group. CONCLUSION: The MGMT methylated group showed higher glucose metabolism compared with the unmethylated group, whereas MET uptake did not show a significant difference. This suggests that MGMT methylation in high-grade gliomas could affect the tumor glucose metabolism. Thus, MGMT methylation status can cause a discrepancy in the prognostic prediction of high-grade gliomas by FDG PET, especially in patients scheduled for DNA alkylating chemotherapeutics.

Title: (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (FCho), (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for the discrimination between high-grade glioma and radiation necrosis in rats: a PET study.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Discrimination between (high-grade) brain tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Metabolic imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. In this study, we investigated the potential of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG), O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET), and [(18)F]-Fluoromethyl-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium ((18)F-fluoromethylcholine, (18)F-FCho) PET in discriminating high-grade tumor from RN. METHODS: We developed a glioblastoma (GB) rat model by inoculating F98 GB cells into the right frontal region. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using three arcs with a beam aperture of 3x3 mm (n=3). Dynamic PET imaging with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FET, and (18)F-FCho, as well as (18)F-FDG PET at a delayed time interval (240 min postinjection), was acquired. RESULTS: MRI revealed contrast-enhancing tumors at 15 days after inoculation (n=4) and contrast-enhancing RN lesions 5-6 months postirradiation (n=3). On (18)F-FDG PET, the mean lesion-to-normal ratio (LNRmean) was significantly higher in GB than in RN (p=0.034). The difference in the LNRmean between tumors and RN was higher on the late (18)F-FDG PET images than on the PET images reconstructed from the last time frame of the dynamic acquisition (this is at a conventional time interval). LNRs obtained from (18)F-FCho PET were not significantly different between GB and RN (p=1.000). On (18)F-FET PET, the LNRmean was significantly higher in GB compared to RN (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike (18)F-FCho, (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FET PET were effective in discriminating GB from RN. Interestingly, in the case of (18)F-FDG, delayed PET seems particularly useful. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: Our results suggest that (delayed) (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FET PET can be used to discriminate GB (recurrence) from RN. Confirmation of these results in clinical studies is needed.

Title: Perfusion-metabolism coupling in recurrent gliomas: a prospective validation study with 13N-ammonia and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We assessed the validity of "perfusion-metabolism coupling" hypothesis in recurrent glioma with 13N-ammonia (13N-NH3) PET/CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (age, 38.8 +/- 12.1 years; 62.5% males) with histologically proven and previously treated glioma presenting with clinical suspicion of recurrence were prospectively enrolled and evaluated with 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT. PET/CT images were evaluated both qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Tumor to white matter uptake ratio (T/W) and tumor to gray matter uptake ratio (T/G) were calculated and analyzed for both the modalities. A combination of clinico-radiological follow-up, repeated imaging, and biopsy (when available) were considered as the reference standard. RESULTS: Based on the reference standard, 27/56 patients had recurrence. 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT were concordant in 55/56 patients. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 13N-NH3PET/CT were 77.8, 86.2, 84.0, 80.7, and 82.1%, respectively, and for 18F-FDG PET/CT were 77.8, 89.7, 87.5, 81.2, and 83.9%, respectively. There was excellent agreement between results of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (k = 0.964; P < 0.001). The performances of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT were not significantly different between high-grade and low-grade glioma (P = 1.000). A strong positive correlation was noted between the uptake ratios derived on the two modalities (rho = 0.866, P < 0.001 for T/W; rho = 0.918, P < 0.001 for T/G). CONCLUSION: A combination of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrates that perfusion and metabolism are coupled in recurrent gliomas. These tracers target two different but interrelated aspects of the same pathologic process and can be used as surrogates for each other.

Title: Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in detection of tumor recurrence in posttreatment of glioma: A diagnostic meta-analysis.
Abstract: It is important to distinguish between tumor recurrence and treatment effects in posttreatment patients with high-grade gliomas. Several imaging modalities have been reported in differentiating between tumor recurrence and treatment effects. However, there were no consistent conclusions between different studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 23 studies that compared the diagnostic values of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET (positron emission tomography) or PET/CT (computed tomography) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in predicting tumor recurrence of gliomas. The pooled estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and summary receiver operating characteristic curves of (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET or PET/CT and MRS in detecting tumor recurrence were calculated. In conclusion, MRS is highly sensitive in the detection of tumor recurrence in glioma.(18)F-FDG PET or PET/CT is highly specific in recurrence diagnosis. (11)C-MET does not have noticeable advantage over (18)F-FDG. The current evidence shows no statistical difference between MRS and PET on the accuracy.

Title: Applications of positron emission tomography in neuro-oncology: a clinical approach.
Abstract: The field of neuro-oncology is concerned with some of the most challenging and difficult to treat conditions in medicine. Despite modern therapies patients diagnosed with primary brain tumours often have a poor prognosis. Imaging can play an important role in evaluating the disease status of such patients. In addition to the structural information derived from MRI and CT scans, positron emission tomography (PET) provides important quantitative metabolic assessment of brain tumours. This review describes the use of PET with radiolabelled glucose and amino acid analogues to aid in the diagnosis of tumours, differentiate between recurrent tumour and radiation necrosis and guide biopsy or treatment. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the tracer that has been used most widely because it has a 2 h half life and can be transported to imaging centres remote from the cyclotron and radiochemistry facilities which synthesise the tracers. The high uptake of FDG in normal grey matter however limits its use in some low grade tumours which may not be visualised. [(11)C] methionine (MET) is an amino acid tracer with low accumulation in normal brain which can detect low grade gliomas, but its short 20 min half life has limited its use to imaging sites with their own cyclotron. The emergence of new fluorinated amino acid tracers like [(18)F]Fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) will likely increase the availability and utility of PET for patients with primary brain tumours. PET can, further, characterise brain tumours by investigating other metabolic processes such as DNA synthesis or thymidine kinase activity, phospholipid membrane biosynthesis, hypoxia, receptor binding and oxygen metabolism and blood flow, which will be important in the future assessment of targeted therapy.

Title: Optimization of the reference region method for dual pharmacokinetic modeling using Gd-DTPA/MRI and (18) F-FDG/PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The combination of MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) offers new possibilities for the development of novel methodologies. In pharmacokinetic image analysis, the blood concentration of the imaging compound as a function of time, [i.e., the arterial input function (AIF)] is required for MRI and PET. In this study, we tested whether an AIF extracted from a reference region (RR) in MRI can be used as a surrogate for the manually sampled (18) F-FDG AIF for pharmacokinetic modeling. METHODS: An MRI contrast agent, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and a radiotracer, (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG), were simultaneously injected in a F98 glioblastoma rat model. A correction to the RR AIF for Gd-DTPA is proposed to adequately represent the manually sampled AIF. A previously published conversion method was applied to convert this AIF into a (18) F-FDG AIF. RESULTS: The tumor metabolic rate of glucose (TMRGlc) calculated with the manually sampled (18) F-FDG AIF, the (18) F-FDG AIF converted from the RR AIF and the (18) F-FDG AIF converted from the corrected RR AIF were found not statistically different (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: An AIF derived from an RR in MRI can be accurately converted into a (18) F-FDG AIF and used in PET pharmacokinetic modeling.

Title: Relationship of computed tomography perfusion and positron emission tomography to tumour progression in malignant glioma.
Abstract: IntroductionThis study aimed to explore the potential for computed tomography (CT) perfusion and 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in predicting sites of future progressive tumour on a voxel-by-voxel basis after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. MethodsTen patients underwent pre-radiotherapy magnetic resonance (MR), FDG-PET and CT perfusion near the end of radiotherapy and repeated post-radiotherapy follow-up MR scans. The relationships between these images and tumour progression were assessed using logistic regression. Cross-validation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the value of these images in predicting sites of tumour progression. ResultsPre-radiotherapy MR-defined gross tumour; near-end-of-radiotherapy CT-defined enhancing lesion; CT perfusion blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV) and permeability-surface area (PS) product; FDG-PET standard uptake value (SUV); and SUV:BF showed significant associations with tumour progression on follow-up MR imaging (P < 0.0001). The mean sensitivity (+/-standard deviation), specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of PS were 0.64 +/- 0.15, 0.74 +/- 0.07 and 0.72 +/- 0.12 respectively. This mean AUC was higher than that of the pre-radiotherapy MR-defined gross tumour and near-end-of-radiotherapy CT-defined enhancing lesion (both AUCs = 0.6 +/- 0.1, P </= 0.03). The multivariate model using BF, BV, PS and SUV had a mean AUC of 0.8 +/- 0.1, but this was not significantly higher than the PS only model. ConclusionPS is the single best predictor of tumour progression when compared to other parameters, but voxel-based prediction based on logistic regression had modest sensitivity and specificity.

Title: 18 F-FDG PET standard uptake values of the normal pons in children: establishing a reference value for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) is a useful diagnostic and prediction tool in brain tumors, but its value in childhood diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is still unclear. For interpretation of 18 F-FDG PET results in DIPG, uptake values of the normal pons of children of increasing ages are mandatory. The aim of this study was to determine 18 F-FDG standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) of the normal pons and to compare these to those of DIPG. METHODS: We studied 36 subjects with a normal, non-affected pons (aged 5 to 23 years) and 6 patients with DIPG (aged 4 to 17 years) who underwent 18 F-FDG PET scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was co-registered to define the regions of interest. SUVr and SUVrmax for the pons/cerebellum (SUVrp/c) and the pons/occipital lobe (SUVrp/o) were calculated. Independent-samples t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the mean SUVr and Pearson's test for correlations. RESULTS: For the normal pons, mean SUVrp/c and SUVrp/o were 0.65 (+/-0.054) and 0.51 (+/-0.056), respectively. No significant correlations were found between the SUVr of the normal pons and sex, age, nor pontine volume. A modest but statistically significant correlation was found between SUVr and post-injection time acquisition timing. For DIPG, mean SUVrp/c and SUVrp/o were 0.74 (+/-0.20) and 0.65 (+/-0.30), respectively, while mean SUVrp(max)/c and SUVrp(max)/o were 1.95 (+/-0.48) and 1.81 (+/-0.20), respectively. CONCLUSION: The SUVr of the unaffected pons are strikingly constant between children, irrespective of sex and age, and can therefore be well used as a reference value for 18 F-FDG PET studies in DIPG.

Title: Comparison of (11)C-methionine, (11)C-choline, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET for distinguishing glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis.
Abstract: The aim of this study is to assess the different metabolic activities characteristic of glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis (RN) and to explore the diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of the two conditions using (11)C-methionine (MET), (11)C-choline (CHO), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). Fifty patients with lesions suggestive of recurrent glioma by MRI underwent MET, CHO, and FDG-PET. All patients who had previously been treated with radiotherapy for malignant glioma were subjected to open surgery and pathological diagnosis (17 recurrent grade 3- gliomas (Gr.3s) comprising 7 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and 10 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AOs), 17 recurrent glioblastomas (Gr.4s), and 16 RNs). We measured the PET/Gd volume ratio, the PET/Gd overlap ratio, and the lesion/normal brain uptake ratio (L/N ratio) and determined the optimal index of each PET scan. The PET/Gd volume ratio and the PET/Gd overlap ratio for RN were significantly lower than those of glioma recurrence only with MET-PET (P < 0.05). The L/N ratio of RN was significantly lower than that of Gr.4 with all PET imaging (P < 0.001) and was significantly lower than that of Gr.3, especially for AO, only with MET-PET images (P < 0.005). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the curve of MET, CHO, and FDG was 92.5, 81.4, and 77.4, respectively. MET L/N ratio of greater than 2.51 provided the best sensitivity and specificity for establishing glioma recurrence (91.2% and 87.5%, respectively). These results demonstrated that MET-PET was superior to both CHO and FDG-PET for diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing glioma recurrence from RN.

Title: Usefulness of FMISO-PET for glioma analysis.
Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common brain tumors in adults. Its diagnosis and management have been determined by histological classifications. It is difficult to establish new paradigms because the pathology has matured and a great deal of knowledge has accumulated. On the other hand, we understand that there are limitations to this gold-standard because of the heterogeneity of glioma. Thus, it is necessary to find new criteria independent of conventional morphological diagnosis. Molecular imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most promising approaches to this challenge. PET provides live information of metabolism through the behavior of single molecules. The advantage of PET is that its noninvasive analysis does not require tissue sample, therefore examination can be performed repeatedly. This is very useful for capturing changes in the biological nature of tumor without biopsy. In the present clinical practice for glioma, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is the most common tracer for predicting prognosis and differentiating other malignant brain tumors. Amino acid tracers such as (11)C-methionine (MET) are the most useful for detecting distribution of glioma, including low-grade. Tracers to image hypoxia are under investigation for potential clinical use, and recently, (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) has been suggested as an effective tracer to distinguish glioblastoma multiforme from others.

Title: [PET-MR in patients with glioblastoma multiforme].
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary tumor of the brain. In recent years newer therapeutic approaches have been developed. To allow for an optimized treatment planning it is important to precisely delineate necrotic tissue, edema and vital tumor tissue and to identify the most aggressive parts of the GBM. The magnetic resonance (MR) portion of an MR-positron emission tomography (PET) examination in patients with GBM should consist of both structural and functional sequences including diffusion-weighted and perfusion sequences. The use of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) is limited in patients with gliomas as glucose metabolism is already physiologically high in parts of the brain but (18)F-FDG is nevertheless a commonly used radiopharmaceutical for neuro-oncological questions. (18)F-fluorothymidine reflects the cellular activity of thymidine kinase 1 and correlates with the expression of KI-67 as an index of mitotic activity. The nitroimidazole derivatives (18)F-fluoromisonidazole and (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ((18)F-FAZA) allow the detection of hypoxic areas within the tumor. In recent years amino acid tracers, such as (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine are increasingly being used in the diagnosis of gliomas. The simultaneous PET-MR image acquisition allows new approaches, e.g. motion correction by the simultaneous acquisition of MR data with a high temporal resolution and an improved quantification of the PET signal by integrating the results of functional MR sequences. Moreover, the simultaneous acquisition of these two time-consuming methods leads to reduced imaging times for this, often severely ill patient group.

Title: (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis (N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) PET in human gliomas: comparative study with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose and L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) was developed as a hypoxic radiotracer in PET. We compared imaging features among MR imaging and (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone)-PET, FDG-PET, and L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine)-PET in gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 23 patients who underwent (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone)-PET and FDG-PET and 19 (82.6%) who underwent L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine)-PET, with all 23 patients undergoing surgery and their diagnosis being then confirmed by histologic examination as a glioma. Semiquantitative and volumetric analysis were used for the comparison. RESULTS: There were 10 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and 13 nonglioblastoma multiforme (grades II and III), including 4 recurrences without any adjuvant treatment. The maximum standardized uptake value and tumor/background ratios of (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone), as well as L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine, were significantly higher in glioblastoma multiforme than in nonglioblastoma multiforme (P = .03 and P = .03, respectively); no significant differences were observed on FDG. At a tumor/background ratio cutoff threshold of 1.9, (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) was most predictive of glioblastoma multiforme, with 90.0% sensitivity and 76.9% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values, respectively, for glioblastoma multiforme were 75.0% and 85.7% on (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone), 83.3% and 60.0% on L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine, and 72.7% and 75.0% on MR imaging. In glioblastoma multiforme, volumetric analysis demonstrated that (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) uptake had significant correlations with FDG (r = 0.68, P = .03) and L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine (r = 0.87, P = .03). However, the (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone)-active region was heterogeneously distributed in 50.0% (5/10) of FDG-active and 0% (0/6) of L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine)-active regions. CONCLUSIONS: (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) may be a practical radiotracer in the prediction of glioblastoma multiforme. In addition to FDG-PET, L-methyl-[(11)C]methionine)-PET, and MR imaging, (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone)-PET may provide intratumoral hypoxic information useful in establishing targeted therapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

Title: 18F-FDG PET in the diagnosis and treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Abstract: This paper summarizes the usefulness and limitation of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in the diagnosis and treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The (18)F-FDG uptake in typical PCNSL is about 2.5 times higher than that in the normal gray matter, and the tumor can usually be identified visually. The (18)F-FDG uptake pattern and value provide useful information for differentiating PCNSL from other enhancing malignant brain tumors especially glioblastoma (GB). The (18)F-FDG uptake in typical PCNSL is usually homogenous, and the uptake value is significantly higher than that in GB. However, (18)F-FDG PET often fails to show the presence of tumor in the brain as (18)F-FDG uptake is faint in atypical PCNSL such as disseminated or nonenhancing lesions. (18)F-FDG PET is also useful for evaluating the treatment response at a very early stage after the initial treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment (18)F-FDG uptake values may have a prognostic value in patients with PCNSL. In conclusion, (18)F-FDG PET is very useful in the diagnosis of typical PCNSL and can differentiate PCNSL from other malignant brain tumors. However, the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET is limited in the diagnosis of atypical PCNSL.

Title: Detection of glioblastoma response to temozolomide combined with bevacizumab based on muMRI and muPET imaging reveals [18F]-fluoro-L-thymidine as an early and robust predictive marker for treatment efficacy.
Abstract: The individualized care of glioma patients ought to benefit from imaging biomarkers as precocious predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Contrast enhanced MRI and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET are routinely used in clinical settings; their ability to forecast the therapeutic response is controversial. The objectives of our preclinical study were to analyze sensitive microMRI and/or microPET imaging biomarkers to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic and/or chemotherapeutic regimens. Human U87 and U251 orthotopic glioma models were implanted in nude rats. Temozolomide and/or bevacizumab were administered. microMRI (anatomical, diffusion, and microrheological parameters) and microPET ([(18)F]-FDG and [(18)F]-fluoro-l-thymidine [FLT]-PET) studies were undertaken soon (t(1)) after treatment initiation compared with late anatomical microMRI evaluation of tumor volume (t(2)) and overall survival. In both models, FDG and FLT uptakes were attenuated at t(1) in response to temozolomide alone or with bevacizumab. The distribution of FLT, reflecting intratumoral heterogeneity, was also modified. FDG was less predictive for treatment efficacy than was FLT (also highly correlated with outcome, P < .001 for both models). Cerebral blood volume was significantly decreased by temozolomide + bevacizumab and was correlated with survival for rats with U87 implants. While FLT was highly predictive of treatment efficacy, a combination of imaging biomarkers was superior to any one alone (P < .0001 in both tumors with outcome). Our results indicate that FLT is a sensitive predictor of treatment efficacy and that predictability is enhanced by a combination of imaging biomarkers. These findings may translate clinically in that individualized glioma treatments could be decided in given patients after PET/MRI examinations.

Title: Differentiating primary CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma multiforme: assessment using arterial spin labeling, diffusion-weighted imaging, and (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in differentiating primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) from glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs). METHODS: Fifty-six patients including 19 with PCNSL and 37 with GBM were retrospectively studied. From the ASL data, an absolute tumor blood flow (aTBF) and a relative tumor blood flow (rTBF) were obtained within the enhancing portion of each tumor. In addition, the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) and the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) were obtained from DWI and FDG-PET data, respectively. Each of the four parameters was compared between PCNSLs and GBMs using Kruskal-Wallis test. The performance in discriminating between PCNSLs and GBMs was evaluated using the receiver-operating characteristics analysis. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) values were compared among the four parameters using a nonparametric method. RESULTS: The aTBF, rTBF, and ADCmin were significantly higher in GBMs (mean aTBF +/- SD = 91.6 +/- 56.0 mL/100 g/min, mean rTBF +/- SD = 2.61 +/- 1.61, mean ADCmin +/- SD = 0.78 +/- 0.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) than in PCNSLs (mean aTBF +/- SD = 37.3 +/- 10.5 mL/100 g/min, mean rTBF +/- SD = 1.24 +/- 0.37, mean ADCmin +/- SD = 0.61 +/- 0.13 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p < 0.005, respectively). In addition, SUVmax was significantly lower in GBMs (mean +/- SD = 13.1 +/- 6.34) than in PCNSLs (mean +/- SD = 22.5 +/- 7.83) (p < 0.005). The AUC for aTBF (0.888) was higher than those for rTBF (0.810), ADCmin (0.768), and SUVmax (0.848), although their difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: ASL perfusion imaging is useful for differentiating PCNSLs from GBMs as well as DWI and FDG-PET.

Title: Comparison of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-fluorothymidine PET in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The objective was to compare F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Visual and quantitative analyses were derived from static FDG PET and static and dynamic FLT PET in 15 patients with suspected recurrence of treated grade 2 glioma or worse with a new focus of Gd contrast enhancement on MRI. For FDG PET, SUVmax and the ratio of lesion SUVmax to the SUVmean of contralateral white matter were measured. For FLT PET, SUVmax and Patlak-derived metabolic flux parameter Kimax were measured for the same locus. A 5-point visual confidence scale was applied to FDG PET and FLT PET. Receiver operating curve analysis was applied to visual and quantitative results. Differences between recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis were tested by Kruskal-Wallis analysis. On the basis of follow-up Gd-enhanced MRI, lesion-specific recurrent tumor was defined as a definitive increase in size of the lesion, and radiation necrosis was defined as stability or regression. RESULTS: For FDG SUVmax, the FDG ratio of lesion-white matter, and FLT Kimax, there was a significant difference between mean values for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis. Recurrent tumor was best identified by the FDG ratio of lesion-contralateral normal white matter (area under the curve of 0.98, confidence interval of 0.91 to 1.00, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 75% for an optimized cutoff value of 1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Both quantitative and visual determinations allow accurate differentiation between recurrent glioma and radiation necrosis by both FDG and FLT PET. In this small series, FLT PET offers no advantage over FDG PET.

Title: Differentiation of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and intracranial diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma using (11)C-methionine and (18)F-FDG PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to examine the usefulness of PET with C-methionine (MET) and F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the differentiation of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and intracranial diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 22 patients retrospectively with an enhancing brain tumor on MRI, including 15 GBM and 7 DLBCL, which was confirmed by histopathology. Dynamic PET scans with MET and FDG were performed for preoperative differential diagnosis. We assessed the images qualitatively and quantitatively. In quantitative assessment, the SUVmax was used on FDG PET and both late and early phases on MET PET. In addition, the ratio of SUVmax in the late and early phases on MET-PET was evaluated (DeltaSUVmax). RESULTS: SUVmax on FDG PET of DLBCL was significantly higher than that of GBM. Setting an SUVmax of 12.0 as the cutoff for differentiating DLBCL from GBM, 1 GBM and 1 DLBCL were found to be false-positive and false-negative, respectively.SUVmax in the late and early phases of MET-PET was not significantly different between DLBCL and GBM; however, we also found significant differences in DeltaSUVmax on MET-PET. Using DeltaSUVmax 1.17 as the cutoff, we could differentiate DLBCL from GBM completely. In the present study, DeltaSUVmax on MET-PET was slightly superior to SUVmax on FDG PET. CONCLUSIONS: Both SUVmax on FDG PET and DeltaSUVmax on MET-PET were considered to be good diagnostic tests when encountering difficulties in this differential diagnosis.

Title: The influence of the combined treatment with Vadimezan (ASA404) and taxol on the growth of U251 glioblastoma xenografts.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: One of the most important biological characteristics of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is high vascular density. Vadimezan (ASA404, DMXAA) belongs to the class of small molecule vascular disrupting agents (VDA) that cause disruption of established tumor vessels and subsequent tumor hemorrhagic necrosis. Its selective antivascular effect is mediated by intratumoral induction of several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ASA404 acts synergistically with taxanes. In this study, we investigated if treatment of mice bearing U251 human glioblastoma xenografts with ASA404 and taxol may be synergistic. Therapy response was evaluated by measuring changes in tumor size and metabolic activity using 18F-FDG PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emision tomography) imaging. METHODS: U251 cells were inoculated s.c. in the right hind limb of NMRI-Foxn1nu athymic female nude mice. Animals were randomly assigned into 4 groups (7-9 animals/group) for treatment: control, taxol, ASA404, and ASA404 plus taxol. The animals received either a single dose of taxol (10 mg/kg), ASA404 (27.5 mg/kg), or taxol (10 mg/kg) plus ASA404 (27.5 mg/kg) administered i.p.; ASA404 was administred 24 h after the treatment with taxol. 4 and 24 h after treatment with ASA404 (28 and 48 h hours after treatment with taxol) 18 F-FDG PET scans were performed. RESULTS: The treatment with taxol did not affect the tumor growth in comparison to untreated controls. The treatment of animals with single dose ASA404 alone or in combination with taxol caused a significant delay in tumor growth. The combined treatment did not decrease the growth of the xenografts significantly more than ASA404 alone, but early changes in tumor 18 F-FDG uptake preceded subsequent growth inhibition. The tumor weights, which were determined at the end of treatment, were lower in case of combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with ASA404 alone or in combination with taxol showed antitumoral effects in our glioblastoma model probably through destruction of blood vessels. The implications for the anticancer effect of this compound warrant further preclinical studies. 18F-FDG PET appears to be a promising tool to monitor treatment with ASA404 early in the course of therapy.

Title: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) mimicking high-grade glioma on delayed F-18 FDG PET imaging.
Abstract: The purpose of our study was to determine the increase in F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a patient with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) between early and late scan times using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 FDG at conventional (60 minutes [min] after injection, PET(60)) and delayed (300 min after injection, PET(300)) intervals. PET(60) and PET(300) imaging was performed on a pathologically proven PML lesion. The PML lesion in the posterior fossa exhibited an increase in F-18 FDG uptake of 52% between early and late times, which was in the range of that in high-grade gliomas. Thus, dual-time-point PET with F-18 FDG may not be able to differentiate between infectious and malignant brain lesions.

Title: Conversion of arterial input functions for dual pharmacokinetic modeling using Gd-DTPA/MRI and 18F-FDG/PET.
Abstract: Reaching the full potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positron emission tomography (PET) dual modality systems requires new methodologies in quantitative image analyses. In this study, methods are proposed to convert an arterial input function (AIF) derived from gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) in MRI, into a (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) AIF in PET, and vice versa. The AIFs from both modalities were obtained from manual blood sampling in a F98-Fisher glioblastoma rat model. They were well fitted by a convolution of a rectangular function with a biexponential clearance function. The parameters of the biexponential AIF model were found statistically different between MRI and PET. Pharmacokinetic MRI parameters such as the volume transfer constant (K(trans)), the extravascular-extracellular volume fraction (nu(e)), and the blood volume fraction (nu(p)) calculated with the Gd-DTPA AIF and the Gd-DTPA AIF converted from (18)F-FDG AIF normalized with or without blood sample were not statistically different. Similarly, the tumor metabolic rates of glucose (TMRGlc) calculated with (18) F-FDG AIF and with (18) F-FDG AIF obtained from Gd-DTPA AIF were also found not statistically different. In conclusion, only one accurate AIF would be needed for dual MRI-PET pharmacokinetic modeling in small animal models.

Title: FDG-PET predicts survival in recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.
Abstract: Prognosis of recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, although bevacizumab has been documented in that context. This study aimed to determine the independent prognostic value of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of recurrent HGG after combined treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared with other documented prognostic variables. Twenty-five adult patients with histologically proven HGG were included at recurrence. Brain FDG-PET imaging was performed within 6 weeks of starting chemotherapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Response based on MRI was assessed every 2 months according to revised assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Median PFS and OS were 4 months (range, 0.9-10.4 months) and 7.2 months (range, 1.2-41.7 months), respectively. At 6 months, PFS and OS rate were 16.0% and 72.0%. FDG uptake was the most powerful predictor of both PFS and OS, using either univariate or multivariate analysis, among all variables tested: histological grade, Karnofsky performance status, steroid intake, and number of previous treatments. Moreover, FDG uptake was also prognostic of response to bevacizumab-based therapy. This study provides the first evidence that pretreatment FDG-PET can serve as an imaging biomarker in recurrent HGG for predicting survival following anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab.

Title: (1)(1)C-methionine and (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT in the evaluation of patients with suspected primary and residual/recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer in tumor imaging, but its use for brain gliomas and recurrence is limited by the high (18)F-FDG uptake in normal brain tissue. (11)C-methionine (MET) has low uptake in the normal brain tissue, providing potential advantages over (18)F-FDG. The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of (11)C-MET compared to (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with suspected primary and residual/recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Eighty paired PET/CT scans using (11)C-MET and (18)F-FDG were performed on 44 newly diagnosed patients with suspected gliomas and 36 post-operative patients with suspected residual/recurrent tumors. PET/CT results were evaluated by visual and semiquantitative analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of gliomas and residual/recurrent tumors were calculated using visual analysis. Tumor to contralateral normal gray matter (T/G) ratio was calculated for semiquantitative analysis. RESULTS: Final pathology of the 44 newly diagnosed patients included 26 gliomas (14 high-grade and 12 low-grade tumors) and 18 non-glioma benign lesions. Residual/recurrent gliomas were verified in 28 patients and excluded in 8/36 post-operative patients by subsequent histopathologic examination and/or clinical follow-up for more than six months. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (11)C-MET PET/CT were 88.5%, 83.3% and 86.4% for gliomas and 96.4%, 87.5% and 94.4% for residual/recurrent gliomas, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 50.0%, 88.9% and 65.9% for gliomas and 46.4%, 100.0% and 58.3% for residual/recurrent gliomas, respectively. (11)C-MET had a higher sensitivity than (18)F-FDG (83.3% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.031) in low-grade gliomas, but had no significant difference in sensitivity from (18)F-FDG for high-grade gliomas (92.9% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.219). (11)C-MET T/G uptake ratios in high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas and benign lesions were 1.94 +/- 0.53, 1.78 +/- 0.61 and 1.06 +/- 0.34, respectively. (18)F-FDG T/G uptake ratios in high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas and benign lesions were 1.05 +/- 0.37, 0.66 +/- 0.14 and 0.63 +/- 0.17, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: (11)C-MET PET/CT is superior to (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detecting and delineating gliomas and residual/recurrent tumors, especially low-grade gliomas and residual/recurrent lesions present in gray matter, but its role in non-invasive grading of the tumors is limited.

Title: L- and D-S-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)homocysteine.
Abstract: High energy consumption and constant proliferation are the hallmarks of all cells with a malignant phenotype. To maintain a high pace of protein and DNA synthesis, such cells have an increased demand for various nutrients, glucose, and amino acids (aa). Therefore, radiotracers such as (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose, which is taken up by the cell through the glucose transporter, are often used with positron emission tomography (PET) to detect cancerous tumors. This agent, however, is not able to distinguish between malignant tissue, inflammation, and tissues that normally have high glucose consumption, such as the brain (1). As an alternative, radiolabeled aa and their derivatives, such as those of phenylalanine and tyrosine, have been used to detect neoplastic tumors because these lesions show increased utilization of aa for the synthesis of proteins and other cellular components (2, 3). To accommodate the increased demand for aa, the malignant cells overexpress the aa transporters (phenylalanine and tyrosine use the l-type transporter), and this phenomenon promotes the rapid uptake and accumulation of the radiolabeled aa in the tumors. Therefore, noninvasive imaging with a radiolabeled aa can be used to detect cancerous lesions within a short time after administration of an aa tracer. Among the various radiolabeled aa tracers, [(18)F]-alpha-methyl-tyrosine is often used in the clinic, but the low yield of the final labeled product prohibits the use of this labeled compound in most oncology centers (1). S-(2-[(11)C]methyl)-l-methionine ([(11)C]MET; half-life of (11)C = ~20 min) is another aa derivative that is widely used for the PET imaging of tumors, but because MET contributes to a diverse array of biosynthetic reactions such as DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, etc., the radiolabeled macromolecules derived from [(11)C]MET along with the biodegradation products of the labeled molecules generate a high background signal in the tissues (4). As a consequence, the imaging of tumors with [(11)C]MET has limited utility in the clinic and this tracer has been used primarily for the noninvasive visualization of gliomas in the brain, and very little information is available to indicate that labeled MET is suitable for the detection of tumors in other parts of the body (3, 4). Investigators developed S-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-homocysteine, an analog of MET, as a possible agent for the imaging of cancerous tumors, but this agent was unstable in aqueous media and could be used for the detection of these lesions (5). In a continued effort to develop an aa derivative that can be used for the imaging of non-glioma tumors, the d and l enantiomers of S-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)homocysteine ([(18)F]-d-FPHCys and [(18)F]-l-FPHCys) were synthesized, and the biodistribution and tumor imaging properties of these compounds in nude mice bearing xenograft tumors derived from different non-glioma human cancer cell lines was investigated (4, 6).

Title: (1)(8)F-Fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography may differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from less malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor and its prognosis is significantly poorer than those of less malignant gliomas. Pathologically, necrosis is one of the most important characteristics that differentiate GBM from lower grade gliomas; therefore, we hypothesized that (18)F fluoromisonidazole (FMISO), a radiotracer for hypoxia imaging, accumulates in GBM but not in lower grade gliomas. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of FMISO positron emission tomography (PET) for the differential diagnosis of GBM from lower grade gliomas. METHODS: This prospective study included 23 patients with pathologically confirmed gliomas. All of the patients underwent FMISO PET and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET within a week. FMISO images were acquired 4 h after intravenous administration of 400 MBq of FMISO. Tracer uptake in the tumor was visually assessed. Lesion to normal tissue ratios and FMISO uptake volume were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 23 glioma patients, 14 were diagnosed as having GBM (grade IV glioma in the 2007 WHO classification), and the others were diagnosed as having non-GBM (5 grade III and 4 grade II). In visual assessment, all GBM patients showed FMISO uptake in the tumor greater than that in the surrounding brain tissues, whereas all the non-GBM patients showed FMISO uptake in the tumor equal to that in the surrounding brain tissues (p </= 0.001). One GBM patient was excluded from FDG PET study because of hyperglycemia. All GBM patients and three of the nine (33%) non-GBM patients showed FDG uptake greater than or equal to that in the gray matter. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing GBM were 100 and 100% for FMISO, and 100 and 66% for FDG, respectively. The lesion to cerebellum ratio of FMISO uptake was higher in GBM patients (2.74 +/- 0.60, range 1.71-3.81) than in non-GBM patients (1.22 +/- 0.06, range 1.09-1.29, p </= 0.001) with no overlap between the groups. The lesion to gray matter ratio of FDG was also higher in GBM patients (1.46 +/- 0.75, range 0.91-3.79) than in non-GBM patients (1.07 +/- 0.62, range 0.66-2.95, p </= 0.05); however, overlap of the ranges did not allow clear differentiation between GBM and non-GBM. The uptake volume of FMISO was larger in GBM (27.18 +/- 10.46%, range 14.02-46.67%) than in non-GBM (6.07 +/- 2.50%, range 2.12-9.22%, p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that FMISO PET may distinguish GBM from lower grade gliomas.

Title: (18)F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine.
Abstract: Increased growth and proliferation are the typical characteristic features of cancer cells, and to maintain these processes the cells have an increased demand for energy. Adenosine triphosphate is the main source of energy in normal cells, and it is produced through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria. However, in cells with a malignant phenotype, the TCA is redirected to synthesize metabolic intermediates that can be used to produce fatty acids and amino acids (aa) that are required for the growth and survival of the tumor cells (1). To meet the energy requirements of cancerous tumors, the aerobic glycolytic pathway, which uses glucose to produce energy, is upregulated and serves as the major source of energy in the tumor cells (2). Therefore, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG), an analog of glucose that is transported into and metabolized similarly to glucose in the cell (after phosphorylation to [(18)F]-FDG-6 phosphate it cannot be further metabolized by glycolysis and remains metabolically trapped within the cell), is often used to detect, stage, and monitor cancer therapy with positron emission tomography (PET) [PubMed]. A major drawback of PET imaging with [(18)F]-FDG is that, in addition to tumor cells, normal cells in the brain, heart, brown adipose tissue, etc., also have high metabolic rates and utilize above-average amounts of glucose, which often leads to the generation of false positive results (2). Moreover, it is known that [(18)F]-FDG imaging cannot distinguish between infection, inflammation, and tumors (2). There are indications that many tumors do not use the glycolytic pathway to produce energy and are consequently invisible to imaging with [(18)F]-FDG (1). Such tumors are believed to produce sufficient energy for survival by metabolizing other nutrients such as glutamine (for details, see Koglin et al. (3)), which has the highest concentration in the blood (up to ~1 mM) among all of the aa circulating in the blood and is metabolized through the glutaminolysis pathway (1). It is believed that tumors that cannot be visualized with PET using [(18)F]-FDG do not derive their energy through glycolysis and probably use the glutaminolysis pathway as an alternate source of energy. In a preliminary in vitro study with 9L (rat brain gliosarcoma cells) and SF188(Bcl-xL) (of human glioblastoma origin) tumor cells that are addicted to glutamine (for details, see Wise and Thompson (4)), it was shown that both cell types had a higher uptake of (18)F-labeled (2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine ([(18)F]4-FGln; an analog of glutamine) than of [(3)H]-glutamine (5). It was also observed that the uptake of [(18)F]4-FGln by the 9L cells was inhibited by l-glutamine, which indicated that both the aa were taken up by the cells through a common transporter. On the basis of these observations, Lieberman et al. studied the biodistribution of [(18)F]4-FGln in normal mice and rats and in mice and rats bearing xenograft tumors (1). The (18)F-labeled compound was also evaluated for the PET detection of tumors in mice and rats bearing these lesions.

Title: Role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography scan in differentiating enhancing brain tumors.
Abstract: AIM: To determine whether F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) can be used to differentiate among common enhancing brain tumors such as gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 20 patients with an enhancing brain tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FDG PET scan was done in all patients pre operatively. For PET image analysis, regions of interest were placed over the tumor (T), contralateral cortex (C), and white matter (WM). Average and maximum pixel values were determined at each site. On the basis of these measurements, average and maximum standard uptake values (SUV avg and SUV max ) were calculated, and comparisons among lesions were then made. RESULTS: SUVavg and SUVmax are significantly higher for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma than for other tumors (P < 0.01). High-grade gliomas showed significantly higher SUVavg and SUVmax than the low grade gliomas (P < 0.05) and metastatic tumor showed higher SUVavg and SUVmax than all gliomas, both low and high grade (P < 0.05). When the lowest values of CNS lymphoma parameter were used as cutoff levels to distinguish CNS lymphomas from other tumors (i.e. 100% sensitivity), SUVmax was the most accurate parameter. Using a SUVmax of 15.0 as a cutoff for diagnosing CNS lymphoma, only one case of metastasis (SUV max , 16.3) was found to be false positive in this study. CONCLUSION: FDG PET appears to provide additional information for differentiating common enhancing malignant brain tumors, namely lymphoma versus high grade glioma and metastatic tumor, particularly when differential diagnoses are difficult to narrow using MRI alone.

Title: A phase II trial of single-agent bevacizumab in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of single-agent bevacizumab in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma and assess correlative advanced imaging parameters. Patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma were treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Complete patient evaluations were repeated every 4 weeks. Correlative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging studies were obtained to evaluate physiologic changes in tumor and tumor vasculature at time points including baseline, 96 h after the first dose, and after the first 4 weeks of therapy. Median overall survival was 12 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.08-22.8). Median progression-free survival was 2.93 months (95% CI: 2.01-4.93), and 6-month progression-free survival was 20.9% (95% CI: 10.3%-42.5%). Thirteen (43%) patients achieved a partial response. The most common grade >/= 3 treatment-related toxicities were hypertension, hypophosphatemia, and thromboembolism. Single-agent bevacizumab produces significant radiographic response in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma but did not meet the 6-month progression-free survival endpoint. Early change in enhancing tumor volume at 4 days after start of therapy was the most significant prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survival.

Title: Detection of recurrence in glioma: a comparative prospective study between Tc-99m GHA SPECT and F-18 FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early and correct diagnosis of tumor recurrence and its differentiation from therapy-related changes is crucial for prompt and adequate management of glioma patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacies of Tc-99m glucoheptonate (GHA) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detection of recurrence in patients with glioma. METHODS: A total of 90 patients with histopathologically proven glioma who had suspicion of recurrence clinically or on magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated using Tc-99m GHA SPECT and FDG PET/CT. Combination of clinical follow-up, repeat imaging, and biopsy (when available) was taken as gold standard. RESULTS: On the basis of gold standard, 59 patients were positive and 31 were negative for tumor recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of GHA SPECT were 85%, 97%, and 89%, respectively, whereas those of FDG PET/CT were 70%, 97%, and 80%, respectively. On subgroup analysis, GHA SPECT performed better than FDG PET/CT in all grades except for grade II gliomas, where both were equally effective. In all, 15 patients had intermodality discordance, with GHA SPECT being correct in 13 of them. CONCLUSIONS: GHA SPECT appears to be a better imaging modality than FDG PET/CT for detection of recurrent gliomas.

Title: Prognostic significance of parameters derived from co-registered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and contrast-enhanced MRI in patients with high-grade glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of the volume and intensity of abnormal (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) accumulation within areas of contrast enhancement on post-therapeutic volumetric MRI. METHODS: A total of 10 patients with Grade III or IV glioma were treated with resection followed by intracavitary radiation therapy with (131)I-labelled antitenascin monoclonal antibody. Patients underwent serial FDG-PET and 1.5 T MR imaging. For each patient, MR and FDG-PET image volumes at each time point were aligned using a rigid-body normalised mutual information algorithm. Contrast-enhancing regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a semi-automated k-means clustering technique. Activity within the ROI on the co-registered PET scan was calculated as a ratio (mean activity ratio; MAR) to activity in contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). The PET lesion was defined as the portion of the ROI associated with activity greater than two standard deviations above the mean in NAWM. Survival was assessed using the logrank test. RESULTS: Larger contrast-enhancing ROIs were strongly associated with an increased MAR (r = 0.51; p<0.002). Enhancing lesions with an MAR >1.2 were associated with decreased survival (p<0.016). In nine patients who died, the MAR on PET correlated inversely with survival duration (r = -0.43; p<0.01), whereas PET lesion volume did not. CONCLUSION: Following intracavitary radiation therapy, the development of contrast-enhancing lesions that are associated with high mean FDG-PET accumulation suggests poor prognosis.

Title: Biopsy targeting gliomas: do functional imaging techniques identify similar target areas?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Because of the heterogeneous nature of glioma, biopsies performed should be targeted at the most anaplastic region. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) techniques have been proposed for identifying the most anaplastic tumor area. However, it is unclear whether the recommended biopsy targets based on these various functional imaging modalities correspond with each other. Thus, the purpose was to evaluate whether they identify similar target areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients with suspected glioma were assessed within 2.3 +/- 3.5 days by MRI, 18F-fluorothymidine-, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Thirty-five patients underwent gross total resection and 26 were stereotactically biopsied. MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla broadband transmit/receive system, using a double-resonant birdcage coil. The MRI protocol comprised of sodium (23Na)-MRI (3D-radial projection imaging), proton spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI, point-resolved spectroscopy), arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and dynamic-susceptibility-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI after a single dose each of gadobenate dimeglumine. Also, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were processed from diffusion tensor images. Image analysis comprised a detailed semiquantitative region of interest analysis of the different parameter values as well as visual identification of the most conspicuous tumor areas on parameter maps, for example, areas with maximum tumor perfusion, highest metabolite ratios of choline-containing compounds/N-acetyl-aspartate, or lowest ADC values within tumor tissue. Colocalization of these areas was then assessed. RESULTS: Regarding tumor vascularity-related parameters and tumor proliferation-related parameters, the higher the glioma grade the higher were the respective parameters in semiquantitative analysis. ADC values decreased with glioma grade. In the whole study population comprising low- (N = 15) and high-grade gliomas (N = 42), except for 23Na-MRI, there was good (>50%) or perfect (100%) agreement of the tumor areas with highest values on parameter images in the majority of cases (>80%), that is, tumor areas with increased thymidine-uptake and highest choline, both suggestive of increased tumor proliferation, and elevated microcirculation as demonstrated by DSC-, arterial spin-labeling-, and DCE-MRI. 23Na-MRI depicted the highest signal within necrotic tumor areas, but non-necrotic gliomas also showed a perfect agreement in more than 61%. 18F-fluorothymidine-PET, DSC-, and DCE-MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging as well as MR spectroscopic imaging correctly detected no glioma heterogeneity in all 15 histologically proven grade II gliomas but identified suspicious areas in all 3 nonenhancing grade III gliomas. CONCLUSION: Both imaging techniques that depict microcirculation and techniques that visualize proliferation identify similar target areas.

Title: The use of FDG-PET to target tumors by radiotherapy.
Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) plays an increasingly important role in radiotherapy, beyond staging and selection of patients. Especially for non-small cell lung cancer, FDG-PET has, in the majority of the patients, led to the safe decrease of radiotherapy volumes, enabling radiation dose escalation and, experimentally, redistribution of radiation doses within the tumor. In limited-disease small cell lung cancer, the role of FDG-PET is emerging. For primary brain tumors, PET based on amino acid tracers is currently the best choice, including high-grade glioma. This is especially true for low-grade gliomas, where most data are available for the use of (11)C-MET (methionine) in radiation treatment planning. For esophageal cancer, the main advantage of FDG-PET is the detection of otherwise unrecognized lymph node metastases. In Hodgkin's disease, FDG-PET is essential for involved-node irradiation and leads to decreased irradiation volumes while also decreasing geographic miss. FDG-PET's major role in the treatment of cervical cancer with radiation lies in the detection of para-aortic nodes that can be encompassed in radiation fields. Besides for staging purposes, FDG-PET is not recommended for routine radiotherapy delineation purposes. It should be emphasized that using PET is only safe when adhering to strictly standardized protocols.

Title: [Combined use of positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine for preoperative evaluation of gliomas].
Abstract: OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of combined use of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine (MET) for the preoperative evaluation of gliomas and to investigate the feasibility of PET in glioma surgery. METHODS: Preoperative FDG (n=25) and/or MET (n=22) PET studies were performed in 26 patients with primary and recurrent adult gliomas. We qualitatively (visual analysis) and quantitatively evaluated the uptake of both tracers in the tumor location. For quantitative analysis, data were analyzed by a region of interest method using the standard uptake value (SUV) and a calculated uptake ratio. We investigated the correlation among the tracer uptake ratios, histological tumor grading and tumor proliferation activity. RESULTS: On visual inspection, no patient (0/9) with high uptake of FDG had low grade gliomas and 94% (14/15) had high grade gliomas, while uptake of MET was present in all patients. On quantitative analysis, histological tumor grade was most reflected in FDG uptake ratio compared with contralateral white matter. The tumor/normal brain (T/N) uptake ratio of MET increased stepwise with increasing histological grade but was not significantly different from tumor grade. In comparison of FDG and MET uptake ratio with proliferation activity, a significant correlation was shown for FDG uptake ratio, but not for the T/N ratio of MET. CONCLUSIONS: MET is useful in detecting and delineating the extent of the tumor, but not in evaluating tumor grade and proliferative activity. The FDG uptake ratio correlates well with tumor grade and proliferative activity. Preoperative PET studies with FDG and MET play complementary roles in the planning of glioma surgery, and integrated information from both tracers helps us to plan the extent of tumor resection.

Title: Differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in high-grade gliomas: assessing the efficacy of 18F-FDG PET, 11C-methionine PET and perfusion MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The authors analyzed the characteristics of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and (11)C-methionine (MET) PET to compare the efficacies of these modalities in making the distinction between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence of high-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were evaluated with dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI, (11)C-MET PET and (18)F-FDG PET to visualize gadolinium-enhanced lesions during the post-radiation follow-up period. In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L(max)/R(max) ratio. RESULTS: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p=0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from the (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET. CONCLUSION: A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.

Title: Metabolic management of glioblastoma multiforme using standard therapy together with a restricted ketogenic diet: Case Report.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been difficult using standard therapy (radiation with temozolomide chemotherapy). The ketogenic diet is used commonly to treat refractory epilepsy in children and, when administered in restricted amounts, can also target energy metabolism in brain tumors. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with progressive memory loss, chronic headaches, nausea, and a right hemisphere multi-centric tumor seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Following incomplete surgical resection, the patient was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme expressing hypermethylation of the MGMT gene promoter. METHODS: Prior to initiation of the standard therapy, the patient conducted water-only therapeutic fasting and a restricted 4:1 (fat: carbohydrate + protein) ketogenic diet that delivered about 600 kcal/day. The patient also received the restricted ketogenic diet concomitantly during the standard treatment period. The diet was supplemented with vitamins and minerals. Steroid medication (dexamethasone) was removed during the course of the treatment. The patient was followed using MRI and positron emission tomography with fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG-PET). RESULTS: After two months treatment, the patient's body weight was reduced by about 20% and no discernable brain tumor tissue was detected using either FDG-PET or MRI imaging. Biomarker changes showed reduced levels of blood glucose and elevated levels of urinary ketones. MRI evidence of tumor recurrence was found 10 weeks after suspension of strict diet therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of confirmed GBM treated with standard therapy together with a restricted ketogenic diet. As rapid regression of GBM is rare in older patients following incomplete surgical resection and standard therapy alone, the response observed in this case could result in part from the action of the calorie restricted ketogenic diet. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of restricted ketogenic diets, administered alone or together with standard treatment, as a therapy for GBM and possibly other malignant brain tumors.

Title: Comparative PET study using F-18 FET and F-18 FDG for the evaluation of patients with suspected brain tumour.
Abstract: The aim of this prospective pilot study in patients with suspected or known brain tumour was to establish the diagnostic value of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) when compared to fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Twenty-five FET PET and FDG PET scans were performed on 21 consecutive patients within 24 months. Final malignant pathology included 11 glioma (eight low-grade, three high grade), two lymphoma, one olfactory ganglioneuroblastoma, one anaplastic meningioma. Benign pathology included two encephalitis and one cortical dysplasia. Definitive pathology was not available in three patients. The accuracy of PET was determined by subsequent surgical histopathology in 12 and clinical/imaging course in nine patients. Median follow-up period was 20 months. FET sensitivity was 93%, specificity 100%, accuracy 96%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) 91%. FDG sensitivity was 27%, specificity 90%, accuracy 52%, PPV 80% and NPV 45%. FET PET is more accurate than FDG PET for detecting malignant brain lesions, especially low-grade gliomas.

Title: Imaging of hypoxic lesions in patients with gliomas by using positron emission tomography with 1-(2-[18F] fluoro-1-[hydroxymethyl]ethoxy)methyl-2-nitroimidazole, a new 18F-labeled 2-nitroimidazole analog.
Abstract: OBJECT: Assessment of hypoxic conditions in brain tumors is important for predicting tumor aggressiveness and treatment response. A new hypoxia imaging agent, 1-(2-[(18)F]fluoro-1-[hydroxymethyl]ethoxy)methyl-2-nitroimidazole (FRP-170), with higher image contrast and faster clearance than preexisting hypoxia tracers for PET, was used to visualize hypoxic tissues in 8 patients with glioma. METHODS: The FRP-170 was injected and PET imaging was performed 2 hours later in 8 patients, including 3 with glioblastoma multiforme, 2 with oligodendroglioma, and 1 each with diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic ganglioglioma, and recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma. All 8 patients also underwent MR imaging, and some patients underwent [(11)C]methionine or [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and proton MR spectroscopy for comparison. Tissues obtained at biopsy or radical resection were immunostained with hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) antibody for the confirmation of hypoxia, except in the patient with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma who was treated using Gamma Knife surgery. RESULTS: The FRP-170 PET images showed marked uptake with upregulation of HIF-1alpha in the 3 glioblastomas multiforme, and moderate uptake in the recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and one oligodendroglioma, but no uptake in the other tumors. The FRP-170 PET images showed positive correlation with HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity and some correlation with FDG PET and MR imaging enhancement, but no correlation with [(11)C]methionine PET. Imaging with FRP-170 PET seemed to be more sensitive for detecting hypoxia than identifying the lactate peak on proton MR spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging with FRP-170 PET can visualize hypoxic lesions in patients with glioma, as confirmed by histological examination. This new method can assess tumor hypoxia preoperatively and noninvasively.

Title: Striatal "function-metabolism" mismatch on F-18 FDG/F-18 FDOPA PET/CT.
Abstract: Decrease in gray matter metabolism following cranial irradiation has been documented, but the functional relevance of this finding has not been documented. This case of "function-metabolism" mismatch in the striatum following radiation for a grade III frontoparietal glioma demonstrates that the down-regulation of glucose metabolism as demonstrated by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography is associated with preservation of presynaptic dopaminergic function by the striatal neurons which was demonstrated on a correlative l-3,4-dihydroxy-6-F-flurophenylalanine (F-18 FDOPA) study. The reversibility of this down-regulation is demonstrated in a follow-up scan further proving that there is no neurodegeneration involved.

Title: Comparison of (18)F-FET and (18)F-FDG PET in brain tumors.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) in patients with brain lesions suspicious of cerebral gliomas. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with suspicion of cerebral glioma were included in this study. From 30 to 50 min after injection of 180 MBq (18)F-FET, a first PET scan ((18)F-FET scan) was performed. Thereafter, 240 MBq (18)F-FDG was injected and a second PET scan was acquired from 30 to 60 min after the second injection ((18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan). The cerebral accumulation of (18)F-FDG was calculated by decay corrected subtraction of the (18)F-FET scan from the (18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan. Tracer uptake was evaluated by visual scoring and by lesion-to-background (L/B) ratios. The imaging results were compared with the histological results and prognosis. RESULTS: Histology revealed 24 low-grade gliomas (LGG) of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II and 19 high-grade gliomas (HGG) of WHO Grade III or IV, as well as nine others, mainly benign histologies. The gliomas showed increased (18)F-FET uptake (>normal brain) in 86% and increased (18)F-FDG uptake (>white matter) in 35%. (18)F-FET PET provided diagnostically useful delineation of tumor extent while this was impractical with (18)F-FDG due to high tracer uptake in the gray matter. A local maximum in the tumor area for biopsy guidance could be identified with (18)F-FET in 76% and with (18)F-FDG in 28%. The L/B ratios showed significant differences between LGG and HGG for both tracers but considerable overlap so that reliable preoperative grading was not possible. A significant correlation of tracer uptake with overall survival was found with (18)F-FDG only. In some benign lesions like abscesses, increased uptake was observed for both tracers indicating a limited specificity of both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FET PET is superior to (18)F-FDG for biopsy guidance and treatment planning of cerebral gliomas. The uptake of (18)F-FDG is associated with prognosis, but the predictive value is limited and a histological evaluation of tumor tissue remains necessary. Therefore, amino acids like (18)F-FET are the preferred PET tracers for the clinical management of cerebral gliomas.

Title: Diagnostic value of kinetic analysis using dynamic 18F-FDG-PET in patients with malignant primary brain tumor.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of quantitative imaging of glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) using kinetic analysis for differentiating between high-grade glioma and central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. METHODS: Dynamic fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET scans obtained in 20 patients with high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III, five lesions; grade IV, 15 lesions) and in 12 patients with CNS lymphoma (16 lesions) were retrospectively reviewed. Applying a three-compartment model, parametric images of K1, k2, k3, and k4 and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR(Glc)) were obtained. RESULTS: On visual analysis, one grade III glioma lesion showed an increase of K1, k2, and k3 values as observed on their respective images. Four grade IV glioma lesions showed an increase of K1 and k2, 11 of k3, and six of CMR(Glc) on their respective images. Fourteen CNS lymphoma lesions showed an increase of K1, 16 of k3, two of k4, and 14 of CMR(Glc). Both k3 and CMR(Glc) values (mean+/-SD) of CNS lymphoma (0.096+/-0.046 and 77.4+/-37.7, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the normal gray matter (0.059+/-0.015 and 41.3+/-9.3, respectively; P<0.007 and P<0.002, respectively). The k3 value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (0.058+/-0.022) and grade IV (0.065+/-0.024) gliomas (P<0.03 and P<0.04, respectively). The CMR(Glc) value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (33.8+/-7.8) and grade IV (41.5+/-23.1) gliomas (P<0.001 and P<0.004, respectively). The value of k2 of CNS lymphoma was significantly lower than that of grade IV glioma (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The direct measurement of the regional rate constants by kinetic analysis might be useful for the delineation of CNS lymphoma and for differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and CNS lymphoma.

Title: Indolent dorsal midbrain tumor: new findings based on positron emission tomography.
Abstract: OBJECT: Intrinsic tumors arising in the dorsal midbrain cause obstructive hydrocephalus and have an indolent clinical course. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and l- [methyl-(11)C]methionine (MET) was used to evaluate the biological behaviors of dorsal midbrain tumors. METHODS: The authors report on 4 patients (3 males and 1 female) with dorsal midbrain tumors who presented with obstructive hydrocephalus. A diagnosis was made with MR imaging in each patient. To manage the hydrocephalus, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed in all cases. The patients did not undergo any other surgical procedures except endoscopic biopsy procedure, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. The patients in 3 cases underwent FDG- and MET-PET within 6 months of CSF-diverting procedures, and the patient in 1 case underwent PET 10 years after the procedure. RESULTS: After the CSF-diverting procedure, clinical symptoms resolved or improved in all patients. Gliosis or glial proliferation was diagnosed in 1 patient, and possible low-grade glioma in 2 patients. Although all tumors appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, their appearance on T1-weighted images was variable (iso- and/or hypointense), and partial lesion enhancement was observed on images from 2 patients. On the other hand, the PET features of these lesions were almost identical, and the scans did not show a high uptake of FDG and MET compared with the cortical uptake in a normal brain. The mean tumor tissue/normal tissue ratio of FDG uptake was 0.65, and that of MET was 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: Positron emission tomography findings suggested that the indolent dorsal midbrain lesion had nontumorous characteristics, thus supporting a good prognosis. Positron emission tomography studies may be more informative and predictive of the biological behavior of dorsal midbrain tumors than a biopsy procedure.

Title: Positron emission tomography-guided volumetric resection of supratentorial high-grade gliomas: a survival analysis in 66 consecutive patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Integrating positron emission tomographic (PET) images into the image-guided resection of high-grade gliomas (HGG) has shown that metabolic information on tumor heterogeneity and distribution are useful for planning surgery, improve tumor delineation, and provide a final target contour different from that obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone in about 80% of the procedures. Moreover, PET guidance helps to increase the amount of tumor removed and to target image-guided resection to anaplastic tissue areas. The present study aims to evaluate whether PET-guided volumetric resection (VR) in supratentorial HGG might add benefit to the patient's outcome. METHODS: PET images using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (n=23) and [11C]methionine (n=43) were combined with MRI scans in the planning of VR procedures performed at the initial stage in 66 consecutive patients (43 M/23 F) with supratentorial HGG according to the technique previously described. In all cases (35 anaplastic gliomas [20 astrocytomas, 10 oligoastrocytomas, 5 oligodendrogliomas] and 31 glioblastomas [GBM]), level and distribution of PET tracer uptake were analyzed to define a PET contour projected on MRI scans to define a final target contour for VR. Maximal tumor resection was accomplished in each case, with the intention to remove the entire abnormal metabolic area comprised in the surgical planning. Early postoperative MRI and PET assessed tumor resection. Survival analysis was performed separately in anaplastic gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme according to the presence or absence of residual tracer uptake on postoperative PET and according to the presence or absence of residual contrast enhancement on postoperative MRI. RESULTS: Preoperatively, metabolic information helped the surgical planning. In all procedures, PET contributed to define a final target contour different from that obtained with MRI alone. Postoperatively, 46 of 66 patients had no residual PET tracer uptake (total PET resection), 23 of 66 had no residual MRI contrast enhancement. No additional neurological morbidity due to the technique was reported. A total PET tracer uptake resection was associated with a significantly longer survival in anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.0071) and in glioblastoma multiforme (P = 0.0001), respectively. A total MRI contrast enhancement resection was not correlated with a significantly better survival, neither in anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.6089) nor in glioblastoma multiforme (P = 0.6806). CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection of the increased PET tracer uptake prolongs the survival of HGG patients. Because PET information represents a more specific marker than MRI enhancement for detecting anaplastic tumor tissue, PET-guidance increases the amount of anaplastic tissue removed in HGG.

Title: Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion on ictal FDG PET in astrocytoma.
Abstract: Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion (CCH) is a rare phenomenon and reflects the close anatomical and functional relationship between the frontal brain region and its mediated remote effect on the contralateral cerebellum via the corticopontocerebellar pathway. Although it is well documented on cerebral single photon emission tomography (SPECT) in patients with epilepsy, it is rarely observed in seizures originating from brain tumours. We report a 41-y-old man who whilst undergoing (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for investigation of suspected glioma, developed a generalized seizure. The scan performed shortly after seizure onset demonstrated intense metabolic activity in the right superior frontal lobe and in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere consistent with CCH.

Title: Differentiation between malignant transformation and tumour recurrence by (68)Ga-bombesin and (18)F-FDG-PET, in patients with low grade gliomas.
Abstract: Treatment of gliomas is multimodal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the posttreatment course is of limited value due to therapy-induced changes. In low-grade gliomas (LGG) malignant transformation is of special interest. Our patients and methods were as follows: In nine consecutive patients with LGG we examined the role of bombesin labelled with gallium-68 ((68)Ga-bombesin) studied with positron emission tomography (PET), in addition to fluoro-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in the differential diagnosis of tumour recurrence versus malignant transformation. We used (68)Ga-bombesin combined with (18)F-FDG-PET in these patients with suspicious new contrast enhancement at the original tumour site or resection cavity in MRI. Eight patients were operated. In one patient, tumour recurrence was most likely as shown by the PET findings and chemotherapy was administered. Our results have shown that in this last mentioned patient after the follow-up period, MRI contrast enhancement was definitively regressive. In the operated patients the tumour was graded as glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma and WHO grade III tumour. In two patients histological grading confirmed the PET findings without malignant transformation. In all of the 9 patients the combination of (68)Ga-bombesin and (18)F-FDG-PET predicted correctly malignant transformation or recurrence of the initial tumour grade which shows that (68)Ga-bombesin-PET can provide additional important information to detect a malignant transformation. In conclusion it is crucial for the patient to differentiate the nature of the new lesion in order to endorse an aggressive or non-aggressive treatment.

Title: Usefulness and limitations of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the detection of malignancy of orbital tumors.
Abstract: Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) was assessed as a method for providing information about the malignancy of orbital tumors. Twelve patients with 13 orbital tumors underwent [18F]FDG PET followed by biopsy or tumor removal via a transcranial approach. The accumulation ratio between the tumor and the contralateral normal tissue (T/N ratio) was calculated for 10 of the 13 lesions. The T/N ratio in benign lesions was compared with that in malignant tumors. Histological examination identified 7 lesions as malignant: anaplastic astrocytoma of the optic nerve in 1 patient, which recurred as glioblastoma of the optic nerve, malignant lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type in 1 patient, malignant melanoma in 1 patient, adenoid cystic carcinoma in 2 patients, and adenocarcinoma (unknown origin) in 1 patient. The T/N ratio was 1.06 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- standard deviation) in benign tumors, and significantly higher at 1.81 +/- 0.27 in malignant tumors (p = 0.0027). Both patterns of high and iso uptake of [18F]FDG were found in orbital pseudotumor. [18F]FDG PET can determine the malignancy of orbital tumors, but cannot distinguish malignant tumor from inflammatory disease such as pseudotumor.

Title: Bimedial rectus hypermetabolism in convergence spasm as observed on positron emission tomography.
Abstract: A 52-year-old man developed vertical gaze palsy, convergence spasm, and convergence-retraction nystagmus due to glioblastoma of the right thalamus. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) inadvertently demonstrated markedly increased metabolism in the medial rectus muscles. The hypermetabolism indicates active contraction of these extraocular muscles due to excessive convergence drive attributed to inappropriate activation or disrupted inhibition of convergence neurons by the diencephalic lesion.

Title: No relationship between 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and expression of Glut-1 and -3 and hexokinase I and II in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare glucose metabolism, measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET), with the expression of Glut-1 and -3 and hexokinase I (Hex I) and II in high-grade glioma. The retrospective study involved 27 patients with WHO classification grade III and IV glioma, with either newly diagnosed or recurrent tumours. Patients underwent dynamic and static [18F]FDG-PET to glucose metabolic rate (MRGlu) and standardised uptake value (SUV), respectively. Tumour biopsies were obtained and stained using immunohistochemistry for the expression of Glut-1, -3, Hex I and II. Relationships between variables were studied using Spearman's rank correlation test. Results showed that the expression of Glut-1, Glut-3, Hex I and Hex II varied between and within the tumour samples. The mean of MRGlu was 0.2 (range 0.09-0.25) micromol/min/ml and that of SUV was 4.2 (range 3.2-5.2). There were no significant relationships among the tumour expression of any of the proteins studied with either MRGlu or SUV (p>0.21 for all). In conclusion, the lack of relationship between the immunohistochemical expression of Glut-1, -3, Hex I or II and glucose metabolism measured using [18F]FDG-PET in patients with high-grade glioma may be due to the tissue heterogeneity and presence of necrosis in high-grade tumours.

Title: FDG, MET or CHO? The quest for the optimal PET tracer for glioma imaging continues.
Abstract: This Practice Point commentary discusses a study by Kato et al. that assessed the usefulness of three PET tracers--(11)C-methionine (MET), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and (11)C-choline--for the metabolic evaluation of gliomas. The authors measured the ratio of tumor uptake to normal brain uptake (T/N ratio), with the frontal cortex as reference region, and analyzed the correlations between tracer uptake and tumor grade, type, and proliferation activity. Whereas all three tracers showed a similar correlation between the T/N ratio and tumor grade in astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, MET proved to be the most user-friendly marker in all gliomas as it enables the straightforward localization of 'hot lesions' and provides outstanding quantitative metabolic parameters. Here we highlight a few methodological issues arising from Kato et al.'s study and, consequently, we urge the PET community to reach a consensus on an objective approach towards the evaluation of PET tracers in the field of neuro-oncology.

Title: Changes in tumor metabolism as readout for Mammalian target of rapamycin kinase inhibition by rapamycin in glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Inhibition of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is being evaluated for treatment of a variety of malignancies. However, the effects of mTOR inhibitors are cytostatic and standard size criteria do not reliably identify responding tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether response to mTOR inhibition could be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumor metabolism. EXPERIMENT DESIGN: Glucose, thymidine, and amino acid utilization of human glioma cell lines with varying degrees of sensitivity to mTOR inhibition were assessed by measuring in vitro uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), [18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT), and [3H]l-tyrosine before and after treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The tumor metabolic activity in vivo was monitored by small-animal PET of tumor-bearing mice. The mechanisms underlying changes in metabolic activity were analyzed by measuring expression and functional activity of enzymes and transporters involved in the uptake of the studied imaging probes. RESULTS: In sensitive cell lines, rapamycin decreased [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT uptake by up to 65% within 24 hours after the start of therapy. This was associated with inhibition of hexokinase and thymidine kinase 1. In contrast, [3H]l-tyrosine uptake was unaffected by rapamycin. The effects of rapamycin on glucose and thymidine metabolism could be imaged noninvasively by PET. In sensitive tumors, [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT uptake decreased within 48 hours by 56 +/- 6% and 52 +/- 8%, respectively, whereas there was no change in rapamycin-resistant tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These encouraging preclinical data warrant clinical trials evaluating [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT-PET for monitoring treatment with mTOR inhibitors in patients.

Title: Grading of brain glioma with 1-11C-acetate PET: comparison with 18F-FDG PET.
Abstract: The objective of this study is to reevaluate the clinical significance of 1-11C-acetate (ACE) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with brain glioma, in comparison with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. METHODS: Ten patients with histologically proven glioma were included in this study. They underwent PET examination with both FDG and ACE on separate days. For ACE PET, 20-min data acquisition was performed just after the administration of 740 MBq of ACE; 10-20-min data were used for the analysis. FDG PET data acquisition for 10 min started 60 min postinjection of 370 MBq of FDG, approximately. Both reconstructed images were converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) images for patient body weight and injected dose. Regions of interest were placed on the tumor and the contralateral cerebral cortex, and SUV and tumor-to-cortex ratio (T/C) were calculated; these values were compared between high- and low-grade gliomas. RESULTS: SUV and T/C of ACE PET showed significant difference (SUV: 2.63+/-0.46 vs. 1.85+/-0.56, P=.03; T/C: 2.36+/-0.63 vs. 1.14+/-0.36, P=.02). In contrast, FDG PET revealed no significant difference in SUV or T/C between high- and low-grade gliomas (SUV: 7.13+/-4.31 vs. 4.71+/-1.27, P=.31; T/C: 0.98+/-0.55 vs. 0.62+/-0.09, P=.22). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study revealed that ACE PET is a promising tracer for the grading of brain glioma.

Title: Positron emission tomography-guided conformal fast neutron therapy for glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) continues to be a difficult therapeutic challenge. Our study was conducted to determine whether improved survival and tumor control could be achieved with modern delivery of fast neutron radiation using three-dimensional treatment planning. Ten patients were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included pathologic diagnosis of GBM, age >or=18 years, and KPS >or=60. Patients underwent MRI and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG PET) as part of initial three-dimensional treatment planning. Sequential targets were treated with noncoplanar fields to a total dose of 18 Gy in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Median and 1-year overall survival were 55 weeks and 60%, respectively. One patient remains alive at last follow-up 255 weeks after diagnosis. Median progression-free survival was 16 weeks, and all patients had tumor progression by 39 weeks. Treatment was clinically well tolerated, but evidence of mild to moderate gliosis and microvascular sclerosis consistent with radiation injury was observed at autopsy in specimens taken from regions of contralateral brain that received approximately 6-10 Gy. Fast neutron radiation using modern imaging, treatment planning, and beam delivery was feasible to a total dose of 18 Gy, but tumor control probability was poor in comparison to that predicted from a dose-response model based on older studies. Steep dose-response curves for both tumor control and neurotoxicity continue to present a challenge to establishing a therapeutic window for fast neutron radiation in GBM, even with modern techniques.

Title: Resection of gliomas using positron emission tomography/computed tomography neuronavigation.
Abstract: Two patients presented with provisional diagnoses of glioma. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging failed to show the boundaries of the tumor clearly. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine clearly showed the location, extent, and heterogeneity of the tumors. The tumors were resected under PET/CT neuronavigation guidance. Histological examination of the specimens showed that PET/CT neuronavigation provided reliable distinction between normal brain and glioma, and that the uptake of PET tracers can indicate the degree of proliferation.

Title: [11C] methionine and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of [11C] methionine (MET) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical and/or conservative treatment, 28 patients (pts) with GBM underwent FDG and MET PET on average 12.7 months after the diagnosis had been established. Scans were evaluated visually and by calculating the maximal tumor SUV as well as the ratio of tumor vs. contralateral region (RTu). The degree of tracer uptake was compared with survival time, disease duration and MRI findings. RESULTS: The mean overall duration of survival was 12.7 months. The patients were divided into two groups: those that survived less than 12 months and those that survived longer than 12 months. Focally increased uptake was revealed by MET PET in 24 patients and by FDG PET in 2 patients. On MRI scans, viable tumor tissue was suspected in 18 patients. No correlations were registered between FDG/MET uptake and survival time or disease duration respectively; Kaplan-Meier calculations were negative in this regard. Similarly, negative results were obtained in subgroups of patients who had undergone microsurgical resection and whose disease was at least of 6 months' duration, and additionally in a subgroup who had undergone their last treatment longer than 6 months ago. With respect to survival groups, a positive MET PET was associated with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 8%. SUV and RTu values did not differ between patients with positive or negative MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study FDG PET seems to be of limited value in the work-up of recurrent GBM because of its lower sensitivity than MET PET and the fact that it allows no prediction of the outcome. MET PET visualizes viable tumor tissue without adding any prognostic information and appears to be in no way superior to conventional imaging.

Title: Association between fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and 1p and 19q loss of heterozygosity in World Health Organization Grade II gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECT: Oligodendroglial tumors harboring combined 1p and 19q loss (1p/19q LOH) are characterized by a favorable prognosis and response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but detection of 1p/19q LOH relies on postoperative procedures. The authors investigated the potential of fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) to predict 1p/19q LOH preoperatively in tumors whose appearance on initial magnetic resonance images was consistent with that of low-grade glioma. METHODS: The study population comprised 25 patients who had undergone preoperative FDG-PET followed by tumor resection. Neuronavigation ensured a precise match of FDG uptake with the site of biopsy. All tumor specimens were graded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Microsatellite analysis was used to identify 1p/19q LOH. In this series, 16 of 25 gliomas corresponded to WHO Grade II. In eight of these 16, 1p/19q LOH was detected. Raised glucose utilization within the tumor was seen in the six of eight WHO Grade II gliomas with 1p/19q LOH and in none of the WHO Grade II gliomas without this genetic alteration (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential of FDG-PET to predict 1p/19q LOH in WHO Grade II gliomas.

Title: Surgical decision for adult optic glioma based on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study.
Abstract: A 51-year-old male presented with a 5-year history of progressive right exophthalmos and visual loss. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right intraorbital lesion. [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET) revealed high uptake in the tumor. No FDG was accumulated in the remaining optic tract. He underwent removal of the tumor. The histological diagnosis was optic glioma. Six months after the operation, the tumor recurred, and a second operation was performed to spare the visual acuity of the other eye, which remained stable for 1.5 years after the first operation. However, the patient died 2 years after the first operation of liver dysfunction. Adult optic glioma tends to rapidly extend into the surrounding tissue and to affect the contralateral visual pathway. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are imperative. In the present case, [(18)F]FDG-PET was valuable for evaluating malignancy to determine whether radical surgery was indicated to preserve the remaining visual acuity.

Title: Phase II study of thalidomide and radiation in children with newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of administering daily thalidomide concomitantly with radiation and continuing for up to 1 year following radiation in children with brain stem gliomas (BSG) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of thalidomide and to evaluate toxicities from chronic administration of thalidomide in this population. Thirteen patients (2-14 years old) with newly diagnosed BSG (12 patients) or GBM (one patient) were enrolled between July 1999 and June 2000. All patients received focal radiotherapy to a total dose of 5,580 cGy. Thalidomide was administered once daily beginning on the first day of radiation and continued for 12 months or until the patient came off study. The starting dose was 12 mg/kg (rounded down to the nearest 50 mg) and was increased by 20% weekly, if tolerated, to 24 mg/kg or 1,000 mg (whichever was lower). Advanced imaging techniques and urine and serum analysis for anti-angiogenic markers were performed in some patients in an attempt to correlate changes with clinical effect of therapy. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression. The median duration of therapy was 5 months (range 2-11 months). Nine patients came off study for progressive disease (PD), three patients due to toxicity and one patient withdrew consent. Several patients on this study required more extended courses of high dose steroids than would have been otherwise expected for this population due to significant peritumoral edema and necrosis. No consistent pattern emerged from the biologic correlative studies from 11 patients. However, advanced imaging with techniques such as MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were helpful in distinguishing growing tumor from treatment effect and necrosis in some patients. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5 months (range 2-11 months) and the median time to death (TTD) was 9 months (range 5-17 months). In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased.

Title: Early change in glucose metabolic rate measured using FDG-PET in patients with high-grade glioma predicts response to temozolomide but not temozolomide plus radiotherapy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to predict response to temozolomide vs. temozolomide plus radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) were studied. Patients with recurrent glioma received temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 weeks (n=8). Newly diagnosed patients received temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily plus radiotherapy 60 Gy/30 fractions over 6 weeks, followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day (Days 1-5 q28) starting 1 month after radiotherapy (n=11). [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline, and 7 and 19 weeks after initiation of temozolomide administration. Changes in glucose metabolic rate (MRGlu) and MRI response were correlated with patient survival. RESULTS: In the temozolomide-alone group, patients who survived>26 vs. <or=26 weeks showed a greater reduction in MRGlu measured at 7 weeks with median changes of -34% and -4%, respectively (p=0.02). PET responders, defined as a reduction in MRGlu>or=25%, survived longer than nonresponders with mean survival times of 75 weeks (95% CI, 34-115 vs. 20 weeks (95% CI, 14-26) (p=0.0067). In the small group of patients studied, there was no relationship between MRI response and survival (p=0.52). For patients receiving temozolomide plus radiotherapy, there was no difference in survival between PET responders and nonresponders (p=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Early changes in MRGlu predict response to temozolomide, but not temozolomide plus radiotherapy.

Title: How few cancer cells can be detected by positron emission tomography? A frequent question addressed by an in vitro study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) has gained widespread use in cancer diagnosis and treatment, but how many malignant cells are required for a tumour to be detected by PET? METHODS: Three human cancer cell lines [glioblastoma and two subtypes of small cell lung cancer (SCLC)] in concentrations from 10(4) to 10(7) were seeded on six-well plates or plastic tubes and treated with [(18)F]fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) in vitro. FDG retention was measured in a PET/CT scanner and in a calibrated well counter. The clinical situation was simulated using a cylinder phantom with a background concentration of FDG. RESULTS: The theoretical detection limit was found to be around 10(5) malignant cells. In a cylinder phantom the detection limit was increased by a factor of 10. The FDG retention by the glioblastoma cell line was significantly higher than the activity of the SCLC cell line. FDG retention measured by PET and a gamma counter was closely correlated to the number of cells and a linear relationship was found. DISCUSSION: The detection limit of PET is in the magnitude of 10(5) to 10(6) malignant cells. The experimental set-up was robust and well suited as a platform for further investigations of factors influencing the detection limit of PET.

Title: Optimization of semi-quantification in metabolic PET studies with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-methionine in the determination of malignancy of gliomas.
Abstract: The treatment of the glioma patient depends on the nature of the lesion and on the aggressiveness of the tumor. The management of gliomas continues to be a challenging task, because morphological neuroimaging techniques do not always differentiate them from nontumoral lesions or high grade tumors from low grade lesions. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers the possibility of the in vivo quantitative characterization of brain tumors. Despite decades of useful application of PET in the clinical monitoring of gliomas, no consensus has been reached on the most effective image analysis approach for providing the best diagnostic performance under heavy-duty clinical diagnostic circumstances. The main objective of the present study was to find and validate optimal semi-quantitative search strategies for metabolic PET studies on gliomas, with special regard to the optimization of those metabolic tracer uptake ratios most sensitive in predicting histologic grade and prognosis. 11C-Methionine (11C-Met, n = 50) and/or 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG, n = 33) PET measurements were performed in 59 patients with primary and recurrent brain gliomas (22 high grade and 37 low grade tumors) in order to correlate the biological behavior and 11C-Met/18F-FDG uptake of tumors. Data were analyzed by region-of-interests (ROI) methods using standard uptake value calculation. Different ROI defining strategies were then compared with each other for two of the most commonly used metabolic radiotracers, 18F-FDG and 11C-Met, in order to determine their usefulness in grading gliomas. The results were compared to histological data in all patients. Both ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the performance of 18F-FDG was superior to that of 11C-Met for most of the ratios. 18F-FDG is therefore suggested as the tracer of choice for noninvasive semi-quantitative indicator of histologic grade of gliomas. 11C-Methionine has been suggested as a complimentary tracer, useful in delineating the extent of the tumor. The best diagnostic performance was obtained by calculating the ratio of the peak 18F-FDG uptake of the tumor to that of white matter (p < 0.001; ANOVA). This metabolic tracer uptake ratio is therefore suggested as an easily obtained semi-quantitative PET indicator of malignancy and histological grade in gliomas.

Title: Incidence and patterns of neuraxis metastases in children with diffuse pontine glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We performed a retrospective study of patients with diffuse pontine glioma (DPG) who suffered neuraxis metastasis (NM) and characterized the incidence, clinical features, radiologic findings, and patterns of disease dissemination. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spine was used to assess NM. Some patients also underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (6 patients) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans (13 patients) to further evaluate areas of metastatic disease. Three patients had histologic confirmation of disease at the site of NM. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2003, 18 of 96 patients (17.3%) with DPG developed NM. The median age at diagnosis was 8 years (range, 4-17). All patients had adjuvant chemotherapy and/or focal radiotherapy at diagnosis. The NM occurred at a median of 15 months from diagnosis of DPG (range, 3-96). Three patterns of NM were seen on MRI of brain and spine in these patients; 8 (39%) had parenchymal (PM), 4 (22%) leptomeningeal (PM), 2 (11%) subependymal, and in 5 a combination of two or more patterns. The MRS and FDG-PET scan of suspected areas of metastatic disease was consistent with tumor in 6 of 6 and 12 of 13 patients who underwent these procedures respectively. Three patients also had histologic confirmation of malignant glioma at the site of NM. Despite salvage therapy, all 18 patients have died of disease at a median of 5 months (range, 0.5-20) from diagnosis of neuraxis spread. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the need for screening patients with DPG for NM at the time of recurrence.

Title: [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for targeting radiation dose escalation for patients with glioblastoma multiforme: clinical outcomes and patterns of failure.
Abstract: PURPOSE: [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging for brain tumors has been shown to identify areas of active disease. Radiation dose escalation in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme may lead to improved disease control. Based on these premises, we initiated a prospective study of FDG-PET for the treatment planning of radiation dose escalation for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty patients were enrolled. Patients were treated with standard conformal fractionated radiotherapy with volumes defined by MRI imaging. When patients reached a dose of 45-50.4 Gy, they underwent FDG-PET imaging for boost target delineation, for an additional 20 Gy (2 Gy per fraction) to a total dose of 79.4 Gy (n = 30). RESULTS: The estimated 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) for the entire group was 70% and 17%, respectively, with a median overall survival of 70 weeks. The estimated 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 18% and 3%, respectively, with a median of 24 weeks. No significant improvements in OS or PFS were observed for the study group in comparison to institutional historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation dose escalation to 79.4 Gy based on FDG-PET imaging demonstrated no improvement in OS or PFS. This study establishes the feasibility of integrating PET metabolic imaging into radiotherapy treatment planning.

Title: A novel brainstem tumor model: guide screw technology with functional, radiological, and histopathological characterization.
Abstract: OBJECT: Survival rates for high-grade brainstem tumors are approximately 10% and optimal therapy has yet to be determined. Development of a satisfactory brainstem tumor model is necessary for testing new therapeutic paradigms that may prolong survival. The authors report the technique, functional progression, radiological appearance, and histopathological features of a novel brainstem tumor model in rats. METHODS: Thirty female Fischer 344 rats were randomized (10 animals/group) to receive an injection of either 3 ml of 9L gliosarcoma cells (100,000 cells), 3 ml of F98 glioma cells (100,000 cells), or 3 ml of medium (Dulbecco modified Eagle medium) into the pontine tegmentum of the brainstem. Using a cannulated guide screw system implanted in the skull of the animal, rats in each group were injected at coordinates 1.4 mm to the right of the sagittal and 1 mm anterior to the lambdoid sutures, at a depth of 7 mm from the dura mater. The angle of the syringe during injection was anteflexed 5 degrees from the vertical. Postoperatively, the rats were evaluated for neurological deficits by using an automated rotarod test. High-resolution [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) fused with computerized tomography (CT) scans were acquired pre- and postoperatively through the onset of hemiparesis and correlated accordingly. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for survival and disease progression, and brains were processed postmortem for histopathological investigation. The 9L and F98 tumor cells grew in 95% of the animals in which they were injected and resulted in a statistically significant mean onset of hemiparesis of 16.5 6 0.56 days (p = 0.001, log-rank test), compared with animals in the control group, which had no neurological deficits by Day 45. The FDG-PET studies coregistered with CT scans demonstrated space-occupying brainstem lesions, and this finding was confirmed by histological studies. Animals in the control group showed no functional, radiological, or pathological signs of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Progression to hemiparesis was consistent in all tumor-injected animals, with predictable onset of symptoms occurring approximately 17 days postsurgery. The histopathological and radiological characteristics of the 9L and F98 brainstem tumors were comparable to those of aggressive primary human brainstem tumors. Establishment of this animal tumor model will facilitate the testing of new therapeutic paradigms for the treatment of these lesions.

Title: Glucose metabolism in brain tumours can be estimated using [18F]2-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and a population-derived input function scaled using a single arterialised venous blood sample.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess simplified methods for deriving input functions for estimating glucose metabolism using 18F-FDG-PET. Nine glioma patients underwent paired 18F-FDG-PET scans as part of a phase II study and the data used to estimate the metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu) using a population-derived input function (arterial data from 14 scans) scaled using a single arterial blood sample taken at 20 min. Paired studies were performed in four further glioma patients with stable disease at least four months following radiotherapy to determine whether scaling the population-derived input function using a 20-min arterialised venous or venous sample further simplified the method. The heated hand method was used to obtain arterialised venous blood that approximated arterial blood. In the 9 phase II glioma patients, there was a good, statistically significant correlation between the MRGlu values estimated using the individual arterial input functions and the single arterial sample scaled population-derived input functions (r(2)=0.88, p<0.001, n=36). Blood samples collected during three scans on two of the stable disease patients showed no significant difference between the arterialised venous and arterial plasma concentrations of 18F (p>0.1, n=15) when the degree of arterialisation of the blood was monitored and maintained using a thermocouple. A significant difference was found between the plasma arterial and venous levels of 18F. There was an excellent correlation between MRGlu estimated using an arterial input function and a population-derived input function scaled using a single arterialised venous blood sample (r(2)=0.98, n=12). The method was reproducible with less than 4.4% variation between repeat tumour scans. Therefore, a population-derived input function scaled using a single arterialised venous blood sample at 20 min can be used for estimating MRGlu using 18F-FDG PET in glioma patients.

Title: Does increased 18FDG uptake reflect malignant transformation of a low-grade glioma? A diagnostic dilemma.
Abstract: Benign gliomas of the brain show decreased uptake of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET). Malignant transformation is usually manifested by an increase of 18FDG uptake. A 45-year-old female has been followed up since 1987 by means of 18FDG-PET for a right hemispheric World Health Organization Grade II oligoastrocytoma. In 1996, increased epileptic activity was accompanied by increased 18FDG uptake within the temporal part of the tumor. After surgery, the epileptic seizures diminished. Histological examination of the resected tumor showed no change in the pathology when compared with the first biopsy. Localized temporal increase of 18FDG uptake was not associated with malignant progression. The decrease of seizure frequency might shed light on a putative connection of hyperglycolysis and epileptic discharges.

Title: 9-(4-[(18)F]Fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine.
Abstract: A potential approach to the treatment of diseases and genetic disorders in humans is gene therapy [PubMed]. This is a technique whereby the absent or malfunctioning gene is replaced by a working gene to produce an enzyme or a protein to correct the progression of disease. Noninvasive molecular imaging technologies play an important role in the fields of gene therapy by monitoring gene expression continuously in living animals (1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging (positon emission tomography (PET)/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) modalities have been applied for gene therapy of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, immunological, diabetic, and inherited diseases in small animals (2-10). These noninvasive imaging technologies allow quantitative assessments of the magnitude, location, and duration of the transgene expression. Gene therapy can be achieved either by ex vivo or in vivo methods. The gene can be delivered using a viral or nonviral vector, such as liposome and naked DNA. Retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and herpes simplex virus have been used as gene transfer vectors. Imaging transgene expression can help to optimize gene therapy. There are two imaging strategies, direct and indirect. Direct imaging uses a target-specific probe directly to the target. Indirect imaging involves coupling the target gene to a reporter gene, the gene expression of which can be tracked by a specific reporter gene probe. Currently, there are two approaches to image transgene expression, either by reporter enzyme using substrate probe or reporter receptor using receptor ligand probe. The enzymes include cytosine deaminase, beta-galactosidase, tyrosinase, and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) or its mutant, HSV1-sr36tk. The most extensively studied reporter enzyme gene is HSV1-tk (8, 11). The reporter receptors are dopamine D(2) receptor (D(2)R) (12) and somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (hSSTR2) (13). HSV1-tk is a commonly studied suicide gene for cancer therapy of glioma, prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma (10, 14). Suicide gene therapy is based on the enzymatic conversion of a nontoxic prodrug into a lethal drug by a transgene. Anti-HSV nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir, are converted to monophosphates by HSV thymidine kinase. The cellular enzymes converted the monophosphates to di- and triphosphates, which inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase. HSV1-tk has also been widely studied as a reporter gene. The HSV prodrugs have been explored for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging. The selective phosphorylation of the prodrug probes by HSV1-tk leads to trapping within the transduced cells and not significantly in the other cells. Many radiolabeled acycloguanosine and thymidine derivatives have been studied for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging in vitro, in small animals, and in humans (15). [(18)F]FHBG is a side-chain (18)F-labeled analog of penciclovir. [(18)F]FHBG has been evaluated in vitro and in small animals and is a potential imaging agent for gene expression using PET. Noninvasive molecular imaging of therapeutic HSV1-sr36tk suicide gene therapy in mice was demonstrated with [(18)F]FHBG and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging (14). Coexpression of the reporter gene HSV1-tk and a therapeutic gene is opening up further opportunities for gene therapy (15).

Title: Imaging progress of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase suicide gene therapy in living subjects with positron emission tomography.
Abstract: Molecular imaging of a suicide transgene's expression will aid the development of efficient and precise targeting strategies, and imaging for cancer cell viability may assess therapeutic efficacy. We used the PET reporter probe, 9-(4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl)guanine ([18F]FHBG) to monitor the expression of a mutant Herpes Simplex Virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39tk) in C6 glioma tumors implanted subcutaneously in nude mice that were repetitively being treated with the pro-drug Ganciclovir (GCV). [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), a metabolic tracer, was used to assess tumor cell viability and therapeutic efficacy. C6 glioma tumors stably expressing the HSV1-sr39tk gene (C6sr39) accumulated [18F]FHBG prior to GCV treatment. Significant declines in C6sr39 tumor volumes and [18F]FHBG and [18F]FDG accumulation were observed following 2 weeks of GCV treatment. However, 3 weeks after halting GCV treatment, the tumors re-grew and [18F]FDG accumulation increased significantly; in contrast, tumor [18F]FHBG concentrations remained at background levels. Therefore, [18F]FHBG can be used to detect tumors expressing HSV1-sr39tk, susceptible to regression in response to GCV exposure, and the effectiveness of GCV therapy in eradicating HSV1-sr39tk-expressing cells can be monitored by [18F]FHBG scanning. [18F]FHBG and [18F]FDG imaging data indicate that exposure of C6sr39 tumors to GCV causes the elimination of [18F]FHBG-accumulating C6sr39 cells and selects for re-growth of tumors unable to accumulate [18F]FHBG.

Title: [Value of 18F-FDG PET imaging in diagnosing tumor residue of intracranial glioma after surgery and radiotherapy].
Abstract: BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: It is difficult to diagnose tumor residue by CT/MRI after treatment. The application of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) to determine the suspected tumor residue after treatment has become a hot target in the study of radiotherapy. This study was designed to discuss the clinical value of (18)-FDG PET imaging in post-operative and post-radiotherapeutic intracranial glioma. METHODS: (18)F-FDG PET imaging was performed in 23 patients with post-operative and post-radio-therapeutic intracranial glioma, and compared with CT/MRI. The final diagnosis of tumor residue was proved by pathology or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Of 23 patients, 12 showed (18)F-FDG PET positive, and 11 showed negative,among which 3 were false negative. The accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET was 87.0% (20/23), significantly higher than 60.9% (14/23) of CT/MRI scan (P< 0.05). The diagnosis of tumor residue in 9 patients cannot be determined by CT/MRI, while 4 of these patients showed (18)F-FDG PET positive, and the other 5 showed (18)F-FDG PET negative. Eight of 23 patients diagnosed tumor residues by CT/MRI, showed (18)F-FDG PET positive,too. Six patients,diagnosed by CT/MRI as radioactive-disease sufferers, and PET indicated with low or deficient FDG metabolism, were proved to have radioactive diseases by follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG PET imaging has significant dominance in characterizing lesions,and differentiating tumor residue in post-operative and post-radiotherapeutic intracranial glioma. Combined with CT and MRI, it can provide both anatomical and functional information for treatment.

Title: 11C-methionine PET as a prognostic marker in patients with glioma: comparison with 18F-FDG PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the prognostic value of 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in glioma patients. METHODS: The study population comprised 47 patients with gliomas (19 glioblastoma, 28 others). Pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging, MET PET and FDG PET were performed within a time interval of 2 weeks in all patients. The uptake ratio and standard uptake values were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to determine significant prognostic factors. Ki-67 index was measured by immunohistochemical staining, and compared with FDG and MET uptake in glioma. RESULTS: Among the several clinicopathological prognostic factors, tumour pathology (glioblastoma or not), age (> or =60 or <60 years), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (> or =70 or <70) and MET PET (higher uptake or not compared with normal cortex) were found to be significant predictors by univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, tumour pathology, KPS and MET PET were identified as significant independent predictors. The Ki-67 proliferation index was significantly correlated with MET uptake (r=0.64), but not with FDG uptake. CONCLUSION: Compared with FDG PET in glioma, MET PET was an independent significant prognostic factor and MET uptake was correlated with cellular proliferation. MET PET may be a useful biological prognostic marker in glioma patients.

Title: Direct comparison of 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET in suspected recurrence of glioma: sensitivity, inter-observer variability and prognostic value.
Abstract: PURPOSE: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 11C-methionine (MET) PET imaging studies allow the investigation of metabolism and amino acid transport in brain tumours. Their (relative) usefulness and prognostic value in suspected recurrence or progression of primary brain tumours after previous therapy is an issue of debate. The aim of this study was to compare directly both radioligands in this setting. METHODS: Cerebral uptake of FDG and MET was determined sequentially on the same day in 30 patients (21 males, nine females; age 40.4+/-15.6 years), on average 4.0 years (range 0.1-18) after therapy for a primary brain tumour (23 grade II-IV astrocytomas, four oligodendrogliomas and three mixed oligo-astrocytomas). Images were acquired on a Siemens HR+ dedicated PET camera. Two observers scored FDG and MET scans independently. Semi-quantitative indices defined by the tumour (maximum)-to-background ratio were calculated based on manual ROI delineation and by using MET ROIs for FDG after automated co-registration. Patient follow-up was conducted until the last contact with inconspicuous clinical findings (average 41 months, range 12-62 months after PET) [(n=10)] or until death (n=20). RESULTS: Overall median survival was 15.0 months. MET showed pathologically increased uptake in 28/30 scans, and FDG in 17/30. The inter-observer agreement was 100% for MET and 73% for FDG. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, significant differences were found for both FDG (cut-off 0.8, log-rank p=0.007) and MET (cut-off 2.2, log-rank p=0.014). The combination of FDG and MET information resulted in the highest prognostic accuracy (p=0.003), while MET alone was the best prognostic predictor in the subgroup of patients with primary astrocytoma (n=23). CONCLUSION: FDG and MET PET studies provide complementary prognostic information in patients with suspected brain tumour recurrence or progression after primary therapy. MET is considered the single agent of choice in the evaluation of these patients because of its sensitivity and clearer delineation of the suspected recurrence.

Title: Value of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- L-tyrosine PET for the diagnosis of recurrent glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with recurrent gliomas depends on reliable and early diagnosis of tumour recurrence after initial therapy. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) often fail to differentiate between radiation- and tumour-induced contrast enhancement. Furthermore, absence of contrast enhancement, or even of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in PET, does not exclude recurrence. The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic value of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- L-tyrosine (FET) PET in recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with glioma (primary grading: 27=WHO grade IV, 16=grade III, 9=grade II, 1=grade I) and clinically suspected recurrence underwent FET PET scans 4-180 months after different treatment modalities. For semiquantitative evaluation, maximal SUV (SUVmax) and mean SUV within 80% and 70% isocontour thresholds (SUV80/SUV70) were evaluated and the respective ratios to the background (BG) were calculated. PET results were correlated with MRI/CT, clinical follow-up or biopsy findings. RESULTS: All patients presented with FET uptake, of varying intensity, in the area of the primary tumour after initial therapy. In the 42 patients with confirmed recurrence, there was additional distinct focal FET uptake with significantly higher values compared with those in the 11 patients without clinical signs of recurrence and showing only low and homogeneous FET uptake at the margins of the resection cavity. With respect to tumour grading, there was a slight but non-significant increase from WHO II (SUVmax/BG: 2.53+/-0.28) to WHO III (SUVmax/BG: 2.84+/-0.49) and WHO IV (SUVmax/BG: 3.55+/-1.07) recurrence. CONCLUSION: FET PET reliably distinguishes between post-therapeutic benign lesions and tumour recurrence after initial treatment of low- and high-grade gliomas.

Title: Hypoxia and glucose metabolism in malignant tumors: evaluation by [18F]fluoromisonidazole and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare glucose metabolism and hypoxia in four different tumor types using positron emission tomography (PET). (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) evaluates energy metabolism, whereas the uptake of (18)F-labeled fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) is proportional to tissue hypoxia. Although acute hypoxia results in accelerated glycolysis, cellular metabolism is slowed in chronic hypoxia, prompting us to look for discordance between FMISO and FDG uptake. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-nine patients (26 with head and neck cancer, 11 with soft tissue sarcoma, 7 with breast cancer, and 5 with glioblastoma multiforme) who had both FMISO and FDG PET scans as part of research protocols through February 2003 were included in this study. The maximum standardized uptake value was used to depict FDG uptake, and hypoxic volume and maximum tissue:blood ratio were used to quantify hypoxia. Pixel-by-pixel correlation of radiotracer uptake was performed on coregistered images for each corresponding tumor plane. RESULTS: Hypoxia was detected in all four patient groups. The mean correlation coefficients between FMISO and FDG uptake were 0.62 for head and neck cancer, 0.47 for breast cancer, 0.38 for glioblastoma multiforme, and 0.32 for soft tissue sarcoma. The correlation between the overall tumor maximum standardized uptake value for FDG and hypoxic volume was small (Spearman r = 0.24), with highly significant differences among the different tumor types (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia is a general factor affecting glucose metabolism; however, some hypoxic tumors can have modest glucose metabolism, whereas some highly metabolic tumors are not hypoxic, showing discordance in tracer uptake that can be tumor type specific.

Title: Comparison of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with glucose transporter-1 expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer.
Abstract: To clarify the biological significance of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) accumulation in patients with cancer, we assessed the relationships between 18F-FDG uptake and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and lung cancer. We obtained FDG PET images and measured standardized uptake values (SUVs) of primary tumours in 13 patients with brain glioma and 25 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. After surgery, portions of respected tumours were obtained, and the proliferation rate was measured as proliferation index (per cent of (S+G2+M)/(G0+G1+S+G2+M)) using DNA flow cytometry. The expression of GLUT-1 in a tumour was evaluated by using immunostaining. We classified GLUT-1 expression as grade 0 (no positive cell), grade 1 (< 10% cells positive), grade 2 (11-50% cells positive) and grade 3 (51-100% cells positive). Based on the expression of GLUT-1, cases with grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 showed SUVs of 6.1 +/- 2.8, 5.0 +/- 3.2, 8.3 +/- 3.3 and 10.4 +/- 6.6, respectively (P < 0.05). Non-small-cell lung cancer showed higher FDG uptake (SUV, 8.5 +/- 5.1) and higher GLUT-1 expression (grade, 2.0 +/- 1.0) than did brain glioma (SUV, 4.7 +/- 2.5; grade, 0.8 +/- 0.8). Based on the total number of cases, SUVs did not relate to proliferation index (r = 0.19). In non-small-cell lung cancer, SUVs did not correlate with proliferation index, whereas in glioma, SUVs were strongly related to proliferation index (r = 0.79, P < 0.01). In conclusion, FDG uptake generally correlated with GLUT-1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer and glioma. In the case of glioma, FDG uptake also indicated increased cellular proliferation, which was not demonstrated in non-small-cell lung cancer.

Title: Monitoring individual response to brain-tumour chemotherapy: proton MR spectroscopy in a patient with recurrent glioma after stereotactic radiotherapy.
Abstract: Since antineoplastic activity varies, sensitive methods for individual assessment of efficacy are needed. We demonstrate the clinical value of MR spectroscopy in monitoring chemotherapy in a patient with recurrent glioma after stereotactic radiotherapy. Diagnostic imaging before and after chemotherapy included contrast-enhanced MRI, single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS), (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ((1)H SI), and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET). A significant decrease in choline signal intensity was observed 2 months after chemotherapy indicating tumour chemosensitivity, in line with tumour shrinkage on MRI and decreased uptake of FDG. Assessment of early response by MRS may help to improve treatment protocols in other patients.

Title: Multicentric glioblastoma multiforme determined by positron emission tomography: a case report.
Abstract: The actual incidence of true multicentric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) varies between 2.4 and 4.9% of all GBMs. True multicentric tumors are described as widespread lesions in different lobes or hemispheres, which cannot be explained by spreading along the cerebrospinal fluid or blood pathways. We present here a case of multicentric GBM identified with positron emission tomography. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old woman with sudden onset headaches, balance problems, and one episode of syncope was diagnosed as having an irregular, contrast-enhancing, space-occupying lesion in the left-temporal-parietal region on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tissue diagnosis was confirmed as GBM, and she received stereotactic radiosurgery using the Leksell Gamma Knife (Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA). A 3-month, follow-up, MRI scan showed a remarkable decrease in the size of the contrast-enhancing area that was targeted during radiosurgery. A suspicious area of enhancement was detected on the right side, although no surrounding edema was evident. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scanning revealed a large irregular neoplasm extending from the inferior left-temporal lobe into the deep parietal lobe with extremely intense FDG uptake, suggesting a very aggressive tumor. A smaller lesion was also discovered in the deep right-frontal lobe, representing a second neoplastic focus. The patient refused any further treatment. CONCLUSION: PET scans, in conjunction with MRI scans, allow for the best possible and most comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plans.

Title: Uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in human monocyte-macrophages in vitro.
Abstract: The fact that fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) accumulates in inflammatory lesions as well as in tumours reduces the diagnostic specificity of positron emission tomography (PET) in oncology. The aim of this study was to characterise the uptake of [(18)F]FDG in isolated human monocyte-macrophages (HMMs) in vitro in comparison with that in human glioblastoma (GLI) and pancreatic carcinoma cells (PAN). The purity of HMM preparations was determined by immunohistochemical staining and their functional integrity was assessed by long-term incubation with iodine-131 acetylated bovine serum albumin. [(18)F]FDG uptake in HMMs was quantified as percent of whole [(18)F]FDG activity per well (% ID) or as % ID in relation to total protein mass. [(18)F]FDG uptake in HMMs significantly increased with culture duration, yielding 7.5%+/-0.9% (% ID/100 micro g) at day 14. Stimulation by lipopolysaccharide further enhanced [(18)F]FDG uptake in HMMs by a factor of 2. [(18)F]FDG uptake significantly decreased with increasing glucose concentration in the medium. Radio-thin layer chromatography of intracellular metabolites revealed that [(18)F]FDG was trapped by HMMs mainly as [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate and [(18)F]FDG-1,6-diphosphate. [(18)F]FDG uptake was in the range of uptake values measured in GLI and PAN. By accumulating [(18)F]FDG in a manner analogous to uptake by tumour cells, activated HMMs may contribute to the [(18)F]FDG uptake values measured by PET in neoplasms.

Title: CL1-SR39: A noninvasive molecular imaging model of prostate cancer suicide gene therapy using positron emission tomography.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We developed a prostate cancer tumor model capable of being noninvasively imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) based on expression of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) reporter gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The androgen independent, metastatic prostate cancer cell lines CL1 and CL1-GFP were stably transfected with the mutant HSV1-tk gene pcDNA3.1/pCMV-sr39tk, which has increased ability to phosphorylate penciclovir. The presence of the sr39tk gene product was analyzed by Western blot analysis and relative thymidine kinase enzyme activity was assessed by a functional thymidine kinase enzyme activity assay. Subcutaneous and orthotopic CL1 and CL1-SR39 tumor xenografts were established in SCID mice. The ability to image CL1-SR39 was assessed using fluorodeoxyglucose and F-penciclovir ( F-FHBG) micro-PET (a rodent PET scanner). To investigate the systemic distribution of intratumoral sr39tk injections established CL1 tumors were transiently injected with first generation adenoviral vectors carrying the sr39tk gene under control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter Ad-CMV-HSV1-sr39tk and imaged using micro-PET. RESULTS: Transfection of sr39tk into CL1 cells was successful. CL1-SR39 thymidine kinase enzyme activity was greater than twice the activity of the glioma cell line C6-SR39 control and above the threshold necessary for micro-PET detection. Fluorodeoxyglucose micro-PET in SCID mice was positive for CL1 and CL1-SR39 tumors. Selective micro-PET of subcutaneous CL1-SR39 tumors was done using F-FHBG. Micro-PET imaging after systemic and intratumoral injection of Ad-CMV-HSV1-sr39tk revealed significant systemic transgene leakage with significant hepatic expression of sr39TK protein. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular based imaging of sr39tk transfected prostate cancer tumors and adenoviral delivered HSV1-tk suicide gene therapy based on the selective conversion and intracellular trapping of F-FHBG by sr39tk is feasible. Potential applications include noninvasive monitoring of the location, duration and intensity of gene constructs, which may contribute to the safety of clinical gene therapy protocols, and noninvasive imaging of the prostate cancer xenograft response to experimental therapy.

Title: Usefulness of 11C-methionine PET in the evaluation of brain lesions that are hypo- or isometabolic on 18F-FDG PET.
Abstract: The fact that some brain tumors show hypo- or isometabolism on fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) has caused problems in the detection of primary or recurrent tumors and in the differentiation from benign lesions. We investigated the usefulness of carbon-11 methionine PET in characterizing brain lesions under these conditions. 11C-methionine PET was performed in 45 patients with brain lesions (in 34 for initial diagnosis and in 11 for detection of recurrence) that showed hypo- or isometabolism compared with normal brain tissue on FDG PET. Ten minutes after the injection of 555-740 MBq of 11C-methionine, attenuation-corrected brain images were obtained with a dedicated PET scanner. The brain lesions comprised 24 gliomas, five metastatic brain tumors, four meningiomas, two other brain tumors and ten benign lesions (including three cases of cysticercosis, two cases of radiation necrosis, one tuberculous granuloma, one hemangioma, one benign cyst, and one organizing infarction). Proliferative activity was measured using the Ki-67 immunostaining method in glioma tissues. Thirty-one of 35 brain tumors (89% sensitivity) showed increased 11C-methionine uptake despite iso- or hypometabolism on FDG PET. By contrast, all ten benign lesions showed decreased or normal 11C-methionine uptake (100% specificity). Twenty-two of 24 gliomas (92%) showed increased 11C-methionine uptake, the extent and degree of which exceeded 18F-FDG uptake, and the 11C-methionine uptake correlated with the proliferation index (r=0.67). The mean (+/-SD) uptake ratios of glioma to normal brain on FDG and 11C-methionine PET were 0.92+/-0.34 and 2.54+/-1.25, respectively. All metastatic tumors except one showed intense 11C-methionine uptake in the entire tumor or in the peripheral margin of the tumor. In meningiomas, 11C-methionine uptake showed a variable increase. In conclusion, brain lesions that show hypo- or isometabolism on FDG PET can be detected and differentiated with high sensitivity and good contrast using 11C-methionine PET. 11C-methionine PET can provide additional information when used in combination with FDG PET in the evaluation of these patients.

Title: Evaluation of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma by use of positron emission tomography with.
Abstract: We present a case of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) in a patient with temporal lobe seizures. Imaging sequences included MR, and results of positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [11C]-methionine (Met) tracers revealed a hypermetabolic region equivalent or nearly equivalent to normal cerebral cortex, suggesting that the tumor might have malignant potential. Histopathologic findings indicated low-grade glioma. The mechanism for glucose hypermetabolic activity of PXA is not clear; however, the positive findings obtained from FDG-PET may not always indicate the degree of malignancy associated with PXA.

Title: Synthesis and evaluation of [18F]1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid to image brain tumors.
Abstract: We have developed a new tumor-avid amino acid, 1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC), labeled with 18F for nuclear medicine imaging. METHODS: [18F]FACBC was prepared with high specific activity (no carrier added [NCA]) and was evaluated for its potential in tumor localization. A comparative study was performed for [18F]FACBC and [18F]2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in which the uptake of each agent in 9L gliosarcoma (implanted intracerebrally in Fisher 344 rats) was measured. In addition, the first human PET study of [18F]FACBC was performed on a patient with residual glioblastoma multiforme. Quantitative brain images of the patient were obtained by using a Siemens 921 47-slice PET imaging system. RESULTS: In the rat brain, the initial level of radioactivity accumulation after injection of [18F]FACBC was low (0.11 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) at 5 min and increased slightly to 0.26 %ID/g at 60 min. The tumor uptake exhibited a maximum at 60 min (1.72 %ID/g), resulting in a tumor-to-brain ratio increase of 5.58 at 5 min to 6.61 at 60 min. In the patient, the uptake of [18F]FACBC in the tumor exhibited a maximum concentration of 146 nCi/mL at 35 min after injection. The uptake of radioactivity in the normal brain tissue was low, 21 nCi/mL at 15 min after injection, and gradually increased to 29 nCi/mL at 60 min after injection. The ratio of tumor to normal tissue was 6 at 20 min after injection. The [18F]FACBC PET scan showed intense uptake in the left frontal region of the brain. CONCLUSION: The amino acid FACBC can be radiofluorinated for clinical use. [18F]FACBC is a potential PET tracer for tumor imaging.

Title: A comparative study of thallium-201 SPET, carbon-11 methionine PET and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the differentiation of astrocytic tumours.
Abstract: Thallium-201, carbon-11 methionine (MET) and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have all been used to assess brain tumours. The aim of this study was to determine which of these tracers are of use for evaluating the histological grade and the extent of astrocytoma. 201Tl single-photon emission tomography (SPET), MET positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG PET were all performed in 23 patients (13 men, 10 women) with newly diagnosed astrocytic tumours [seven with astrocytoma (grade II), ten with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and six with glioblastoma (grade IV)]. The 201Tl uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a lesion-to-normal region count ratio. Both MET and FDG uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a semiquantitative analysis using the standardized uptake value. 201Tl uptake was found to increase in rank order with histological grade and was significantly different among the three groups (grade II: 1.51+/-0.36; grade III: 2.58+/-1.50; grade IV: 7. 65+/-3.84). MET uptake in grade II (1.49+/-0.44) was also significantly lower than that in both grade III (3.29+/-1.44) and grade IV (3.20+/-0.92). FDG uptake was not significantly different among the three groups (grade II: 2.90+/-0.45; grade III: 3.86+/-1. 56; grade IV: 3.57+/-0.83). No significant correlation was observed between 201Tl uptake and either MET uptake or FDG uptake. In most patients, the extent of the increased MET uptake was the largest while that of the increased FDG uptake was the smallest. In patients with positive 201Tl uptake, the extent of the 201Tl uptake was equal to or smaller than that of gadolinium enhancement. For evaluation of histological grade of astrocytic tumours. 201Tl is therefore considered to be useful though the 201Tl uptake in some grade III astrocytomas was not different from that in grade II astrocytomas. MET was found to be highly useful for detecting astrocytomas, for differentiating between benign and malignant astrocytomas, and for evaluating the extent of astrocytomas; however, it was not sufficiently useful permit evaluation of the histological grade. FDG was not found to be useful either for evaluating the histological grade or for differentiating between benign and malignant astrocytomas.

Title: The value of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the 3-D radiation treatment planning of malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of positron emission tomography using the glucose analogue fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) on the delineation of the target volume in three-dimensional radiation treatment planning of primary brain tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 18 patients with histologically proven (8x biopsy, 10x subtotal resection) primary brain tumors (8 astrocytomas grade III, one mixed glioma grade III, and 9 glioblastomas), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA and FDG-PET were performed in radiation treatment position within the same week. A computer program was developed for fusion of the PET and MR images. On corresponding axial slices, FDG uptake was compared to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted and to signal hyperintensity in T2-weighted MR images. Based on PET and MRI data, three-dimensional treatment planning was performed. All patients underwent linear accelerator (LINAC) radiotherapy. RESULTS: In MRI, all tumors and the surrounding edema were visible as hyperintense lesions in the T2-weighted images. 17/18 tumors showed contrast enhancement. In FDG-PET, 16 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal white matter, whereas only 8/18 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal gray matter. White matter edema was associated with decreased FDG uptake in all patients. The area of increased FDG uptake correlated closely with contrast enhancement, only in one case the volume of increased FDG uptake was larger than the area of contrast enhancement. Mean tumor volumes obtained by MRI T1 + Gd, T2, and PET were 30, 106, and 10 ml, respectively. Survival was comparable to data in the literature with a 1-year survival of 39% and a median survival of 310 days. CONCLUSION: Only in a minority of patients did FDG-PET provide additional information for radiation treatment planning. This is mainly caused by the high intensity of FDG uptake in normal brain tissue. PET may be of greater value in the definition of regions that should obtain a radiation dose boost.

Title: Assessment of malignancy of glioma by positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and single photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 chloride.
Abstract: The histological diagnosis and proliferative potential measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling index (LI) were correlated with preoperative CT and contrast-enhanced, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and 201T1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 43 patients with various grades of glioma. 201T1 SPECT had slightly higher sensitivity to tumours with BrdU LI > or = 5% (showing 10/10) than 18F-FDG PET (7/8 tumours). 18F-FDG PET was better for identifying tumours of BrdU LI < 1% (13/15) than 201T1 SPECT (13/22). Accumulation of 201T1 in the tumour was slightly different from contrast enhancement on CT and/or MRI, and gave "false-positive" results in some low-grade gliomas. However, 201T1 SPECT, which is available in many hospitals and may cost less, provided useful information to supplement that from CT and MRI.

Title: Dexamethasone treatment and plasma glucose levels: relevance for fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake measurements in gliomas.
Abstract: Dexamethasone (DEX) is frequently used in brain tumor management. This study investigated the effect of DEX treatment and plasma glucose levels on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in patients with malignant gliomas (16 glioblastoma, 3 anaplastic astrocytoma). METHODS: Fifteen DEX-treated patients (mean relative dose 0.23 +/- 0.15 mg(-1) x kg(-1) x day(-1), range 0.07-0.53), four patients not treated with DEX and nine healthy subjects were studied using PET and FDG. PET data obtained from tumors and the contralateral cortex were fitted to a standard two-tissue compartment model. The FDG transport and phosphorylation rates, distribution volume (DV), steady-state accumulation (Ki), deoxyglucose metabolism (R), plasma volume as well as standardized uptake values (SUVs) and tumor-to-brain ratios were determined. In addition, the tumor size was estimated from the maximal area of contrast-enhancing tumor on computed cranial tomography (CCT) scans or MRI. RESULTS: FDG uptake was depressed in the contralateral cortex of patients and was related to tumor size. With increasing relative DEX dose, a decrease in the DV of tumors (linear regression p = 0.021) and in the DV (p = 0.109) and plasma volume (p = 0.010) of contralateral cortex was found. R, Ki and SUVs in tumors and contralateral cortex were not related to the relative DEX dose. With increasing plasma glucose levels, differential decreases in Ki and SUVs in tumors (p = 0.057 and p = 0.733, respectively) and contralateral cortex (p = 0.001 and p = 0.029, respectively) were observed. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that DEX affects FDG uptake in malignant gliomas through interaction with cerebral blood vessels and extracellular space, whereas FDG metabolism in tumors is not influenced substantially. This is of practical importance for patients having serial brain tumor imaging for treatment evaluation because patients may receive different DEX doses at different time points in the course of their disease. By contrast, the plasma glucose level must be considered a confounding variable when SUVs, tumor-to-brain ratios or Ki are used for treatment evaluation.

Title: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy guided brain tumor resection: differentiation between recurrent glioma and radiation change in two diagnostically difficult cases.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is often difficult to differentiate a recurrent glioma from the effects of post-operative radiotherapy by means of conventional neurodiagnostic imaging. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), that allows in vivo measurements of the concentration of brain metabolites such as choline-containing phospholipids (Cho), may provide in vivo biochemical information helpful in distinguishing areas of tumor recurrence from areas of radiation effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients who had undergone resection and post-operative radiotherapy for a cerebral glioma became newly symptomatic. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the intravenous infusion of contrast material, and in one case, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), could not differentiate between the possibilities of recurrent glioma and radiation effect. The patients underwent 1H-MRSI prior to reoperation and the 1H-MRSI results were compared to histological findings originating from the same locations. RESULTS: A high Cho signal measured by 1H-MRSI was seen in areas of histologically-proven dense tumor recurrence, while low Cho signal was present where radiation changes predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation between the recurrence of a cerebral glioma and the effects of post-operative irradiation was achieved using 1H-MRSI in these two patients whose conventional neurodiagnostic imaging was equivocal for such a distinction. Where these two conditions are present, metabolite images from 1H-MRSI, such as that based on Cho, can be co-registered with other imaging modalities such as MRI and may also be integrated with functional MRI or functional PET within a multimodal imaging-guided surgical navigation system to assure maximal resection of recurrent tumor while minimizing the risk of added neurological damage.

Title: 11C-methionine and 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a tool for diagnosis of cerebral glioma and monitoring after brachytherapy with 125I seeds.
Abstract: Forty-six patients with suspected brain tumors were investigated by positron emission tomography (PET). Using 11C-methionine PET, the spatial extent of increased uptake in gliomas was larger than that of contrast enhancement on CT/MR images in 67% or the same in 33%. Ten of 46 patients treated with brachytherapy for low-grade gliomas were also investigated with 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. One year after seed implantation, the glucose metabolism had not changed, but the decline of methionine uptake was significant. In conclusion, 11C-methionine PET may improve tumor delineation and, following brachytherapy, provides more information on the therapeutic effects than FDG.

Title: 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and survival of patients with suspected recurrent malignant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: After intensive initial radiation therapy for malignant glioma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) cannot distinguish tumor progression from radiation injury. METHODS: The authors studied the prognostic value of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in 55 patients with malignant glioma for whom MRI obtained after initial surgery and radiation therapy demonstrated enlarging, enhancing lesions consistent with either tumor progression or radiation necrosis. Forty patients (73%) had an initial diagnosis of Grade 4 malignant glioma and 15 (27%) had Grade 3 malignant glioma. The FDG-PET scans were graded visually on a four-level scale at the time of acquisition. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the FDG-PET score was a significant predictor of survival time after FDG-PET scanning (P = 0.005). Median survival was 10 months for patients with FDG-PET scores of 2 or 3 (glucose uptake > or = adjacent cortex) and 20 months for those with scores of 0 or 1 (glucose uptake < adjacent cortex). In multivariate proportional hazards analysis, the FDG-PET score was a significant predictor of survival (P = 0.019) in a model that included patient age, recurrence number, and FDG-PET score. There was no significant difference in the FDG-PET score hazard ratio for patients with Grade 3 or 4 tumors at initial diagnosis, first or later suspected recurrence, initial photon irradiation given with standard fractions or hyperfractionation, or stereotactic irradiation prior to FDG-PET scanning. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that FDG-PET scanning has prognostic value in a cohort limited to patients with suspected recurrent high grade glioma.

Title: Impact of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the clinical management of patients with glioma.
Abstract: The past decade has seen the identification of many clinical settings in the treatment of primary brain tumors in which information from fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) might be useful, if not essential, to therapeutic formulation. FDG-PET is currently used at referral centers in the management of primary brain tumors. The clinical pattern of FDG-PET use was assessed and its value compared to other information sources in clinical decision making. The clinical records of 75 glioma patients who were evaluated by FDG-PET were reviewed. The range of circumstances in which FDG-PET was employed included: pretherapeutic baseline studies for monitoring the effect of a therapy (1% of all cases), mapping of hypermetabolic regions before surgery or biopsy (2%), mapping of hypermetabolic regions before radiotherapy (2%), postsurgical evaluation for residual tumor (2%), assessment of the malignancy of a mass as a substitute for biopsy (11%), and distinguishing between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor (87%). Other sources of information that contributed to the therapeutic management of patients included: gadolinium-enhanced MRI, contrast-CT, and clinical findings.

Title: [Clinical value of positron emission tomography (PET) in oncologic questions: results of an interdisciplinary consensus conference. Schirmerreschaft der Deutschen Gesellschaft for Nuklearmedizin].
Abstract: AIM: The purpose of the present paper is to assess clinical value of PET in oncology on the basis of published studies. METHODS: Clinical value of PET in oncology was evaluated by a panel of recognized experts in the framework of an interdisciplinary consensus conference. On the basis of PET studies, well documented in the international literature, the value of PET for solving clinical questions was classified according to the following categories (classes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3): "appropriate" (1a), "mostly acceptable" (1b), "helpful" (2a), "value as yet unknown" (2b), "useless" (3). RESULTS: 2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) acts as the radiopharmaceutical of choice for PET in clinical oncology. PET is indicated (1a) for diagnosing relapse in high grade glioma (FDG) or low grade glioma (C-11 methionine or F-18 fluorotyrosine), differential diagnosis of solitary peripheral pulmonary nodules in high risk patients and for diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. PET may be clinically used (1b): In "low-grade" glioma, search for unknown primary in head and neck tumors, suspicion of relapse in non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (NSCBC) and colorectal carcinoma, lymphnode staging in NSCBC, pancreatic carcinoma, muscle invasive bladder carcinoma and testicular cancer. Staging of Hodgkin's disease (HD, stage I/II vs III), early therapy control in patients with a residual mass or suspicion of relapse in HD and in high grade NHL, lymph node staging and search for distant metastases in malignant melanoma (Breslow > 1.5 mm), search for lymph node or distant metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer with elevated hTG and a negative radioiodide whole body scan. Many further indications are emerging, but are not yet sufficiently well documented in the literature. For most indications beside scientific studies, an individual cost benefit utility evaluation by the responsible physician is recommended. CONCLUSION: Metabolic imaging of PET provides for many principle advantages compared to conventional anatomically based cross sectional imaging. For routine use in oncology a detailed assessment of specific efficiency of PET is indicated.

Title: Independent thallium-201 accumulation and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in glioma.
Abstract: SPECT with 201TI is an effective procedure for evaluating the malignancy of glioma. Our goal was to investigate the diagnostic relevance of both 201TI SPECT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and the relation between 201TI uptake and glucose metabolism in glioma using comparative SPECT and PET studies. METHODS: Thallium-201 SPECT and FDG dynamic PET studies were performed in 20 patients with untreated glioma (5 with glioblastoma, 5 with anaplastic glioma, 10 with low-grade glioma). Thallium-201 uptake in the tumor was estimated using the 201TI index, defined as the ratio of 201TI uptake in the tumor to that in the contralateral normal brain on SPECT images obtained 15 min after intravenous injection. We measured regional glucose metabolic parameters, including rate constants and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (rCMRgl), in the tumor. We then compared the regional 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters with the histologic characteristics, malignancy and computed tomographic/ magnetic resonance imaging findings. In addition, we investigated the correlation between the 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters. RESULTS: Thallium-201 SPECT showed abnormal 201TI uptake in all patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic glioma. Thallium-201 indices of glioblastoma (202.6 +/- 22.1%) and anaplastic glioma (176.6% +/- 26.6%) were significantly higher than that for low-grade glioma (106.7% +/- 13.8%). The rCMRgl value of glioblastoma (17.6 +/- 3.5 mumole/100 g/min) was also significantly higher than that for low-grade glioma (10.8 +/- 4.5 mumole/100 g/min), although rCMRgl showed a large variability in both high- and low-grade glioma. Rate constants of FDG kinetics had no correlation with histological grade of glioma. Some patients with high-grade glioma, however, showed false-negative results with FDG-PET because of high normal brain uptake of FDG. Conversely, most low-grade glioma could not be localized by 201TI SPECT. There was no correlation between the 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters. CONCLUSION: Thallium-201 indices and rCMRgl values for glioblastoma were higher than those for low-grade glioma. Thallium-201 uptake in the tumor may be independent of increased glucose transport or metabolism. Thallium-201 SPECT and FDG-PET are complementary in the diagnosis of glioma, although 201TI SPECT is more significantly correlated with the malignancy of glioma.

Title: [Positron-emission tomography: role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) imaging in oncology].
Abstract: There is a renewed interest in positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) since the development of large field of view cameras and the capability of regional distribution of 18FDG. This method may help solve three types of problems in clinical oncology: tumor diagnosis and extension assessment, prediction of treatment response and follow-up (diagnosis of recurrences and complications). The aim of this paper is to review the literature in this field. This technique is mostly used for brain, lung, rectal and breast tumors as well as for sarcomas. It is possible to diagnose an anaplastic transformation of a low grade glioma since 18FDG uptake correlates with the histological grade. 18FDG plays another important role in the evaluation of the brain tumor response to treatment and of the secondary effects or sequelae of this treatment. This technique is also useful in breast carcinomas: diagnosis in the case of a dense breast, detection of lymph nodes or other metastases which could modify the strategy. One of the most established roles of 18FDG PET is the diagnosis of rectal tumor recurrences. Furthermore, future results will probably confirm its usefulness in lung carcinoma, for the diagnosis and for treatment evaluation. Lastly, it plays an important role in soft tissue sarcomas at all stages of diagnosis and treatment. The results of the literature still have to be completed. However, if the capability of predicting tumor response to treatment is confirmed, this method will play an important role in patient management and will modify treatment strategies.

Title: [Kinetic analysis of glucose metabolism in meningiomas--comparison with malignant gliomas].
Abstract: We measured kinetic rate constants and glucose metabolic rate (kinetic-rCMRGl) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), oxygen metabolic rate (rCMRO2) and autoradiographic rCMRGl (arg-rCMRGl), in patients with meningioma. Ten patients including one recurrent case, two males and eight females aged from 44 to 71 years with a mean age of 54 years old, were studied prior to surgical interventions. Histological diagnosis was as follows: seven cases of meningothelial type, two cases of angiomatous type and one fibrous type. For quantitative analysis, regions of interest (ROI) on PET images were delineated on the tumor and the contralateral gray matter in comparison with eight cases with malignant gliomas (five cases of malignant astrocytoma and three cases of glioblastoma, aged from 14 to 70 years with a mean age of 41 years old). Hemocirculation of the tumor was exceedingly higher than that of the contralateral gray matter, which corresponded to neuroradiological findings of abundant tumor vessels. Low rOEF implicated an excessive blood flow beyond oxygen demand of the tumor. The raised metabolic rate (rCMRO2/rCMRGl) suggested rather aerobic glycolysis as compared with malignant gliomas. The kinetic rate constants of tracer transport from blood to brain (k1), reverse transport from brain to blood (k2), and phosphorylation (k3) were analyzed according to the three compartment model of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Tumor k1 and k2 values markedly increased in all examined cases, suggesting high permeability due to lack of blood-brain barrier and an abundant blood supply.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Effects of hyperglycemia on FDG uptake in human brain and glioma.
Abstract: This study evaluates the effects of hyperglycemia on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the human brain and in brain tumors. METHODS: We performed glucose loading during FDG PET studies in nine patients with brain tumors (eight gliomas and one brain metastasis) and one with resected glioma. Two FDG PET scans were obtained in all cases within 1 wk in a control state and with glucose loading by intravenous infusion of 10% glucose solution. Serial arterial blood sampling was performed in all cases to obtain fractional uptake of FDG normalized by the plasma integral uptake of radioactivity (FU). RESULTS: In all nine patients with brain tumors, the tumor was depicted more clearly with glucose loading than in the control state. Glucose loading decreased FU in the cerebral cortex (54.2% +/- 13.8%) nearly in inverse proportion to the plasma glucose level, while the tumors showed a decrease (42.5% +/- 15.6%), resulting in an increased tumor-to-cortex ratio by 26.0% +/- 5.7%. Fractional uptake in the cerebellum, white matter and the edematous area also decreased by glucose loading (53.9% +/- 13.2%, 49.6% +/- 10.3% and 34.9% +/- 9.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the different effects of hyperglycemia on normal brain tissue and on tumor, suggesting that glucose loading may be a valuable adjunct to FDG PET to enhance detection of recurrent or residual brain tumors.

Title: Thallium-201 SPECT and positron emission tomography equal predictors of glioma grade and recurrence.
Abstract: Quantitative indexes based on regions of interest ratios from preoperative thallium-201 SPECT and F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were compared for their ability to predict the histological grade of cerebral gliomas. Of the five different ratios used to determine the index for each PET scan, the ratio of tumour versus ipsilateral hemisphere in the same plane as the tumour showed the most significant correlation with glioma grade (p < 0.001). A large study of 62 thallium-201 SPECT scans showed equally good correlation with glioma grade (p < 0.0005). The use of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of tumour recurrence had 100% sensitivity in this series, while PET scans had 90.9% sensitivity. Patients with a rate of change in serial thallium indexes of 0.475 +/- 0.278 per month survived 5.93 +/- 2.25 months from onset of index increase, while those with little change in the index (0.069 +/- 0.063 per month) survived 17.93 +/- 5.25 months from onset of index increase. Results indicate thallium-201 SPECT correlates well with tumour grade and is equally efficient as PET in screening for glioma recurrence.

Title: FDG-PET as a prognostic indicator in radiochemotherapy of glioblastoma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We performed a prospective cohort study in a homogeneous patient group with proven glioblastoma who received uniform therapy to determine the prognostic value and clinical correlates of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET at different stages of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma, aged 52 +/- 9 years and with Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of at least 50, were treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy (nimustine), and radiotherapy. They were followed prospectively for 2 years. Clinical data (e.g., tumor progression, performance status, and survival) were recorded and glucose metabolism was measured with PET and FDG before and during radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival of all patients was 13 months and four patients were alive 24 months after surgery. All tumors were hypermetabolic compared with normal white matter. A metabolic index was calculated as the ratio of maximum residual tumor metabolism to contralateral normal brain metabolism. It was of prognostic value for patient survival and tumor recurrence already in the first postoperative and all following PET studies and was correlated with the KPS. Reduction of contralateral brain metabolism was more closely related to prognosis than the tumor metabolism proper. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the prognostic relevance of metabolically active residual tumor tissue after surgical resection.

Title: Recurrent malignant glioma: detection with 131I labeled monoclonal antibody G-22, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: A 45-year-old man with suspected recurrent malignant glioma was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and 131I labeled monoclonal antibody G-22 (G-22) scan. Following Gadolinium-DTPA, a TI-weighted spin echo image (TR 500 msec, TE 20 msec) demonstrated a large mass with an irregular margin in the left temporo-parietal area. An 18F labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET study demonstrated marked accumulations in the left temporo-parietal area. Serial 131I-G-22 scintigraphy was obtained for a week after the injection. The uptake was most increased on the 2nd day after the injection. 131I G-22 was specific for tumor-associated antigens.

Title: Acute changes in glucose uptake after treatment: the effects of carmustine (BCNU) on human glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: Sequential positron emission tomographic scans with [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG) were performed on 6 patients with glioblastoma multiforme who were treated with adjuvant BCNU. Scans were acquired before and 24 hours after BCNU. All patients had prior brain irradiation. Ratios between the maximal tumor FDG uptake and the contralateral white matter FDG uptake, the glucose uptake ratio, were determined. Percent changes in the glucose uptake ratio between the baseline scan and the 24 hour post-treatment scan were of prognostic significance. Patients with the largest percent changes in FDG uptake had the shortest survival. In contrast, neither the baseline glucose uptake ratio nor the visual tumor grade accurately predicted length of survival.

Title: Clinical value of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and L-methyl-11C-methionine for diagnosis of recurrent brain tumor and radiation injury.
Abstract: We studied 15 patients clinically suspected to have recurrent brain tumor or radiation injury, using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) and L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-Met). PET with 11C-Met (Met-PET) clearly delineated the extent of recurrent brain tumor as focal areas of increased accumulation of 11C-Met, and was useful for early detection of recurrent brain tumor. PET with 18FDG (FDG-PET) showed focal 18FDG-hypermetabolism in one patient with malignant transformation of low grade glioma, and demonstrated its usefulness for evaluation of malignant transformation. 18FDG-hypometabolism was observed in all patients with radiation injury, but was also found in one patient with recurrent malignant brain tumor. 11C-Met uptake in 3 patients with radiation injury was similar to that of the normal cortical tissue. FDG-PET can be used to initially exclude recurrent brain tumor which is seen as 18FDG-hypermetabolism. The combined use of Met-PET in addition to FDG-PET can improve the accuracy of differentiation of recurrent brain tumor with 18FDG-hypometabolism from radiation injury.

Title: Clinical evaluation of a high-resolution (2.6-mm) positron emission tomography.
Abstract: The intrinsic resolution of the Donner 600-crystal positron emission tomograph (PET 600) is 2.6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) in-plane and 6 mm FWHM axially. More than 100 patients with glioma, radiation necrosis, Alzheimer disease, or epilepsy have been studied with this system. Approximately 1 million events are acquired in 15 minutes, starting 1 hour after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Normal structures as small as the superior colliculi and the external capsule have been resolved. Improved separation of the cortical ribbon from adjacent white matter has allowed more accurate determination of cortical metabolic rate. In two of 15 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent glioma, the PET 600 images showed tumor uptake that was not apparent on a lower-resolution study. A high-activity orbiting transmission source with electronic collimation allows accurate, short-duration transmission measurements to be made after radiopharmaceutical administration. The anatomic detail seen on the transmission images can be used for reproducible patient positioning with an accuracy of 1-2 mm perpendicular to the image plane. These findings demonstrate the practicality and clinical effectiveness of high-resolution positron emission tomography.

Title: [Prognostic significance of regional blood flow, blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and metabolic rates of oxygen and glucose as measured by positron emission tomography in patients with gliomas].
Abstract: We tested clinical significance of hemocirculatory and metabolic values and ratios as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) in twenty-three patients with cerebral gliomas. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and metabolic rates of oxygen (rCMRO2) and glucose (rCMRGl) were measured prior to treatment using PET with 15O2, C15O, 15O2, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose tracers. For the quantitative analysis, regions of interest were delineated on tumor regions including peak activity, the contralateral gray and white matter. The regional values and the ratios of tumor/gray matter and tumor/white matter were compared to performance status (PS) according to the five functional grades system which are defined by the Japan Society for Cancer Therapy, tumor progression-free time (PFT), survival time (ST) from the time of the PET study, regardless of type of therapy. As with rCMRGl, the tumor values and the ratios of tumor/gray matter and tumor/white matter correlated significantly with PS (tumor/gray: p less than 0.05, tumor/white: p less than 0.01). Both the gray rCBF and the tumor/gray rCBF ratio had close relation with PS and/or PFT (p less than 0.05). The gray matter rCMRO2 and the tumor/gray matter rCMRO2 ratio related significantly (gray matter: p less than 0.01, tumor/gray: p less than 0.05) to each clinical parameter of PS, PFT, and ST. These indicate that values and ratios as determined by PET can be useful in predicting the prognosis of glioma patients.

Title: [Radiochemotherapy-related changes in the brain parenchyma of glioma patients evaluated repeatedly by C15O2, C15O, 15O2, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET].
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of radiochemotherapy on blood flow and metabolism using C15O2, C15O, 15O2, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional, external radiotherapy (180-200 cGy/5 fractions/week) using 60Co or a 10 MV linear accelerator was given in conjunction with chemotherapy of nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) and tegafur (FT-207) in eight patients with gliomas. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), oxygen consumption (rCMRO2), and glucose consumption (rCMRG1) were longitudinally examined before the treatment, and at an early stage (within one month) and a late stage (three to thirty-one months with a mean of 12 months) after radiochemotherapy. Contralateral gray and white matter to the tumor was selected as regions of interest (ROIs), because these portions were irradiated with larger doses compared to other brain parenchymal regions through parallel opposing fields. Maximum doses to the ROIs varied between 20 and 61 Gy. Calculated as a function of time-dose-fractionation, nominal standard doses (NSD) ranged from 566 to 1729 ret, and 344 to 1062 neuret; equivalent doses (ED) equaled 432 to 1327 rads. At the early stage, rCBF and rCBV increased in the contralateral gray and white matter; gray matter rOEF decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 by a paired-t test) from that of the pretreatment study, probably due to decompression of the tumor bulk and radiochemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Positron emission tomography in the detection of malignant degeneration of low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The management of low-grade gliomas represents a challenge to the physician as a significant proportion may undergo malignant degeneration to a high-grade tumor. We present the positron emission tomography (PET) scans, using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), of 12 patients who have histological and/or clinical evidence of malignant degeneration of a low-grade glioma. Each scan displays a focal area of hypermetabolism similar to that of malignant gliomas which arise de novo. Three patients also underwent PET scanning prior to malignant degeneration. When the initial scan is compared with the postmalignant degeneration study, a difference in tumoral glucose uptake can be recognized. A region previously shown to be hypometabolic develops focal hypermetabolism as malignant changes evolve. This study displays the utility of FDG-PET in the evaluation of malignant degeneration of low-grade gliomas. The knowledge that a neoplasm has altered its biological behavior may influence subsequent therapeutic options. If these findings can be confirmed in larger series and by other investigators, it is possible that FDG-PET may be adopted as one of the diagnostic tools for guiding the management of low-grade gliomas.

Title: Positron emission tomography in patients with glioma. A predictor of prognosis.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been performed using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose in 29 adult subjects with primary brain tumors. Seventy-two percent of the patients were treated previously. The glucose metabolic state in the lesions was increased in 16 patients, and was normal or decreased in 13 patients. The hypermetabolic tumors tended to behave in a more malignant fashion. Patients with hypermetabolic tumors had a median survival of 7 months after PET scan, compared to 33 months for those with hypometabolic lesions. Among the high-grade glioma patients, the PET results separated them into a good prognosis group (hypometabolic, with 78% 1-year survival) and a poor prognosis group (hypermetabolic, with a 29% 1-year survival after PET). These results suggest that glucose metabolic studies may provide an independent measure of the aggressiveness of a brain tumor, and may supplement pathologic grading.

Title: Non selective transport of [11C-methyl]-L-and D-methionine into a malignant glioma.
Abstract: Images obtained by X-ray CT, brain scintigraphy (99mTc-DTPA) and positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C-methyl]-L- and D-methionine in a case of malignant glioma are presented, showing good agreement of PET and CT findings, in particular nearly identical localization of L- and D-methionine accumulation, whereas the blood brain barrier is only slightly disturbed. In a greater number of patients the amount of accumulated stereoisomers do not differ on a significant level, indicating that a raised transport rate mediated by a carrier of low stereospecifity seems to contribute substantially to the increased uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine in human brain tumors. Several cerebral functions and diseases have been studied with positron emission tomography (PET), which represents a clinical tool for visualizing metabolic activities rather than morphologic lesions (Reivich et al. 1985; Mazziotta et al. 1986). With regard to the malignancy of brain tumors DiChiro et al. (1982, 1984, 1985a, b) showed a correlation between tumor grade and its glucose metabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. An increased uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine into tumor tissue has also been described (Hubner et al. 1980; Bergstrom et al. 1983; Kubota et al. 1984; Meyer et al. 1985; Schober et al. 1986b). Bustany et al. (1981, 1983, 1985a, b, 1986) developed a model for quantitative determination of protein synthesis, postulating that methionine incorporation into protein in brain tumors correlates with grade of malignancy. We do not believe that the uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine mainly reflects protein synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Relation between tissue nature and (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose kinetics evaluated by dynamic positron emission tomography in human brain tumors.
Abstract: Using dynamic positron emission tomographic (PET) scans, kinetic rate constants in the (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) model and glucose consumption rate were measured in human brain tumors. In the tumor tissue, all rate constants were higher on the average in the glioma grade IV and the non-glial tumor groups. The k*3 showed wide deviation in the glioma grade IV group. Discrepancy was found between the k*3 and the glucose consumption rate in several cases. The k*1 correlated with the neovascularity in tumors confirmed at angiography. Analysis of the rate constants might be useful for interpreting tumor nature and predicting its malignancy.

Title: Issues in the in vivo measurement of glucose metabolism of human central nervous system tumors.
Abstract: Over 150 cases of central nervous system tumors have been studied with positron emission tomography using fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) as a tracer. From this material 100 consecutive cases of cerebral glioma have been reviewed and analyzed. The results show a strong correlation of tumor grade with glycolytic rate, with visual "hot spots" present in all high-grade neoplasms and in only four low-grade tumors. The quantitative accuracy is limited by three basic factors. First, the measurement of tissue uptake, as compared with the parent technique, autoradiography, is more difficult because detection must be done outside the body. Effects such as scattered radiation and self-attenuation introduce errors unless properly corrected. A more serious problem when measuring small structures, such as a rim-shaped high-grade glioma, is the limited spatial resolution. The most advanced scanner, the Neuro-PET, has a resolution of 6 to 7 mm. Second, corrections are needed for backflow, including free tracer at the time of the scan that will return to the blood and "trapped" tracer that will backflow because of the presence of phosphatase. These corrections are calculated from the blood activity using nominal rate constants for 18FDG. Our study found no significant alteration in rate constants between normal and tumoral tissue. Finally, a lumped constant is needed to correct for kinetic differences between 18FDG and glucose. If there is a change in the mechanism of either membrane transport or the hexokinase reaction, the lumped constant may change. However, measurements of actual glucose utilization in tissue culture lines from six patients support the 18FDG results.
