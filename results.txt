Title: CSF-based liquid biopsy pointing to a diagnosis of diffuse glioma in a patient with supposed neurodegenerative disorder.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The differential diagnosis of brain diseases becomes challenging in cases where imaging is not sufficiently informative, and surgical biopsy is impossible or unacceptable to the patient. METHODS: An elderly patient with progressive short-term memory loss and cognitive impairment presented with a normal brain CT scan, a brain FDG-PET that indicated symmetrical deterioration of the white matter in the frontal lobes, and inconclusive results of a molecular marker analysis of suspected dementia in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI suggested the diagnosis of lower grade glioma. The patient refused surgical biopsy. In order to investigate whether somatic mutations associated with gliomas existed, we performed a "liquid biopsy" by the targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from his CSF. RESULTS: Deep sequencing of the cfDNA from CSF revealed somatic mutations characteristically found in gliomas, including mutations of the TP53 (Arg282Trp), BRAF (Val600Glu), and IDH1 (Arg132His) genes. The patient is currently treated with temozolomide, and his clinical and MRI findings suggest the stabilization of his disease. CONCLUSION: Neurological patients may benefit from liquid biopsy diagnostic work-up as it can reveal therapeutically targetable mutations.

Title: Metabolic delineation of IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma surgical anatomy: how to plan the tumor extent of resection.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard for preoperative planning of glioblastoma (GBM) surgery. However, recent data on the use of (11) C-methionine positron emission tomography ((11)[C]-MET PET) suggest its role in providing additional information beyond MRI. The purpose of this study is to establish if there is a correlation between anatomical and metabolic data. METHODS: We retrieved all GBM cases treated from 2014 to January 2021. Preoperative MRI (Enhancing Nodule -EN-, FLAIR and Total Tumor Volume -TTV-), PET volumes and histological samples obtained from the different tumor regions were evaluated to analyze potential correlations between anatomical, metabolic and pathological data. RESULTS: 150 patients underwent surgery for GBM and 49 of these were also studied preoperatively with (11)[C]-MET PET; PET volume was evaluated in 47 patients. In 33 patients (70.21%) preoperative (11)[C]-MET PET volume > preoperative EN volume and in 11 (23.4%) preoperative (11)[C]-MET PET volume > preoperative TTV. We found a significant correlation between preoperative TTVs and PET volumes (p = 0.016) as well as between preoperative EN volumes and PET volumes (p = < 0.001). Histologically, 109 samples were evaluated. ENs samples exhibited the conventional GBM morphology while samples from the FLAIR regions showed white matter tissue, with focal to diffuse tumor cells infiltration and areas of reactive astrogliosis. CONCLUSION: We submit that (11)[C]-MET PET volume generally overcome EN. The presence of neoplastic cells confirm these metabolic data. It should be considered in the surgical planning to achieve a Supra Total Resection (SupTR).

Title: Contribution of nuclear medicine to the diagnosis and management of primary brain tumours.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool that can help physicians manage primary brain tumours at diagnosis and follow-up. In this context, PET imaging is used with three main types of radiotracers: (18)F-FDG, amino acid radiotracers, and (68)Ga conjugated to somatostatin receptor ligands (SSTRs). At initial diagnosis, (18)F-FDG helps to characterize primary central nervous system (PCNS) lymphomas and high-grade gliomas, amino acid radiotracers are indicated for gliomas, and SSTR PET ligands are indicated for meningiomas. Such radiotracers provide information on tumour grade or type, assist in directing biopsies and help with treatment planning. During follow-up, in the presence of symptoms and/or MRI modifications, the differential diagnosis between tumour recurrence and post-therapeutic changes, in particular radiation necrosis, may be challenging, and there is strong interest in using PET to evaluate therapeutic toxicity. PET may also contribute to identifying specific complications, such as postradiation therapy encephalopathy, encephalitis associated with PCNS lymphoma, and stroke-like migraine after radiation therapy (SMART) syndrome associated with glioma recurrence and temporal epilepsy, originally illustrated in this review. This review summarizes the main contribution of PET to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of brain tumours, specifically gliomas, meningiomas, and primary central nervous system lymphomas.

Title: High-Grade Glioma Radiation Therapy and Reirradiation Treatment Planning Using Translocator Protein Positron Emission Tomography With (18)F-GE-180.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-GE-180 shows high tumor-to-brain contrast in high-grade glioma (HGG), even in areas without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Until now, the benefit of (18)F-GE-180 PET in primary radiation therapy (RT) and reirradiation (reRT) treatment planning for patients with HGG has not been assessed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The possible benefit of (18)F-GE-180 PET in RT and reRT planning was retrospectively evaluated through post hoc spatial correlations of PET-based biological tumor volumes (BTVs) with conventional MRI-based consensus gross tumor volumes (cGTVs). To find the ideal threshold for BTV definition in RT and reRT treatment planning, tumor-to-background activity thresholds of 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 were applied. Spatial overlap of PET- and MRI-based tumor volumes was measured by the Sorensen-Dice coefficient (SDC) and the conformity index (CI). Additionally, the minimal margin to include the entire BTV into the expanded cGTV was determined. RESULTS: Thirty-five primary RT and 16 reRT cases were examined. BTV1.6, BTV1.8, and BTV2.0 were significantly larger than corresponding cGTV volumes in primary RT (median volumes: 67.4, 50.7, and 39.1, respectively, vs 22.6 cm(3); P < .001, P < .001, and P = .017, respectively; Wilcoxon test) and reRT cases (median volumes: 80.5, 55.0, and 41.6, respectively, vs 22.7 cm(3); P = .001, P = .005, and P = .144, respectively; Wilcoxon test). BTV1.6, BTV1.8, and BTV2.0 showed low but increasing conformity with cGTVs in the primary RT (SDC: 0.51, 0.55, and 0.58, respectively; CI: 0.35, 0.38, and 0.41, respectively) and reRT setting (SDC: 0.38, 0.40, and 0.40, respectively; CI: 0.24, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively). The minimal margin required to include the BTV within the cGTV was significantly smaller in the RT versus the reRT setting for thresholds 1.6 and 1.8 but not significantly different for threshold 2.0 (median margin: 16, 12, and 10, respectively, vs 21.5, 17.5, and 13 mm, respectively; P = .007, P = .031, and P = .093, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-GE-180 PET provides valuable information in RT treatment planning for patients with HGG. (18)F-GE-180-based BTVs with a threshold of 2.0 were most consistent in primary and reRT.

Title: The impact of brain lesions on health-related quality of life in patients with WHO CNS grade 3 or 4 glioma: a lesion-function and resting-state fMRI analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: In glioma patients, tumor development and multimodality therapy are associated with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is largely unknown how different types and locations of tumor- and treatment-related brain lesions, as well as their relationship to white matter tracts and functional brain networks, affect HRQoL. METHODS: In 121 patients with pretreated gliomas of WHO CNS grades 3 or 4, structural MRI, O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and self-reported HRQoL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20) were obtained. Resection cavities, T1-enhancing lesions, T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, and lesions with pathologically increased FET uptake were delineated. Effects of tumor lateralization, involvement of white matter tracts or resting-state network nodes by different types of lesions and within-network rs-fMRI connectivity were analyzed in terms of their interaction with HRQoL scores. RESULTS: Right hemisphere gliomas were associated with significantly less favorable outcomes in physical, role, emotional and social functioning, compared with left-sided tumors. Most functional HRQoL scores correlated significantly with right-sided white-matter tracts involvement by T2/FLAIR hyperintensities and with loss of within-network functional connectivity of right-sided nodes. Tumors of the left hemisphere caused significantly more communication deficits. CONCLUSION: In pretreated high-grade gliomas, right hemisphere lesions are associated with reduced HRQoL scores in most functional domains except communication ability, compared to tumors of the left hemisphere. These relationships are mainly observed for T2/FLAIR lesions involving structural and functional networks in the right hemisphere. The data suggest that sparing the right hemisphere from treatment-related tissue damage may improve HRQoL in glioma patients.

Title: 18 F-FMISO PET of an Intracranial Tuberculoma : A Great Mimicker.
Abstract: Solitary intracranial tuberculomas are rare and frequently misdiagnosed as brain tumors. We report a case of intracranial tuberculous granuloma mimicking a high-grade glioma with avid uptake on 18 F-fluoromisonidazole PET/CT. It has been believed that hypoxia exists within the tuberculosis granuloma, and that this hypoxic environment causes Mycobacterium tuberculosis to lie dormant and asymptomatic infection to occur. This hypoxic and necrotic condition inside tuberculous granuloma may lead to high accumulation of 18 F-fluoromisonidazole in this case.

Title: Late Pseudoprogression: A Potential Pitfall in 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT for Glioma.
Abstract: Recognition of pseudoprogression in malignant glioma is one of the major challenges in the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Somatostatin receptors were overexpressed on the surface of the most high-grade glioma. The corresponding PET imaging is used for planning radiation and radionuclide therapy. However, the heterogeneity of somatostatin receptors distribution is mainly responsible for the lack of specificity. Here we reported a case of a 35-year-old man with mesenchymal oligodendroglioma operation and radiotherapy 19 months ago. 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET showed intense uptake near the operation region, which has been misinterpreted as tumor recurrence.

Title: (11)C-methionine PET imaging characteristics in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and relationship to survival and H3 K27M mutation status.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET imaging characteristics in patients with paediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and correlate them with survival and H3 K27M mutation status. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 98 children newly diagnosed with DIPG who underwent (11)C-MET PET. PET imaging characteristics evaluated included uptake intensity, uniformity, metabolic tumour volume (MTV), and total lesion methionine uptake (TLMU). The maximum, mean, and peak of the tumour-to-background ratio (TBR), calculated as the corresponding standardised uptake values (SUV) divided by the mean reference value, were also recorded. The associations between the PET imaging characteristics and clinical outcomes in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and H3 K27M mutation status were assessed, respectively. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, imaging characteristics significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS included a higher uniformity grade, higher TBRs, larger MTV, and higher TLMU. In multivariate analysis, larger MTV at diagnosis, shorter symptom duration, and no treatment were significantly correlated with shorter PFS and OS. The PET imaging features were not correlated with H3 K27M mutation status. CONCLUSION: Although several imaging features were significantly associated with PFS and OS, only MTV, indicating the size of the active tumour, was identified as a strong independent prognostic factor.

Title: A Comparison of PET Tracers in Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: Humans with high-grade gliomas have a poor prognosis, with a mean survival time of just 12-18 months for patients who undergo standard-of-care tumor resection and adjuvant therapy. Currently, surgery and chemoradiotherapy serve as standard treatments for this condition, yet these can be complicated by the tumor location, growth rate and recurrence. Currently, gadolinium-based, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) serves as the predominant imaging modality for recurrent high-grade gliomas, but it faces several drawbacks, including its inability to distinguish tumor recurrence from treatment-related changes and its failure to reveal the entirety of tumor burden (de novo or recurrent) due to limitations inherent to gadolinium contrast. As such, alternative imaging modalities that can address these limitations, including positron emission tomography (PET), are worth pursuing. To this end, the identification of PET-based markers for use in imaging of recurrent high-grade gliomas is paramount. This review will highlight several PET radiotracers that have been implemented in clinical practice and provide a comparison between them to assess the efficacy of these tracers.

Title: Hotspot on 18F-FET PET/CT to Predict Aggressive Tumor Areas for Radiotherapy Dose Escalation Guiding in High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: The standard therapy strategy for high-grade glioma (HGG) is based on the maximal surgery followed by radio-chemotherapy (RT-CT) with insufficient control of the disease. Recurrences are mainly localized in the radiation field, suggesting an interest in radiotherapy dose escalation to better control the disease locally. We aimed to identify a similarity between the areas of high uptake on O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) before RT-CT, the residual tumor on post-therapy NADIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the area of recurrence on MRI. This is an ancillary study from the IMAGG prospective trial assessing the interest of FET PET imaging in RT target volume definition of HGG. We included patients with diagnoses of HGG obtained by biopsy or tumor resection. These patients underwent FET PET and brain MRIs, both after diagnosis and before RT-CT. The follow-up consisted of sequential brain MRIs performed every 3 months until recurrence. Tumor delineation on the initial MRI 1 (GTV 1), post-RT-CT NADIR MRI 2 (GTV 2), and progression MRI 3 (GTV 3) were performed semi-automatically and manually adjusted by a neuroradiologist specialist in neuro-oncology. GTV 2 and GTV 3 were then co-registered on FET PET data. Tumor volumes on FET PET (MTV) were delineated using a tumor to background ratio (TBR) >/= 1.6 and different % SUVmax PET thresholds. Spatial similarity between different volumes was performed using the dice (DICE), Jaccard (JSC), and overlap fraction (OV) indices and compared together in the biopsy or partial surgery group (G1) and the total or subtotal surgery group (G2). Another overlap index (OV') was calculated to determine the threshold with the highest probability of being included in the residual volume after RT-CT on MRI 2 and in MRI 3 (called "hotspot"). A total of 23 patients were included, of whom 22% (n = 5) did not have a NADIR MRI 2 due to a disease progression diagnosed on the first post-RT-CT MRI evaluation. Among the 18 patients who underwent a NADIR MRI 2, the average residual tumor was approximately 71.6% of the GTV 1. A total of 22% of patients (5/23) showed an increase in GTV 2 without diagnosis of true progression by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Spatial similarity between MTV and GTV 2 and between MTV and GTV 3 were higher using a TBR >/= 1.6 threshold. These indices were significantly better in the G1 group than the G2 group. In the FET hotspot analysis, the best similarity (good agreement) with GTV 2 was found in the G1 group using a 90% SUVmax delineation method and showed a trend of statistical difference with those (poor agreement) in the G2 group (OV' = 0.67 vs. 0.38, respectively, p = 0.068); whereas the best similarity (good agreement) with GTV 3 was found in the G1 group using a 80% SUVmax delineation method and was significantly higher than those (poor agreement) in the G2 group (OV'= 0.72 vs. 0.35, respectively, p = 0.014). These results showed modest spatial similarity indices between MTV, GTV 2, and GTV 3 of HGG. Nevertheless, the results were significantly improved in patients who underwent only biopsy or partial surgery. TBR >/= 1.6 and 80-90% SUVmax FET delineation methods showing a good agreement in the hotspot concept for targeting standard dose and radiation boost. These findings need to be tested in a larger randomized prospective study.

Title: A Systematic Review of Amino Acid PET Imaging in Adult-Type High-Grade Glioma Surgery: A Neurosurgeon's Perspective.
Abstract: Amino acid PET imaging has been used for a few years in the clinical and surgical management of gliomas with satisfactory results in diagnosis and grading for surgical and radiotherapy planning and to differentiate recurrences. Biological tumor volume (BTV) provides more meaningful information than standard MR imaging alone and often exceeds the boundary of the contrast-enhanced nodule seen in MRI. Since a gross total resection reflects the resection of the contrast-enhanced nodule and the majority of recurrences are at a tumor's margins, an integration of PET imaging during resection could increase PFS and OS. A systematic review of the literature searching for "PET" [All fields] AND "glioma" [All fields] AND "resection" [All fields] was performed in order to investigate the diffusion of integration of PET imaging in surgical practice. Integration in a neuronavigation system and intraoperative use of PET imaging in the primary diagnosis of adult high-grade gliomas were among the criteria for article selection. Only one study has satisfied the inclusion criteria, and a few more (13) have declared to use multimodal imaging techniques with the integration of PET imaging to intentionally perform a biopsy of the PET uptake area. Despite few pieces of evidence, targeting a biologically active area in addition to other tools, which can help intraoperatively the neurosurgeon to increase the amount of resected tumor, has the potential to provide incremental and complementary information in the management of brain gliomas. Since supramaximal resection based on the extent of MRI FLAIR hyperintensity resulted in an advantage in terms of PFS and OS, PET-based biological tumor volume, avoiding new neurological deficits, deserves further investigation.

Title: Sequential and Hybrid PET/MRI Acquisition in Follow-Up Examination of Glioblastoma Show Similar Diagnostic Performance.
Abstract: Both positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion (DSC-PWI), are crucial for treatment monitoring of patients with high-grade gliomas. In clinical practice, they are usually conducted at separate time points. Whether this affects their diagnostic performance is presently unclear. To this end, we retrospectively reviewed 38 patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma (IDH wild-type) and suspected tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Only patients who received both a PET-MRI (where DSC perfusion was acquired simultaneously with a FET-PET) and a separate MRI exam (including DSC perfusion) were included. Tumors were automatically segmented into contrast-enhancing tumor (CET), necrosis, and edema. To compare the simultaneous as well as the sequential DSC perfusion to the FET-PET, we calculated Dice overlap, global mutual information as well as voxel-wise Spearman correlation of hotspot areas. For the joint assessment of PET and MRI, we computed logistic regression models for the differentiation between true progression (PD) and treatment-related changes (TRC) using simultaneously or sequentially acquired images as input data. We observed no significant differences between Dice overlap (p = 0.17; paired t-test), mutual information (p = 0.18; paired t-test) and Spearman correlation (p = 0.90; paired t-test) when comparing simultaneous PET-MRI and sequential PET/MRI acquisition. This also held true for the subgroup of patients with >14 days between exams. Importantly, for the diagnostic performance, ROC analysis showed similar AUCs for differentiation of PD and TRC (AUC simultaneous PET: 0.77; AUC sequential PET: 0.78; p = 0.83, DeLong's test). We found no relevant differences between simultaneous and sequential acquisition of FET-PET and DSC perfusion, also regarding their diagnostic performance. Given the increasing attention to multi-parametric assessment of glioma treatment response, our results reassuringly suggest that sequential acquisition is clinically and scientifically acceptable.

Title: Clinical applications and prospects of PET imaging in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas.
Abstract: PET imaging using radiolabeled amino acids in addition to MRI has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the clinical management of patients with brain tumors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PET studies in glioma patients with a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH). A considerable fraction of these tumors typically show no contrast enhancement on MRI, especially when classified as grade 2 according to the World Health Organization classification of Central Nervous System tumors. Major diagnostic challenges in this situation are differential diagnosis, target definition for diagnostic biopsies, delineation of glioma extent for treatment planning, differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumor progression, and the evaluation of response to alkylating agents. The main focus of this review is the role of amino acid PET in this setting. Furthermore, in light of clinical trials using IDH inhibitors targeting the mutated IDH enzyme for treating patients with IDH-mutant gliomas, we also aim to give an outlook on PET probes specifically targeting the IDH mutation, which appear potentially helpful for response assessment.

Title: Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutation and histologic grade in IDH wild-type histological lower-grade gliomas: The value of perfusion-weighted image, diffusion-weighted image, and (18)F-FDG-PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERTp) mutation is an unfavorable prognostic factor in isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) histologically lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA), which was incorporated as a key component in the WHO 2021 classification of IDHwt LGA, replacing histologic grades in the WHO 2016 classification. The purpose of this study was to identify the imaging characteristics predictive of TERTp mutations in IDHwt LGA. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. This single-center study retrospectively included 59 patients with pathologically confirmed IDHwt LGA with known TERTp mutation status. In addition to clinical information and morphological characteristics, semi-quantitative imaging biomarkers such as the tumor-to-normal ratio (T/N ratio) on (18)F-FDG-PET, normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC), and histogram parameters from normalized relative cerebral blood volume (nrCBV) maps were compared between (a) TERTp-wildtype and TERTp-mutant tumors or (b) grade II and grade III astrocytoma. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the conventional imaging findings, T/N ratio on FDG-PET, nrCBV or ADC histogram metrics between IDHwt LGA with TERTp mutations and those without. Grade III IDHwt astrocytomas exhibited significantly higher nrCBV values, T/N ratio and lower ADC parameters than grade II IDHwt astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IDHwt LGA, T/N ratio, nrCBV values and nADC may be surrogate markers for predicting histologic grade, but are not useful for predicting TERTp mutations.

Title: High grade glioma recurrence presenting as extensive tumor thrombus and simultaneous pulmonary metastasis revealed on (18)F-FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: Extensive tumor thrombus and simultaneous pulmonary metastasis in glioma patient is rare. Herein, we reported a 45-year-old woman with extensive tumor thrombus in sagittal sinus and sigmoid sinus with obvious enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed extensive tumor thrombus in sagittal sinus, sigmoid sinus andinternal jugular vein, and simultaneous left hilar lymph node andpulmonary metastasis. Our case demonstrated the value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for correctly identifying tumor thrombus,detecting extent of tumor thrombus and distant metastasis in high grade glioma patients.

Title: 18F-FET-PET imaging in high-grade gliomas and brain metastases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To provide a summary of the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FET-PET in the management of patients with high-grade brain gliomas or metastases from extracranial primary malignancies. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched for studies that reported on diagnostic test parameters in radiotherapy planning, response assessment, and tumour recurrence/treatment-related changes differentiation. Radiomic studies were excluded. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool and the GRADE approach. A bivariate, random-effects model was used to produce summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies with a total of 1206 patients/lesions were included in the analysis. For radiotherapy planning of glioma, the pooled proportion of patients from 3 studies with (18)F-FET uptake extending beyond the 20 mm margin from the gadolinium enhancement on standard MRI was 39% (95% CI, 10-73%). In 3 studies, (18)F-FET-PET was also shown to be predictive of early responders to treatment, whereas MRI failed to show any prognostic value. For the differentiation of glioma recurrence from treatment-related changes, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of TBR(max) 1.9-2.3 from 6 studies were 91% (95% CI, 74-97%) and 84% (95% CI, 69-93%), respectively. The respective values for brain metastases from 4 studies were 82% (95% CI, 74-88%) and 82% (95% CI, 74-88%) using TBR(max) 2.15-3.11. CONCLUSION: While (18)F-FET shows promise as a complementary modality to standard-of-care MRI for the management of primary and metastatic brain malignancies, further validation with standardized image interpretation methods in well-designed prospective studies are warranted.

Title: (18)F-FET PET radiomics-based survival prediction in glioblastoma patients receiving radio(chemo)therapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantitative image analysis based on radiomic feature extraction is an emerging field for survival prediction in oncological patients. (18)F-Fluorethyltyrosine positron emission tomography ((18)F-FET PET) provides important diagnostic and grading information for brain tumors, but data on its use in survival prediction is scarce. In this study, we aim at investigating survival prediction based on multiple radiomic features in glioblastoma patients undergoing radio(chemo)therapy. METHODS: A dataset of 37 patients with glioblastoma (WHO grade 4) receiving radio(chemo)therapy was analyzed. Radiomic features were extracted from pre-treatment (18)F-FET PET images, following intensity rebinning with a fixed bin width. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for variable selection, aiming at the identification of the most relevant features in survival prediction. Random forest classification and prediction algorithms were optimized on an initial set of 25 patients. Testing of the implemented algorithms was carried out in different scenarios, which included additional 12 patients whose images were acquired with a different scanner to check the reproducibility in prediction results. RESULTS: First order intensity variations and shape features were predominant in the selection of most important radiomic signatures for survival prediction in the available dataset. The major axis length of the (18)F-FET-PET volume at tumor to background ratio (TBR) 1.4 and 1.6 correlated significantly with reduced probability of survival. Additional radiomic features were identified as potential survival predictors in the PTV region, showing 76% accuracy in independent testing for both classification and regression. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FET PET prior to radiation provides relevant information for survival prediction in glioblastoma patients. Based on our preliminary analysis, radiomic features in the PTV can be considered a robust dataset for survival prediction.

Title: Alterations in white matter fiber density associated with structural MRI and metabolic PET lesions following multimodal therapy in glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: In glioma patients, multimodality therapy and recurrent tumor can lead to structural brain tissue damage characterized by pathologic findings in MR and PET imaging. However, little is known about the impact of different types of damage on the fiber architecture of the affected white matter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 121 pretreated patients (median age, 52 years; ECOG performance score, 0 in 48%, 1-2 in 51%) with histomolecularly characterized glioma (WHO grade IV glioblastoma, n=81; WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, n=28; WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma, n=12), who had a resection, radiotherapy, alkylating chemotherapy, or combinations thereof. After a median follow-up time of 14 months (range, 1-214 months), anatomic MR and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET images were acquired on a 3T hybrid PET/MR scanner. Post-therapeutic findings comprised resection cavities, regions with contrast enhancement or increased FET uptake and T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Local fiber density was determined from high angular-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging and advanced tractography methods. A cohort of 121 healthy subjects selected from the 1000BRAINS study matched for age, gender and education served as a control group. RESULTS: Lesion types differed in both affected tissue volumes and relative fiber densities compared to control values (resection cavities: median volume 20.9 mL, fiber density 16% of controls; contrast-enhanced lesions: 7.9 mL, 43%; FET uptake areas: 30.3 mL, 49%; T2/FLAIR hyperintensities: 53.4 mL, 57%, p<0.001). In T2/FLAIR-hyperintense lesions caused by peritumoral edema due to recurrent glioma (n=27), relative fiber density was as low as in lesions associated with radiation-induced gliosis (n=13, 48% vs. 53%, p=0.17). In regions with pathologically increased FET uptake, local fiber density was inversely related (p=0.005) to the extent of uptake. Total fiber loss associated with contrast-enhanced lesions (p=0.006) and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions (p=0.013) had a significant impact on overall ECOG score. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that apart from resection cavities, reduction in local fiber density is greatest in contrast-enhancing recurrent tumors, but total fiber loss induced by edema or gliosis has an equal detrimental effect on the patients' performance status due to the larger volume affected.

Title: The role of [(18)F]fluorodopa positron emission tomography in grading of gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Gliomas are the most commonly occurring brain tumour in adults and there remains no cure for these tumours with treatment strategies being based on tumour grade. All treatment options aim to prolong survival, maintain quality of life and slow the inevitable progression from low-grade to high-grade. Despite imaging advancements, the only reliable method to grade a glioma is to perform a biopsy, and even this is fraught with errors associated with under grading. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with amino acid tracers such as [(18)F]fluorodopa ((18)F-FDOPA), [(11)C]methionine ((11)C-MET), [(18)F]fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET), and (18)F-FDOPA are being increasingly used in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. METHODS: In this review we discuss the literature available on the ability of (18)F-FDOPA-PET to distinguish low- from high-grade in newly diagnosed gliomas. RESULTS: In 2016 the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) and European Association for Neuro-Oncology (EANO) published recommendations on the clinical use of PET imaging in gliomas. However, since these recommendations there have been a number of studies performed looking at whether (18)F-FDOPA-PET can identify areas of high-grade transformation before the typical radiological features of transformation such as contrast enhancement are visible on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CONCLUSION: Larger studies are needed to validate (18)F-FDOPA-PET as a non-invasive marker of glioma grade and prediction of tumour molecular characteristics which could guide decisions surrounding surgical resection.

Title: Differentiating high-grade glioma progression from treatment-related changes with dynamic [(18)F]FDOPA PET: a multicentric study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic accuracy of amino-acid PET for distinguishing progression from treatment-related changes (TRC) is currently based on single-center non-homogeneous glioma populations. Our study assesses the diagnostic value of static and dynamic [(18)F]FDOPA PET acquisitions to differentiate between high-grade glioma (HGG) recurrence and TRC in a large cohort sourced from two independent nuclear medicine centers. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 106 patients with suspected glioma recurrences (WHO GIII, n = 38; GIV, n = 68; IDH-mutant, n = 35, IDH-wildtype, n = 71). Patients underwent dynamic [(18)F]FDOPA PET/CT (n = 83) or PET/MRI (n = 23), and static tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs), metabolic tumor volumes and dynamic parameters (time to peak and slope) were determined. The final diagnosis was either defined by histopathology or a clinical-radiological follow-up at 6 months. Optimal [(18)F]FDOPA PET parameter cut-offs were obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Predictive factors and clinical parameters were assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses. RESULTS: Surgery or the clinical-radiological 6-month follow-up identified 71 progressions and 35 treatment-related changes. TBR(mean), with a threshold of 1.8, best-differentiated glioma recurrence/progression from post-treatment changes in the whole population (sensitivity 82%, specificity 71%, p < 0.0001) whereas curve slope was only significantly different in IDH-mutant HGGs (n = 25). In survival analyses, MTV was a clinical independent predictor of progression-free and overall survival on the multivariate analysis (p </= 0.01). A curve slope > -0.12/h was an independent predictor for longer PFS in IDH-mutant HGGs CONCLUSION: Our multicentric study confirms the high accuracy of [(18)F]FDOPA PET to differentiate recurrent malignant gliomas from TRC and emphasizes the diagnostic and prognostic value of dynamic acquisitions for IDH-mutant HGGs. KEY POINTS: * The diagnostic accuracy of dynamic amino-acid PET, for distinguishing progression from treatment-related changes, is currently based on single-center non-homogeneous glioma populations. * This multicentric study confirms the high accuracy of static [(18)F]FDOPA PET images for differentiating progression from treatment-related changes in a homogeneous population of high-grade gliomas and highlights the diagnostic and prognostic value of dynamic acquisitions for IDH-mutant high-grade gliomas. * Dynamic acquisitions should be performed in IDH-mutant glioma patients to provide valuable information for the differential diagnosis of recurrence and treatment-related changes.

Title: Multiparametric Longitudinal Profiling of RCAS-tva-Induced PDGFB-Driven Experimental Glioma.
Abstract: Glioblastomas are incurable primary brain tumors harboring a heterogeneous landscape of genetic and metabolic alterations. Longitudinal imaging by MRI and [(18)F]FET-PET measurements enable us to visualize the features of evolving tumors in a dynamic manner. Yet, close-meshed longitudinal imaging time points for characterizing temporal and spatial metabolic alterations during tumor evolution in patients is not feasible because patients usually present with already established tumors. The replication-competent avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (RCAS)/tumor virus receptor-A (tva) system is a powerful preclinical glioma model offering a high grade of spatial and temporal control of somatic gene delivery in vivo. Consequently, here, we aimed at using MRI and [(18)F]FET-PET to identify typical neuroimaging characteristics of the platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB)-driven glioma model using the RCAS-tva system. Our study showed that this preclinical glioma model displays MRI and [(18)F]FET-PET features that highly resemble the corresponding established human disease, emphasizing the high translational relevance of this experimental model. Furthermore, our investigations unravel exponential growth dynamics and a model-specific tumor microenvironment, as assessed by histology and immunochemistry. Taken together, our study provides further insights into this preclinical model and advocates for the imaging-stratified design of preclinical therapeutic interventions.

Title: TSPO PET signal using [(18)F]GE180 is associated with survival in recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Glioma patients, especially recurrent glioma, suffer from a poor prognosis. While advances to classify glioma on a molecular level improved prognostication at initial diagnosis, markers to prognosticate survival in the recurrent situation are still needed. As 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) was previously reported to be associated with aggressive histopathological glioma features, we correlated the TSPO positron emission tomography (PET) signal using [(18)F]GE180 in a large cohort of recurrent glioma patients with their clinical outcome. METHODS: In patients with [(18)F]GE180 PET at glioma recurrence, [(18)F]GE180 PET parameters (e.g., SUV(max)) as well as other imaging features (e.g., MRI volume, [(18)F]FET PET parameters when available) were evaluated together with patient characteristics (age, sex, Karnofsky-Performance score) and neuropathological features (e.g. WHO 2021 grade, IDH-mutation status). Uni- and multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival (PRS) and time to treatment failure (TTF). RESULTS: Eighty-eight consecutive patients were evaluated. TSPO tracer uptake correlated with tumor grade at recurrence (p < 0.05), with no significant differences in IDH-wild-type versus IDH-mutant tumors. Within the subgroup of IDH-mutant glioma (n = 46), patients with low SUV(max) (median split, </= 1.60) had a significantly longer PRS (median 41.6 vs. 25.3 months, p = 0.031) and TTF (32.2 vs 8.7 months, p = 0.001). Also among IDH-wild-type glioblastoma (n = 42), patients with low SUV(max) (</= 1.89) had a significantly longer PRS (median not reached vs 8.2 months, p = 0.002). SUV(max) remained an independent prognostic factor for PRS in the multivariate analysis including CNS WHO 2021 grade, IDH status, and age. Tumor volume defined by [(18)F]FET PET or contrast-enhanced MRI correlated weakly with TSPO tracer uptake. Treatment regimen did not differ among the median split subgroups. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that TSPO PET using [(18)F]GE180 can help to prognosticate recurrent glioma patients even among homogeneous molecular subgroups and may therefore serve as valuable non-invasive biomarker for individualized patient management.

Title: Primary intracranial synovial sarcoma: A case report and review of literature.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial synovial sarcomas (PrISS) are unusual dural based mesenchymal tumors seen most commonly in the supratentorial compartment. They can mimic a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or a high-grade glioma on imaging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old male presented with headache and right hemiparesis for 2 weeks. CT brain revealed a left frontal spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. PrISS revealed a heterogeneously ring enhancing solid cystic lesion with attachment to convexity dura. Intraoperatively, it mimicked a high-grade glioma. Histopathology report showed features of a synovial sarcoma, which was later confirmed with IHC. Classical SYT-SSX2 translocation was confirmed only on RTPCR after fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative for same. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET-CT) did not show any extracranial tumor. Despite radiotherapy, there were recurrence and tumor progression at 6 months and the patient succumbed 11 months later. CONCLUSION: PrISS is an unusual aggressive intracranial neoplasm that carries a worse prognosis when compared nonintracranial synovial sarcomas. Molecular cytogenetics (FISH and RTPCR) are essential for confirming the diagnosis, though FISH seems to have a lower sensitivity and can yield false negative results as was noted in this case.

Title: Noninvasive Delineation of Glioma Infiltration with Combined 7T Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Imaging and MR Spectroscopy: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study.
Abstract: For precise delineation of glioma extent, amino acid PET is superior to conventional MR imaging. Since metabolic MR sequences such as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRS) were developed, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of combined CEST and MRS to predict glioma infiltration. Eighteen glioma patients of different tumor grades were enrolled in this study; 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET)-PET, amide proton transfer CEST at 7 Tesla(T), MRS and conventional MR at 3T were conducted preoperatively. Multi modalities and their association were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis patient-wise and voxel-wise. Both CEST (R = 0.736, p < 0.001) and MRS (R = 0.495, p = 0.037) correlated with FET-PET, while the correlation between CEST and MRS was weaker. In subgroup analysis, APT values were significantly higher in high grade glioma (3.923 +/- 1.239) and IDH wildtype group (3.932 +/- 1.264) than low grade glioma (3.317 +/- 0.868, p < 0.001) or IDH mutant group (3.358 +/- 0.847, p < 0.001). Using high FET uptake as the standard, the CEST/MRS combination (AUC, 95% CI: 0.910, 0.907-0.913) predicted tumor infiltration better than CEST (0.812, 0.808-0.815) or MRS (0.888, 0.885-0.891) alone, consistent with contrast-enhancing and T2-hyperintense areas. Probability maps of tumor presence constructed from the CEST/MRS combination were preliminarily verified by multi-region biopsies. The combination of 7T CEST/MRS might serve as a promising non-radioactive alternative to delineate glioma infiltration, thus reshaping the guidance for tumor resection and irradiation.

Title: A Head-to-Head Comparison of (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and Conventional MRI as Predictors of Outcome in IDH Wild-Type High-Grade Gliomas.
Abstract: (1) Aim: To study the associations between imaging parameters derived from contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT and their performance as prognostic predictors in isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH-wt) high-grade gliomas. (2) Methods: A prospective, multicenter study (FuMeGA: Functional and Metabolic Glioma Analysis) including patients with baseline CE-MRI and 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT and IDH wild-type high-grade gliomas. Clinical variables such as performance status, extent of surgery and adjuvant treatments (Stupp protocol vs others) were obtained and used to discriminate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as end points. Multilesionality was assessed on the visual analysis of PET/CT and CE-MRI images. After tumor segmentation, standardized uptake value (SUV)-based variables for PET/CT and volume-based and geometrical variables for PET/CT and CE-MRI were calculated. The relationships among imaging techniques variables and their association with prognosis were evaluated using Pearson's chi-square test and the t-test. Receiver operator characteristic, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for the survival analysis. (3) Results: 54 patients were assessed. The median PFS and OS were 5 and 11 months, respectively. Significant strong relationships between volume-dependent variables obtained from PET/CT and CE-MRI were found (r > 0.750, p < 0.05). For OS, significant associations were found with SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean and sphericity (HR: 1.17, p = 0.035; HR: 1.24, p = 0.042; HR: 1.62, p = 0.040 and HR: 0.8, p = 0.022, respectively). Among clinical variables, only Stupp protocol and age showed significant associations with OS and PFS. No CE-MRI derived variables showed significant association with prognosis. In multivariate analysis, age (HR: 1.04, p = 0.002), Stupp protocol (HR: 2.81, p = 0.001), multilesionality (HR: 2.20, p = 0.013) and sphericity (HR: 0.79, p = 0.027) derived from PET/CT showed independent associations with OS. For PFS, only age (HR: 1.03, p = 0.021) and treatment protocol (HR: 2.20, p = 0.008) were significant predictors. (4) Conclusions: 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT metabolic and radiomic variables were robust prognostic predictors in patients with IDH-wt high-grade gliomas, outperforming CE-MRI derived variables.

Title: Multiparametric Characterization of Intracranial Gliomas Using Dynamic [18F]FET-PET and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
Abstract: Both static and dynamic O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine-(FET)-PET and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are useful tools for grading and prognostication in gliomas. However, little is known about the potential of multimodal imaging comprising both procedures. We therefore acquired NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios in multi-voxel MRS as well as FET-PET parameters in 67 glioma patients and determined multiparametric parameter combinations. Using receiver operating characteristics, differentiation between low-grade and high-grade glioma was possible by static FET-PET (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86, p = 0.001), time-to-peak (TTP; AUC 0.79, p = 0.049), and using the Cho/Cr ratio (AUC 0.72, p = 0.039), while the multimodal analysis led to improved discrimination with an AUC of 0.97 (p = 0.001). In order to distinguish glioblastoma from non-glioblastoma, MRS (NAA/Cr ratio, AUC 0.66, p = 0.031), and dynamic FET-PET (AUC 0.88, p = 0.001) were superior to static FET imaging. The multimodal analysis increased the accuracy with an AUC of 0.97 (p < 0.001). In the survival analysis, PET parameters, but not spectroscopy, were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS, static PET p = 0.014, TTP p = 0.012), still, the multiparametric analysis, including MRS, was also useful for the prediction of OS (p = 0.002). In conclusion, FET-PET and MRS provide complementary information to better characterize gliomas before therapy, which is particularly interesting with respect to the increasing use of hybrid PET/MRI for brain tumors.

Title: Prediction of response to lomustine-based chemotherapy in glioma patients at recurrence using MRI and FET PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We evaluated O-(2-[ 18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET and MRI for early response assessment in recurrent glioma patients treated with lomustine-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Thirty-six adult patients with WHO CNS grade 3 or 4 gliomas (glioblastoma, 69%) at recurrence (median number of recurrences, 1; range, 1-3) were retrospectively identified. Besides MRI, serial FET PET scans were performed at baseline and early after chemotherapy initiation (not later than two cycles). Tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR), metabolic tumor volumes (MTV), the occurrence of new distant hotspots with a mean TBR >1.6 at follow-up, and the dynamic parameter time-to-peak were derived from all FET PET scans. PET parameter thresholds were defined using ROC analyses to predict PFS of >/=6 months and OS of >/=12 months. MRI response assessment was based on RANO criteria. The predictive values of FET PET parameters and RANO criteria were subsequently evaluated using univariate and multivariate survival estimates. RESULTS: After treatment initiation, the median follow-up time was 11 months (range, 3-71 months). Relative changes of TBR, MTV, and RANO criteria predicted a significantly longer PFS (all P</=0.002) and OS (all P</=0.045). At follow-up, the occurrence of new distant hotspots (n>/=1) predicted a worse outcome, with significantly shorter PFS (P=0.005) and OS (P<0.001). Time-to-peak changes did not predict a significantly longer survival. Multivariate survival analyses revealed that new distant hotspots at follow-up FET PET were most potent in predicting non-response (P<0.001; HR, 8.578). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that FET PET provides complementary information to RANO criteria for response evaluation of lomustine-based chemotherapy early after treatment initiation.

Title: The impact of tumor metabolic activity assessed by (18)F-FET amino acid PET imaging in particle radiotherapy of high-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Selective uptake of (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) is used in high-grade glioma (HGG) to assess tumor metabolic activity via positron emission tomography (PET). We aim to investigate its value for target volume definition, as a prognosticator, and associations with whole-blood transcriptome liquid biopsy (WBT lbx) for which we recently reported feasibility to mirror tumor characteristics and response to particle irradiation in recurrent HGG (rHGG). METHODS: (18)F-FET-PET data from n = 43 patients with primary glioblastoma (pGBM) and n = 33 patients with rHGG were assessed. pGBM patients were irradiated with photons and sequential proton/carbon boost, and rHGG patients were treated with carbon re-irradiation (CIR). WBT (Illumina HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChips) lbx was available for n = 9 patients from the rHGG cohort. PET isocontours (40%-70% SUVmax, 10% steps) and MRI-based treatment volumes (MRIvol) were compared using the conformity index (CI) (pGBM, n = 16; rHGG, n = 27). Associations with WBT lbx data were tested on gene expression level and inferred pathways activity scores (PROGENy) and from transcriptome estimated cell fractions (CIBERSORT, xCell). RESULTS: In pGBM, median SUVmax was higher in PET acquired pre-radiotherapy (4.1, range (R) 1.5-7.8; n = 20) vs. during radiotherapy (3.3, R 1.5-5.7, n = 23; p = 0.03) and in non-resected (4.7, R 2.9-7.9; n = 11) vs. resected tumors (3.3, R 1.5-7.8, n = 32; p = 0.01). In rHGG, a trend toward higher SUVmax values in grade IV tumors was observed (p = 0.13). Median MRIvol was 32.34 (R 8.75-108.77) cm(3) in pGBM (n = 16) and 20.77 (R 0.63-128.44) cm(3) in rHGG patients (n = 27). The highest median CI was observed for 40% (pGBM, 0.31) and 50% (rHGG, 0.43, all tumors) isodose, with 70% (40%) isodose in grade III (IV) rHGG tumors (median CI, 0.38 and 0.49). High SUVmax was linked to shorter survival in pGBM (>3.3, p = 0.001, OR 6.0 [2.1-17.4]) and rHGG (>2.8, p = 0.02, OR 4.1 [1.2-13.9]). SUVmax showed associations with inferred monocyte fractions, hypoxia, and TGFbeta pathway activity and links to immune checkpoint gene expression from WBT lbx. CONCLUSION: The benefits of (18)F-FET-PET imaging on gross tumor volume (GTV) definition for particle radiotherapy warrant further evaluation. SUVmax might assist in prognostic stratification of HGG patients for particle radiotherapy, highlights heterogeneity in rHGG, and is positively associated with unfavorable signatures in peripheral whole-blood transcriptomes.

Title: Case of Glioblastoma Multiforme in the Left Temporoparietal Region of the Brain.
Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most frequent and malignant primary brain or spinal cord cancers. We present the case of a 48-year-old man diagnosed with a grade IV histology tumor, which is the most fatal according to WHO classification. Mutations in the p53, retinoblastoma protein (RB), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), rat sarcoma (RAS), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling genes are frequently seen in glioblastoma. Radiation therapy, alkylating chemotherapy, and surgery are often used as glioblastoma treatments. O6-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation predicts the effectiveness of alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide, which directs the selection of first-line therapy in elderly patients. Glioblastoma goes unnoticed because of age-related factors, yet it is recognized that older people are more prone to getting it. The patient also had nausea, vomiting, and headaches. The disease's course was slowed while the patient's signs and symptoms were lessened by the treatment. The doctor checks reflexes, eyesight, hearing, coordination, and more. MRI is the most reliable tool for locating glial tumours. It is also possible to do additional diagnostic procedures like CT or positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A biopsy may also be carried out, depending on the circumstances and the location of the tumor. A biopsy's objective is to identify the cell's kind and the amount of its dissemination; specialized tests carried out by medical professionals and technicians reveal the prognosis and better treatment alternatives. The only treatments accessible now are surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, tumor treating fields therapy, targeted medication therapy, and palliative care. It is anticipated that there will be fewer fatalities in the future.

Title: [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI, histological PSMA expression and preliminary experience with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy in relapsing high-grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: High-grade gliomas (HGG) are still associated with a dismal prognosis. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is discussed as a theranostic target for PSMA-directed radioligand therapy ([(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT). Here, we report on the correlation of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA uptake with histological PSMA expression and on our preliminary experience with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT in relapsing HGG. METHODS: Patients with relapsing HGG underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI to evaluate eligibility for an individualized treatment approach with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA. Standard uptake values (SUV) for tumor and liver and respective tumor-to-background ratios (compared to the liver) (TBR) on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI were assessed. Eligibility criteria for [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy were exhaustion of all standard treatment options available and TBR(max)>1.0. In 11 samples, immunohistochemical PSMA expression was determined, quantified using the H-score and correlated with uptake on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI. RESULTS: We included 20 patients with a median age of 53 years (IQR 42-57). The median SUV on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI was 4.5 (3.7-6.2) for SUV(max) and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) for SUV(mean). The respective TBR was maximum 0.6 (0.4-0.8) and mean 0.3 (0.2-0.4). High TBR(max) correlated with increased endothelial PSMA expression [H-score of 65 (62.5-77.5)]. Three patients (15%) presented a TBR(max)>1.0 and qualified for [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT. No treatment related toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Only a minority of patients with relapsing HGG qualified for [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT. Our data demonstrates that PSMA expression in the neo-vasculature corresponds to PSMA uptake on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/MRI and might be used as a screening tool for patient selection. Future prospective studies need to focus the debate on TBR(max) thresholds as inclusion criteria for PSMA RLT.

Title: Potential (18)F-RGD PET/CT and DCE-MRI Imaging-Based Biomarkers for Postoperative Survival Prediction Among Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Treated With Bevacizumab and Chemoradiotherapy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of potential imaging biomarkers based on (18)F-AlF-NOTA-PRGD2 positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-RGD PET/CT) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) imaging to predict the response to bevacizumab combined with conventional therapy in postoperative newly diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS: Twenty patients with newly diagnosed with glioblastoma after surgery were prospectively enrolled to receive bevacizumab plus conventional concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide (CCRT). (18)F-RGD PET/CT and DCE-MRI were performed at baseline, week 3, and week 10 for each patient. Statistical methods included the analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: All patients completed CCRT plus bevacizumab therapy without interruption. The median follow-up time was 33.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.3-39.5 months). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 9.66 months (95% CI, 6.20-13.12 months) and 15.89 months (95% CI, 13.89-17.78), respectively. Treatment was generally well tolerated, and there were no Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with a toxicity grade equal to or exceeding 3 or that led to termination of treatment or patient death.Over the treatment interval of bevacizumab therapy from week 3 to week 10, patients with a large decrease of SUVmean was associated with a better PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.562, 95% CI (1.318-32.667), p=0.022. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with a decrease in the SUVmean of more than 0.115 on (18)F-RGD PET/CT had a longer PFS than those with a decrease in the SUVmean of 0.115 or less (12.25 months vs.7.46 months, p=0.009). For OS, only a small decrease of Ktrans was also found to have certain prognostic value (HR=0.986, 95% CI (0.975-0.998), p=0.023). Patients with a decrease in Ktrans larger than 37.03 (min-1) on DCE-MRI had worse OS than those with a decrease in Ktrans of 37.03 (min-1) or less (15.93 months vs. 26.42 months, p=0.044). CONCLUSION: (18)F-RGD PET/CT and DCE-MRI may be valuable in evaluating the response of glioblastoma to treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and CCRT, with a greater decrease in SUV(mean) predicting better PFS as well as a small decrease in K(trans) predicting improved OS.

Title: Use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in differential diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma and high-grade gliomas: A meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and high-grade glioma (HGG) appear similar under imaging. However, since the two tumors vary in their treatment methods, their differential diagnosis is crucial. The use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) imaging to effectively distinguish between the two tumors is not clear; therefore, a meta-analysis was carried out to determine its effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Science, and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP) were exhaustively searched using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to select high-quality literature. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used for the qualitative assessment of the included literature. The bivariate effect model was used to combine statistics such as sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)], plot summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) value. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the stability of the results, and Deek's test was used to assess publication bias. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis was used to determine the sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of nine studies were included in this study. For differential diagnosis of PCNSL and HGG, the combined SEN was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.80-0.96; I(2) = 46.73%), combined SPE was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93; I(2) = 56.30%), the combined PLR was 7.83 (95% CI: 4.96-12.37; I(2) = 15.57%), combined NLR was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.23; I(2) = 31.99%), combined DOR was 77.36 (95% CI: 32.74-182.77; I(2) = 70.70%). The AUC of SROC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97). No publication bias was found and the sample size and different parameters were the primary reason for heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging technique has a high diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of PNCSL and HGG. Patients suspected to have the above two tumors are suggested to be examined by 18F-FDG-PET / CT to help in the clinical distinction and further treatment modalities.

Title: Radiotherapy Target Volume Definition in Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Using 18F-FET PET Imaging and Multiparametric MRI: An Inter Observer Agreement Study.
Abstract: Background: The aim of this prospective monocentric study was to assess the inter-observer agreement for tumor volume delineations by multiparametric MRI and 18-F-FET-PET/CT in newly diagnosed, untreated high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. Methods: Thirty patients HGG underwent O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine(18F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET), and multiparametric MRI with computation of rCBV map and K2 map. Three nuclear physicians and three radiologists with different levels of experience delineated the 18-F-FET-PET/CT and 6 MRI sequences, respectively. Spatial similarity (Dice and Jaccard: DSC and JSC) and overlap (Overlap: OV) coefficients were calculated between the readers for each sequence. Results: DSC, JSC, and OV were high for 18F-FET PET/CT, T1-GD, and T2-FLAIR (>0.67). The Spearman correlation coefficient between readers was >/=0.6 for these sequences. Cross-comparison of similarity and overlap parameters showed significant differences for DSC and JSC between 18F-FET PET/CT and T2-FLAIR and for JSC between 18F-FET PET/CT and T1-GD with higher values for 18F-FET PET/CT. No significant difference was found between T1-GD and T2-FLAIR. rCBV, K2, b1000, and ADC showed correlation coefficients between readers <0.6. Conclusion: The interobserver agreements for tumor volume delineations were high for 18-F-FET-PET/CT, T1-GD, and T2-FLAIR. The DWI (b1000, ADC), rCBV, and K2-based sequences, as performed, did not seem sufficiently reproducible to be used in daily practice.

Title: Multicenter clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI predict ATRX mutation status in IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To develop a clinical radiomics-integrated model based on (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) and multi-modal MRI for predicting alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) mutation status of IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). METHODS: One hundred and two patients (47 ATRX mutant-type, 55 ATRX wild-type) diagnosed with IDH-mutant LGGs (CNS WHO grades 1 and 2) were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 5540 radiomics features were extracted from structural MR (sMR) images (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, CE-T1WI; T2-weighted imaging, and T2WI), functional MR (fMR) images (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC; cerebral blood volume, CBV), and metabolic PET images ([(18)F]FDG PET). The random forest algorithm was used to establish a clinical radiomics-integrated model, integrating the optimal multi-modal radiomics model with three clinical parameters. The predictive effectiveness of the models was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The optimal multi-modal model incorporated sMR (CE-T1WI), fMR (ADC), and metabolic ([(18)F]FDG) images ([(18)F]FDG PET+ADC+ CE-T1WI) with the area under curves (AUCs) in the training and test groups of 0.971 and 0.962, respectively. The clinical radiomics-integrated model, incorporating [(18)F]FDG PET+ADC+CE-T1WI, three clinical parameters (KPS, SFSD, and ATGR), showed the best predictive effectiveness in the training and test groups (0.987 and 0.975, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical radiomics-integrated model with metabolic, structural, and functional information based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI achieved promising performance for predicting the ATRX mutation status of IDH-mutant LGGs. KEY POINTS: * The clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI achieved promising performance for predicting ATRX mutation status in LGGs. * The study investigated the value of multicenter clinical radiomics-integrated model based on [(18)F]FDG PET and multi-modal MRI in LGGs regarding ATRX mutation status prediction. * The integrated model provided structural, functional, and metabolic information simultaneously and demonstrated with satisfactory calibration and discrimination in the training and test groups (0.987 and 0.975, respectively).

Title: Decoding the Heterogeneity of Malignant Gliomas by PET and MRI for Spatial Habitat Analysis of Hypoxia, Perfusion, and Diffusion Imaging: A Preliminary Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumor heterogeneity poses major clinical challenges in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Quantitative radiomic analysis with spatial tumor habitat clustering represents an innovative, non-invasive approach to represent and quantify tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. To date, habitat imaging has been applied mainly on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although virtually extendible to any imaging modality, including advanced MRI techniques such as perfusion and diffusion MRI as well as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate an innovative PET and MRI approach for assessing hypoxia, perfusion, and tissue diffusion in HGGs and derive a combined map for clustering of intra-tumor heterogeneity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients harboring HGGs underwent a pre-operative acquisition of MR perfusion (PWI), Diffusion (dMRI) and (18)F-labeled fluoroazomycinarabinoside ((18)F-FAZA) PET imaging to evaluate tumor vascularization, cellularity, and hypoxia, respectively. Tumor volumes were segmented on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 post-contrast images, and voxel-wise clustering of each quantitative imaging map identified eight combined PET and physiologic MRI habitats. Habitats' spatial distribution, quantitative features and histopathological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: A highly reproducible distribution pattern of the clusters was observed among different cases, particularly with respect to morphological landmarks as the necrotic core, contrast-enhancing vital tumor, and peritumoral infiltration and edema, providing valuable supplementary information to conventional imaging. A preliminary analysis, performed on stereotactic bioptic samples where exact intracranial coordinates were available, identified a reliable correlation between the expected microenvironment of the different spatial habitats and the actual histopathological features. A trend toward a higher representation of the most aggressive clusters in WHO (World Health Organization) grade IV compared to WHO III was observed. CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings demonstrated high reproducibility of the PET and MRI hypoxia, perfusion, and tissue diffusion spatial habitat maps and correlation with disease-specific histopathological features.

Title: Diagnostic yield of simultaneous dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion measurements and [(18)F]FET PET in patients with suspected recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Both amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blood volume (BV) measurements are used in suspected recurrent high-grade gliomas. We compared the separate and combined diagnostic yield of simultaneously acquired dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MRI and O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) PET in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma following standard therapy. METHODS: A total of 76 lesions in 60 hybrid [(18)F]FET PET/MRI scans with DCE MRI from patients with suspected recurrence of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma were included retrospectively. BV was measured from DCE MRI employing a 2-compartment exchange model (2CXM). Diagnostic performances of maximal tumour-to-background [(18)F]FET uptake (TBR(max)), maximal BV (BV(max)) and normalised BV(max) (nBV(max)) were determined by ROC analysis using 6-month histopathological (n = 28) or clinical/radiographical follow-up (n = 48) as reference. Sensitivity and specificity at optimal cut-offs were determined separately for enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. RESULTS: In progressive lesions, all BV and [(18)F]FET metrics were higher than in non-progressive lesions. ROC analyses showed higher overall ROC AUCs for TBR(max) than both BV(max) and nBV(max) in both lesion-wise (all lesions, p = 0.04) and in patient-wise analysis (p < 0.01). Combining TBR(max) with BV metrics did not increase ROC AUC. Lesion-wise positive fraction/sensitivity/specificity at optimal cut-offs were 55%/91%/84% for TBR(max), 45%/77%/84% for BV(max) and 59%/84%/72% for nBV(max). Combining TBR(max) and best-performing BV cut-offs yielded lesion-wise sensitivity/specificity of 75/97%. The fraction of progressive lesions was 11% in concordant negative lesions, 33% in lesions only BV positive, 64% in lesions only [(18)F]FET positive and 97% in concordant positive lesions. CONCLUSION: The overall diagnostic accuracy of DCE BV imaging is good, but lower than that of [(18)F]FET PET. Adding DCE BV imaging did not improve the overall diagnostic accuracy of [(18)F]FET PET, but may improve specificity and allow better lesion-wise risk stratification than [(18)F]FET PET alone.

Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of PET/CT or PET/MRI Using PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals in High-Grade Gliomas: A Systematic Review and a Bivariate Meta-Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several studies proposed the use of positron emission tomography (PET) with Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in brain tumors. Our aim is to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of these methods in high-grade gliomas (HGG) with a bivariate meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of studies on the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT or PET/MRI with PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in HGG was performed. Original articles evaluating these imaging methods both in the differential diagnosis between HGG and low-grade gliomas (LGG) and in the assessment of suspicious HGG recurrence were included. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Statistical heterogeneity was also assessed using the I(2) test. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of six selected studies (157 patients) provided the following results about PET/CT or PET/MRI with PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in the diagnosis of HGG: sensitivity 98.2% (95% CI: 75.3-99.9%), specificity 91.2% (95% CI: 68.4-98.1%), LR+ 4.5 (95% CI: 2.2-9.3), LR- 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04-0.15), and DOR 70.1 (95% CI: 19.6-250.9). No significant statistical heterogeneity among the included studies was found (I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: the quantitative data provided demonstrate the high diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT or PET/MRI with PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals for HGG detection. However, more studies are needed to confirm the promising role of PSMA-targeted PET in this clinical setting.

Title: 11 C-Acetate PET/CT Detects Reactive Astrogliosis Helping Glioma Classification.
Abstract: PURPOSE: 11 C-acetate ( 11 C-ACE) uptake on PET/CT was recently discovered to represent reactive astrocytes in the tumor microenvironment. This study aimed at evaluating the role of 11 C-ACE PET/CT as an imaging biomarker of reactive astrogliosis in characterizing different types of gliomas. METHODS: In this prospective study, a total of 182 patients underwent 11 C-ACE PET/CT before surgery. The ratio of SUV max of a glioma to the SUV mean of the contralateral choroid plexus ( 11 C-ACE TCR) on PET/CT was calculated. 11 C-ACE TCRs were compared with the World Health Organization grades and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) mutation status. Grade 2 was considered low-grade tumor, and grades 3 and 4 were considered high-grade tumors. RESULTS: The median 11 C-ACE TCR was significantly higher in IDH1 wild-type (wt) tumors (n = 91) than in IDH1 -mutant (mt) tumors (n = 91) (2.38 vs 1.30, P < 0.001). Of the 91 IDH1 -mt tumors, there were no differences in the median 11 C-ACE TCRs between oligodendrogliomas (ODs) and astrocytic tumors (1.40 vs 1.20, P > 0.05). In grading low- versus high-grade gliomas, the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed a higher area under the curve (0.951) in IDH1 -wt tumors than in IDH1 -mt tumors (0.783, P = 0.002). Grade 2 ODs were well differentiated from high-grade gliomas. The 11 C-ACE TCR of grade 3 ODs was significantly lower than that of IDH1 -wt glioblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: High 11 C-ACE uptake is associated with high-grade IDH1 -wt tumors, thus facilitating differentiation from high-grade IDH1-mt and low-grade gliomas. In particular, low 11 C-ACE uptake in ODs is advantageous in overcoming the limitation of radiolabeled amino acid tracers.

Title: 18 F-FDOPA and MRI Findings in a Case of Multiple Sclerosis.
Abstract: A 39-year-old woman with no significant medical history underwent a brain MRI because of headaches and dysarthria having lasted 3 weeks. A tumor lesion was suspected. PET imaging was decided. She underwent FDG and FDOPA PET, leading to the diagnosis of low-grade glioma. Three months later, a new imaging assessment was organized. It showed a decrease in the hypermetabolism of the lesion and the appearance of a second lesion questioning the diagnosis. Further assessment led to the conclusion of a multiple sclerosis. This case illustrates that FDOPA PET uptake should be interpreted with caution in patients with suspected primary brain tumors.

Title: Pseudo-insular glioma syndrome: illustrative cases.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lower-grade insular gliomas often appear as expansile and infiltrative masses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are nonneoplastic lesions of the insula, such as demyelinating disease and vasculopathies, that can mimic insular gliomas. OBSERVATIONS: The authors report two patients who presented with headaches and were found to have mass lesions concerning for lower-grade insular glioma based on MRI obtained at initial presentation. However, on the immediate preoperative MRI obtained a few weeks later, both patients had spontaneous and complete resolution of the insular lesions. LESSONS: Tumor mimics should always be in the differential diagnosis of brain masses, including those involving the insula. The immediate preoperative MRI (within 24-48 hours of surgery) must be compared carefully with the initial presentation MRI to assess interval change that suggests tumor mimics to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.

Abstract: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of the tumor stroma. Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel (99m)Tc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 +/- 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (n = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1); and breast (n = 21), lung (n = 2), colorectal (n = 1) and cervical (n = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [(18)F]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 +/- 63 MBq). The total lesions (n = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III-IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP and [(18)F]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [(18)F]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP. In patients with breast cancer, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated among [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP uptake values (Bq/cm(3)) of PT and the molecular subtype, being higher for subtypes HER2+ and Luminal B HER2-enriched. Four different CAF subpopulations have previously been described for LNm of breast cancer (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1, which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2 and triple-negative), confirming that FAP+ is a marker for poor disease prognosis. The results of this pilot clinical research show that [(99m)Tc]Tc-iFAP SPECT imaging is a promising tool in the prognostic assessment of some solid tumors, particularly breast cancer.

Title: The Use of (18)F-FET-PET-MRI in Neuro-Oncology: The Best of Both Worlds-A Narrative Review.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most frequent primary tumors of the brain. They can be divided into grade II-IV astrocytomas and grade II-III oligodendrogliomas, based on their histomolecular profile. The prognosis and treatment is highly dependent on grade and well-identified prognostic and/or predictive molecular markers. Multi-parametric MRI, including diffusion weighted imaging, perfusion, and MR spectroscopy, showed increasing value in the non-invasive characterization of specific molecular subsets of gliomas. Radiolabeled amino-acid analogues, such as 18F-FET, have also been proven valuable in glioma imaging. These tracers not only contribute in the diagnostic process by detecting areas of dedifferentiation in diffuse gliomas, but this technique is also valuable in the follow-up of gliomas, as it can differentiate pseudo-progression from real tumor progression. Since multi-parametric MRI and 18F-FET PET are complementary imaging techniques, there may be a synergistic role for PET-MRI imaging in the neuro-oncological imaging of primary brain tumors. This could be of value for both primary staging, as well as during treatment and follow-up.

Title: Target receptor identification and subsequent treatment of resected brain tumors with encapsulated and engineered allogeneic stem cells.
Abstract: Cellular therapies offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the highly malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). However, their clinical translation is limited by the lack of effective target identification and stringent testing in pre-clinical models that replicate standard treatment in GBM patients. In this study, we show the detection of cell surface death receptor (DR) target on CD146-enriched circulating tumor cells (CTC) captured from the blood of mice bearing GBM and patients diagnosed with GBM. Next, we developed allogeneic "off-the-shelf" clinical-grade bifunctional mesenchymal stem cells (MSC(Bif)) expressing DR-targeted ligand and a safety kill switch. We show that biodegradable hydrogel encapsulated MSC(Bif) (EnMSC(Bif)) has a profound therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing patient-derived invasive, primary and recurrent GBM tumors following surgical resection. Activation of the kill switch enhances the efficacy of MSC(Bif) and results in their elimination post-tumor treatment which can be tracked by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This study establishes a foundation towards a clinical trial of EnMSC(Bif) in primary and recurrent GBM patients.

Title: Initial results of a phase II trial of (18)F-DOPA PET-guided re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: In-field high-grade glioma (HGG) recurrence is a common challenge with limited treatment options, including re-irradiation. The radiotracer 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) crosses the blood brain barrier and demonstrates high uptake in tumor, but low uptake in normal tissue. This study investigated whether (18)F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI guided re-irradiation for recurrent HGG may improve progression free survival (PFS). METHODS: Adults with recurrent or progressive HGG previously treated with radiation were eligible. The primary endpoint was a 20% improvement from the historical control PFS at 3 months (PFS3) of 20% with systemic therapy alone. Re-RT dose was 35 Gy in 10 fractions. The target volume was MRI T1 contrast-enhancement defined tumor plus (18)F-DOPA PET defined tumor. RESULTS: Twenty patients completed treatment per protocol. Diagnosis was most commonly glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (60%). MRI-defined volumes were expanded by a median 43% (0-436%) by utilizing (18)F-DOPA PET. PFS3 was 85% (95% CI 63.2-95.8%), meeting the primary endpoint of PFS3 >/= 40%. With 9.7 months median follow-up, 17 (85%) had progressed and 15 (75%) had died. Median OS from re-RT was 8.8 months. Failure following re-RT was within both the MRI and PET tumor volumes in 75%, MRI only in 13%, PET only in 0%, and neither in 13%. Four (20%) patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, including CNS necrosis (n = 2, both asymptomatic with bevacizumab initiation for radiographic findings), seizures (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and nausea (n = 1). No grade 4-5 toxicities were observed. CONCLUSION: (18)F-DOPA PET-guided re-irradiation for progressive high-grade glioma appears safe and promising for further investigation.

Title: The Utility of Conventional Amino Acid PET Radiotracers in the Evaluation of Glioma Recurrence also in Comparison with MRI.
Abstract: AIM: In this comprehensive review we present an update on the most relevant studies evaluating the utility of amino acid PET radiotracers for the evaluation of glioma recurrence as compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A literature search extended until June 2020 on the PubMed/MEDLINE literature database was conducted using the terms "high-grade glioma", "glioblastoma", "brain tumors", "positron emission tomography", "PET", "amino acid PET", "[(11)C]methyl-l-methionine", "[(18)F]fluoroethyl-tyrosine", "[(18)F]fluoro-l-dihydroxy-phenylalanine", "MET", "FET", "DOPA", "magnetic resonance imaging", "MRI", "advanced MRI", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "perfusion-weighted imaging", "diffusion-weighted imaging", "MRS", "PWI", "DWI", "hybrid PET/MR", "glioma recurrence", "pseudoprogression", "PSP", "treatment-related change", and "radiation necrosis" alone and in combination. Only original articles edited in English and about humans with at least 10 patients were included. RESULTS: Forty-four articles were finally selected. Conventional amino acid PET tracers were demonstrated to be reliable diagnostic techniques in differentiating tumor recurrence thanks to their high uptake from tumor tissue and low background in normal grey matter, giving additional and early information to standard modalities. Among them, MET-PET seems to present the highest diagnostic value but its use is limited to on-site cyclotron facilities. [(18)F]labelled amino acids, such as FDOPA and FET, were developed to provide a more suitable PET tracer for routine clinical applications, and demonstrated similar diagnostic performance. When compared to the gold standard MRI, amino acid PET provides complementary and comparable information to standard modalities and seems to represent an essential tool in the differentiation between tumor recurrence and other entities such as pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, and pseudoresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the introduction of new advanced imaging techniques, the diagnosis of glioma recurrence remains challenging. In this scenario, the growing knowledge about imaging techniques and analysis, such as the combined PET/MRI and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), could represent promising tools to face this difficult and debated clinical issue.

Title: PET With 11C-Methyl-l-Methionine as a Predictor of Consequential Outcomes at the Time of Discontinuing Temozolomide-Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Residual IDH-Mutant Lower-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether PET with 11C-methyl-l-methionine (11C-met PET) can predict consequential outcomes at the time of discontinuing temozolomide (TMZ)-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with residual isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH)-mutant lower-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 30 patients showing residual lesions of IDH-mutant lower-grade glioma, we compared the tumor-to-normal brain tissue ratio of standardized uptake values (SUVT/N) from 11C-met PET at the time of discontinuing TMZ-adjuvant chemotherapy with putative predictive factors including age, Karnofsky Performance Scale, number of courses of adjuvant therapy, residual tumor size, and promotor methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase gene (MGMT). For each factor, progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between groups divided by cutoff values, determined to predict tumor relapse using receiver operating characteristic curves for each factor. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using log-rank testing and Cox regression analysis, respectively. In addition, PFS was compared between patients grouped by combined findings from multiple predictors identified from univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses identified SUVT/N from 11C-met PET and MGMT methylation status as independent predictors of outcomes after TMZ discontinuation. When comparing 3 groups assigned by the combination of MGMT and SUVT/N findings, PFS differed significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that 11C-met PET at the time of discontinuing TMZ-adjuvant chemotherapy allows prediction of outcomes at least comparable to MGMT methylation status in patients with residual IDH-mutant lower-grade glioma. Further, 11C-met PET allows more precise prediction of outcomes by assessment in combination with MGMT findings.

Title: Relapsing High-Grade Glioma from Peritumoral Zone: Critical Review of Radiotherapy Treatment Options.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of about 15 months. After the prior treatment, GBM tends to relapse within the high dose radiation field, defined as the peritumoral brain zone (PTZ), needing a second treatment. In the present review, the primary role of ionizing radiation in recurrent GBM is discussed, and the current literature knowledge about the different radiation modalities, doses and fractionation options at our disposal is summarized. Therefore, the focus is on the necessity of tailoring the treatment approach to every single patient and using radiomics and PET/MRI imaging to have a relatively good outcome and avoid severe toxicity. The use of charged particle therapy and radiosensitizers to overcome GBM radioresistance is considered, even if further studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness in the setting of reirradiation.

Title: Incidental prostate-specific membrane antigen-avid glioblastoma detected on (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT.
Abstract: A 74-year-old man was referred for a (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT scan for newly diagnosed prostate cancer which confirmed the presence of PSMA avid cancer in the right gland with no evidence of PSMA metastasis. Incidentally, there was a markedly PSMA avid (SUVmax 7.0) lobulated periventricular mass in the region of the left basal ganglia which was T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense with perilesional oedema and vivid Gadolinium enhancement on MRI. The patient underwent stereotactic guided biopsy which confirmed LHD wild-type glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).

Title: Diagnostic Yield and Complication Rate of Stereotactic Biopsies in Precision Medicine of Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: An integrated diagnosis consisting of histology and molecular markers is the basis of the current WHO classification system of gliomas. In patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma, stereotactic biopsy is an alternative in cases in which microsurgical resection is deemed to not be safely feasible or indicated. In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze both the diagnostic yield and the safety of a standardized biopsy technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The institutional database was screened for frame-based biopsy procedures (January 2016 until March 2021). Only patients with a suspected diagnosis of glioma based on imaging were included. All tumors were classified according to the current WHO grading system. The clinical parameters, procedural complications, histology, and molecular signature of the tissues obtained were assessed. RESULTS: Between January 2016 and March 2021, 1,214 patients underwent a stereotactic biopsy: 617 (50.8%) for a newly diagnosed lesion and 597 (49.2%) for a suspected recurrence. The median age was 56.9 years (range 5 months-94.4 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guidance was used in 99.3% of cases and additional positron emission tomography (PET)-guidance in 34.3% of cases. In total, stereotactic serial biopsy provided an integrated diagnosis in 96.3% of all procedures. The most frequent diagnoses were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype glioblastoma (n = 596; 49.2%), oligodendroglioma grade 2 (n = 109; 9%), astrocytoma grade 3 (n = 108; 8.9%), oligodendroglioma grade 3 (n = 76; 6.3%), and astrocytoma grade 2 (n = 66; 5.4%). A detailed determination was successful for IDH 1/2 mutation in 99.4% of cases, for 1p/19q codeletion in 97.4% of cases, for TERT mutation in 98.9% of cases, and for MGMT promoter methylation in 99.1% of cases. Next-generation sequencing was evaluable in 64/67 (95.5%) of cases and DNA methylome analysis in 41/44 (93.2%) of cases. Thirteen (1.1%) cases showed glial tumors that could not be further specified. Seventy-three tumors were different non-glioma entities, e.g., of infectious or inflammatory nature. Seventy-five out of 597 suspected recurrences turned out to be post-therapeutic changes only. The rate of post-procedural complications with clinical symptoms of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher was 1.2% in overall patients and 2.6% in the subgroup of brainstem biopsies. There was no fatal outcome in the entire series. CONCLUSION: Image-guided stereotactic serial biopsy enables obtaining reliable histopathological and molecular diagnoses with a very low complication rate even in tumors with critical localization. Thus, in patients not undergoing microsurgical resection, this is a valuable tool for precision medicine of patients with glioma.

Title: Prognostic Potential of Postoperative 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in Patients With High-Grade Glioma. Clinical Validation of FuMeGA Postoperative PET Criteria.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic performance of postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG). METHODS: Patients with HGG who underwent preoperative and postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT were prospectively enrolled in the study. Postoperative MRI was classified as complete versus incomplete resection. Postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT was classified as negative (complete) or positive for metabolic residual tumor (incomplete resection) using a 5-point score system. The correlation of positive locations on PET/CT with the sites of subsequent tumor recurrence was evaluated. The concordance of postoperative imaging techniques (Cohen kappa) and their relation with progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies, belonging to 47 patients, were assessed. Four patients underwent 2 postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT scans as they needed a second tumor resection for recurrence. In the follow-up, 42 patients progressed, and 37 died. Concordance between postoperative PET/CT and MRI assessment was poor. Resection grade on MRI did not show any significant association with prognosis. In multivariate analysis, only age and postoperative PET/CT showed significant association with progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 [1.01-1.06, P = 0.006] and 1.88 [0.96-3.71, P = 0.067], respectively) and overall survival (HR, 1.04 [1.01-1.07, P = 0.004] and 2.63 [1.22-5.68, P = 0.014], respectively). Postoperative positive 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT locations correlated with the sites of subsequent tumor recurrence in 81.82% of cases. CONCLUSION: Postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT seems superior to postoperative MRI in the outcome prediction of patients with HGG, outperforming it in the identification of the most probable location of tumor recurrence.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Algorithm-Based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the Treatment of Glioma Biopsy.
Abstract: This study was aimed at exploring the application value of positron emission tomography (PET) + magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) in the biopsy and treatment of intracranial glioma. 35 patients with preoperatively suspicious gliomas were selected as the research objects. Their imaging images were processed using CNN. They were performed with the preoperative head MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and ethylcholine (FECH) PET scans to construct the cancer tissue contours. In addition, the performance of CNN was evaluated, and the postoperative pathology of patients was analyzed. The results suggested that the CNN-based PET + MRI technology showed a recognition accuracy of 97% for images. Semiquantitative analysis was adopted to analyze the standard uptake value (SUV). It was found that the SUV(FDG) and SUV(FECH) of grade II/III glioma were 9.77 +/- 4.87 and 1.82 +/- 0.50, respectively, and the SUV(FDG) and SUV(FECH) of grade IV glioma were 13.91 +/- 1.83 and 3.65 +/- 0.34, respectively. According to FDG PET, the mean value of SUV on the lesion side of grade IV glioma was greater than that of grade II-III glioma, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05), and similar results were obtained on FECH PET. It showed that CNN-based PET + MRI fusion technology can effectively improve the recognition effect of glioma, can more accurately determine the scope of glioma lesions, and can predict the degree of malignant glioma to a certain extent.

Title: Multi-tracer and multiparametric PET imaging to detect the IDH mutation in glioma: a preclinical translational in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This translational study explores multi-tracer PET imaging for the non-invasive detection of the IDH1 mutation which is a positive prognostic factor in glioma. METHODS: U87 human high-grade glioma (HGG) isogenic cell lines with or without the IDH1 mutation (CRISP/Cas9 method) were stereotactically grafted into rat brains, and examined, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. PET imaging sessions, with radiotracers specific for glycolytic metabolism ([(18)F]FDG), amino acid metabolism ([(18)F]FDopa), and inflammation ([(18)F]DPA-714), were performed sequentially during 3-4 days. The in vitro radiotracer uptake was expressed as percent per million cells. For each radiotracer examined in vivo, static analyses included the maximal and mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR(max) and TBR(mean)) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Dynamic analyses included the distribution volume ratio (DVR) and the relative residence time (RRT) extracted from a reference Logan model. Ex vivo analyses consisted of immunological analyses. RESULTS: In vitro, IDH1+ cells (i.e. cells expressing the IDH1 mutation) showed lower levels of [(18)F]DPA-714 uptake compared to IDH1- cells (p < 0.01). These results were confirmed in vivo with lower [(18)F]DPA-714 uptake in IDH+ tumors (3.90 versus 5.52 for TBR(max), p = 0.03). Different values of [(18)F]DPA-714 and [(18)F] FDopa RRT (respectively 11.07 versus 22.33 and 2.69 versus - 1.81 for IDH+ and IDH- tumors, p < 0.02) were also observed between the two types of tumors. RRT [(18)F]DPA-714 provided the best diagnostic performance to discriminate between the two cell lines (AUC of 100%, p < 0.01). Immuno-histological analyses revealed lower expression of Iba-1 and TSPO antibodies in IDH1+ tumors. CONCLUSIONS: [18F]DPA-714 and [18F] FDopa both correlate with the presence of the IDH1 mutation in HGG. These radiotracers are therefore good candidates for translational studies investigating their clinical applications in patients.

Title: Differentiation of high-grade glioma and primary central nervous system lymphoma: Multiparametric imaging of the enhancing tumor and peritumoral regions based on hybrid (18)F-FDG PET/MRI.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of the (18)F-FDG PET/MRI multiparametric model in the differentiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), with emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the enhancing tumor (ET) and non-enhancing peritumoral region (PTR). METHODS: Forty-five patients with HGG and 20 patients with PCNSL who underwent simultaneous (18)F-FDG PET, arterial spin labelling perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging with hybrid PET/MRI before treatment were retrospectively enrolled. The relative maximum standardized uptake value (rSUV(max)), relative maximum cerebral blood flow (rCBF(max)) and relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC(min)) in both the ET and NPR were calculated and compared between HGG and PCNSL. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the best logistic regression model (LRM) for classification. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to assess diagnostic performance. RESULTS: In the ET, HGG showed significantly lower rSUV(max) values but higher rCBF(max) and rADC(min) than PCNSL (all P < 0.05). In the PTR, HGG demonstrated significantly higher rSUV(max) and rCBF(max) but lower rADC(min) than PCNSL (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression based on quantitative parameters revealed that the LRM consisting of rSUV(max_ET), rADC(min_ET) and rCBF(max_PTR) had significantly improved diagnostic performance in differentiating HGG from PCNSL than single parameter alone, with an AUC of 0.980 and an accuracy of 95.4%. Multivariate logistic regression incorporating quantitative parameters and conventional MRI features revealed that the LRM consisting of rSUV(max_ET), rCBF(max_PTR) and enhancement pattern yielded a slightly higher AUC of 0.989 and an identical accuracy of 95.4%. No significant difference in AUCs was detected between the two LRMs (P = 0.233). CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric (18)F-FDG PET/MRI diagnostic model based on conventional MRI features and quantitative analysis of the enhancing tumors and peritumoral regions is superior to single parameter in the differentiation of HGG and PCNSL, which should be considered in the clinical practice.

Title: MGMT promoter methylation status shows no effect on [(18)F]FET uptake and CBF in gliomas: a stereotactic image-based histological validation study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status of gliomas on O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) uptake and cerebral blood flow (CBF) of arterial spin labeling (ASL), evaluated by hybrid PET/MR. Stereotactic biopsy was used to validate the findings. METHODS: A set of whole tumor and reference volumes of interest (VOIs) based on PET/FLAIR imaging were delineated and transferred to the corresponding [(18)F]FET PET and CBF maps in 57 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. The mean and max tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR) and normalized CBF (nCBF) were calculated. The predictive efficacy of [(18)F]FET PET and CBF in determining MGMT promoter methylation status of glioma were evaluated by whole tumor analysis and stereotactic biopsy. The correlation between PET/MR parameters and MGMT promoter methylation were analyzed using histological specimens acquired from multiple stereotactic biopsies. RESULTS: Based on the analysis of whole tumor volume and biopsy site, TBRmean, TBRmax, nCBFmean, and nCBFmax showed no statistically significant differences between gliomas with and without MGMT promoter methylation (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, stereotactic biopsy demonstrated that TBRmean, TBRmax, nCBFmean, and nCBFmax showed no correlation with MGMT promoter methylation (r = -0.117, p = 0.579; r = -0.161, p = 0.443; r = -0.271, p = 0.191; r = -0.300, p = 0.145; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status shows no effect on [(18)F]FET uptake and CBF of ASL in gliomas. Stereotactic biopsy validates it and further reveals there is no correlation of [(18)F]FET PET uptake and CBF with the percentages of MGMT promoter methylation. KEY POINTS: * Based on whole tumor VOI assessment, MGMT promoter methylation status shows no effect on [(18)F]FET uptake and CBF of ASL in gliomas. * For WHO grade IV glioblastomas, [(18)F]FET PET and ASL parameters based on hybrid PET/MR fail to predict the MGMT promoter methylation status. * Stereotactic image-based histology reveals that there is no correlation of [(18)F]FET PET uptake and CBF with the status and percentages of MGMT promoter methylation in gliomas.

Title: Preoperative [11C]methionine PET to personalize treatment decisions in patients with lower-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: PET with radiolabeled amino acids is used in the preoperative evaluation of patients with glial neoplasms. This study aimed to assess the role of [11C]methionine (MET) PET in assessing molecular features, tumor extent, and prognosis in newly diagnosed lower-grade gliomas (LGGs) surgically treated. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three patients with a new diagnosis of grade 2/3 glioma who underwent surgery at our Institution and were imaged preoperatively using [11C]MET PET/CT were retrospectively included. [11C]MET PET images were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively analyzed using tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). Progression-free survival (PFS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to test the association of clinicopathological and imaging data to PFS. RESULTS: Overall, 111 lesions (73%) were positive, while thirty-two (21%) and ten (6%) were isometabolic and hypometabolic at [11C]MET PET, respectively. [11C]MET uptake was more common in oligodendrogliomas than IDH-mutant astrocytomas (87% vs 50% of cases, respectively). Among [11C]MET-positive gliomas, grade 3 oligodendrogliomas had the highest median TBRmax (3.22). In 25% of patients, PET helped to better delineate tumor margins compared to MRI only. In IDH-mutant astrocytomas, higher TBRmax values at [11C]MET PET were independent predictors of shorter PFS. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the role of preoperative [11C]MET PET in estimating the type of suspected LGGs, assessing tumor extent, and predicting biological behavior and prognosis of histologically confirmed LGGs. Our findings support the implementation of [11C]MET PET in routine clinical practice to better manage these neoplasms.

Title: Metabolic characteristics of [(18)F]fluoroboronotyrosine (FBY) PET in malignant brain tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: [(18)F]fluoroboronotyrosine (FBY) is a large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT-1) dependent boron-derived tyrosine which has diagnostic and therapeutic potentiality. This study aimed to investigate the imaging characteristics of FBY positron emission tomography (PET) in malignant brain tumors. METHODS: A total of 35 patients with 36 lesions were prospectively enrolled for FBY positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three-dimensional region of interest was semiautomatically defined on MRI and coregistered to FBY PET images. Five quantitative parameters, namely, standardized uptake value (SUV) maximum (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion activity (TLA) and tumor-to-normal ratio (T/N ratio), were calculated. The mean and standard deviation values of the parameters in different circumstances were calculated, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to reveal the differences of FBY parameters. RESULTS: The maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of the normal brain were 0.119 +/- 0.030 and 0.038 +/- 0.017 in the study cohort. Majority of the neoplastic lesions displayed elevated FBY uptake, with SUVmax of 0.26 +/- 0.14, 3.00 +/- 0.61, 2.30 +/- 0.51, 2.62 +/- 0.36, and T/N ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.3, 22.6 +/- 6.6, 23.7 +/- 8.3, 20.2 +/- 3.8 for primary lower grade glioma (LGG), primary glioblastoma (GBM), recurrent diffuse glioma and metastatic brain tumor, respectively. Primary GBM showed significantly higher SUVmax, SUVmean and T/N ratio than primary LGG (p = 0.015-0.032). Meanwhile, 1 gliosis and 1 stable disease were also included and exhibited minimum FBY activity, with SUVmax of 0.17 and 0.33, T/N ratio of 1.04 and 2.58, respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated FBY activity can be seen in most malignant brain tumors, and primary GBM, recurrent glioma and metastatic brain tumor displayed significant tumor to background ratio, which may facilitate the malignancy stratification and future boron neutron capture therapy.

Title: Expression of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in the glial tumor recurrence evaluated in vivo using radionuclide imaging.
Abstract: Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP), also known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been found to be expressed in glioma vasculature in in-vitro studies. GCP expression can be traced with the use of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT used routinely for prostate cancer imaging. The aim of this paper was to analyze GCP expression in the recurrent glial tumors in vivo. 34 patients (pts.) aged 44.5 +/- 10.3 years with suspicion of recurrence of histologically confirmed glioma grade III (6 pts.) and grade IV (28 pts.) were included in the study. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced MR and [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. No radiopharmaceutical-related adverse events were noted. PET/CT was positive in all the areas suspected for recurrence at MR in all the patients. The recurrence was confirmed by histopathological examinations or follow-up imaging in all cases. The images showed a very low background activity of the normal brain. Median maximal standard uptake value (SUV(max)) of the tumors was 6.5 (range 0.9-15.6) and mean standard uptake value (SUV(mean)) was 3.5 (range 0.9-7.5). Target-to-background (TBR) ratios varied between 15 and 1400 with a median of 152. Target-to-liver background ratios (TLR) ranged from 0.2 to 2.6, the median TLR was 1.3. No significant difference of the measured parameters was found between the subgroups according to the glioma grade. High GCP expression in the recurrent glioma was demonstrated in-vivo with the use of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. As the treatment options in recurrent glioma are limited, this observation may open new therapeutic perspectives with the use of radiolabeled agents targeting the GCP.

Title: Discordant findings of different positron emission tomography/CT tracers in a case of glioblastoma.
Abstract: (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) CT has proven useful in the evaluation of high-grade glioma and is also useful as a predictor of the degree of malignancy in newly diagnosed brain tumors. It is commonly accepted that high-grade gliomas are characterized by increased FDG uptake, whereas the low-grade glioma demonstrates reduced or absent FDG uptake. [(18)F]-FDOPA is an amino acid PET tracer which is a marker of the proliferative activity of brain tumors and demonstrates positive uptake in all grades of brain tumors; however, the degree of tracer uptake is significantly higher in high-grade tumors as compared to low-grade tumors. Here, we discuss a case where both FDG and DOPA PET/CT scans raised suspicion of low-grade glioma; however, the final histopathology report confirmed WHO grade IV Glioblastoma.

Title: Maximum 11C-methionine PET uptake as a prognostic imaging biomarker for newly diagnosed and untreated astrocytic glioma.
Abstract: This study aimed whether the uptake of amino tracer positron emission tomography (PET) can be used as an additional imaging biomarker to estimate the prognosis of glioma. Participants comprised 56 adult patients with newly diagnosed and untreated World Health Organization (WHO) grade II-IV astrocytic glioma who underwent surgical excision and were evaluated by 11C-methionine PET prior to the surgical excision at Osaka City University Hospital from July 2011 to March 2018. Clinical and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed based on medical records at our institution. Preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) only influenced progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.41, p < 0.0001), whereas histology (anaplastic astrocytoma: HR 5.30, 95% CI 1.23-22.8, p = 0.025; glioblastoma: HR 11.52, 95% CI 2.27-58.47, p = 0.0032), preoperative KPS >/= 80 (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.62, p = 0.004), maximum lesion-to-contralateral normal brain tissue (LN max) >/= 4.03 (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.71, p = 0.01), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status (HR 14.06, 95% CI 1.81-109.2, p = 0.011) were factors influencing overall survival (OS) in multivariate Cox regression. OS was shorter in patients with LN max >/= 4.03 (29.3 months) than in patients with LN max < 4.03 (not reached; p = 0.03). OS differed significantly between patients with IDH mutant/LN max < 4.03 and patients with IDH mutant/LN max >/= 4.03. LN max using 11C-methionine PET may be used in prognostic markers for newly identified and untreated WHO grade II-IV astrocytic glioma.

Title: Relevance of Dynamic (18)F-DOPA PET Radiomics for Differentiation of High-Grade Glioma Progression from Treatment-Related Changes.
Abstract: This study evaluates the relevance of (18)F-DOPA PET static and dynamic radiomics for differentiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) progression from treatment-related changes (TRC) by comparing diagnostic performances to the current PET imaging standard of care. Eighty-five patients with histologically confirmed HGG and investigated by dynamic (18)F-FDOPA PET in two institutions were retrospectively selected. ElasticNet logistic regression, Random Forest and XGBoost machine models were trained with different sets of features-radiomics extracted from static tumor-to-background-ratio (TBR) parametric images, radiomics extracted from time-to-peak (TTP) parametric images, as well as combination of both-in order to discriminate glioma progression from TRC at 6 months from the PET scan. Diagnostic performances of the models were compared to a logistic regression model with TBR(mean) +/- clinical features used as reference. Training was performed on data from the first center, while external validation was performed on data from the second center. Best radiomics models showed only slightly better performances than the reference model (respective AUCs of 0.834 vs. 0.792, p < 0.001). Our current results show similar findings at the multicentric level using different machine learning models and report a marginal additional value for TBR static and TTP dynamic radiomics over the classical analysis based on TBR values.

Title: Glioma Imaging by O-(2-18F-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine PET and Diffusion-Weighted MRI and Correlation With Molecular Phenotypes, Validated by PET/MR-Guided Biopsies.
Abstract: Gliomas exhibit high intra-tumoral histological and molecular heterogeneity. Introducing stereotactic biopsy, we achieved a superior molecular analysis of glioma using O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). Patients underwent simultaneous DWI and FET-PET scans. Correlations between biopsy-derived tumor tissue values, such as the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)/exponential ADC (eADC) and histopathological diagnoses and those between relevant genes and TBR and ADC values were determined. Tumor regions with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mutation had higher TBR and lower ADC values. Tumor protein P53 mutation correlated with lower TBR and higher ADC values. alpha-thalassemia/mental-retardation-syndrome-X-linked gene (ATRX) correlated with higher ADC values. 1p/19q codeletion and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations correlated with lower ADC values. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations correlated with higher TBRmean values. No correlation existed between TBRmax/TBRmean/ADC/eADC values and phosphatase and tensin homolog mutations (PTEN) or O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Furthermore, TBR/ADC combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than each single imaging method for high-grade and IDH1-, hTERT-, and EGFR-mutated gliomas. This is the first study establishing the accurate diagnostic criteria for glioma based on FET-PET and DWI.

Title: "Aerobic glycolytic imaging" of human gliomas using combined pH-, oxygen-, and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To quantify abnormal metabolism of diffuse gliomas using "aerobic glycolytic imaging" and investigate its biological correlation. METHODS: All subjects underwent a pH-weighted amine chemical exchange saturation transfer spin-and-gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (CEST-SAGE-EPI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI. Relative oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) was estimated as the ratio of reversible transverse relaxation rate R(2)' to normalized relative cerebral blood volume. An aerobic glycolytic index (AGI) was derived by the ratio of pH-weighted image contrast (MTR(asym) at 3.0 ppm) to rOEF. AGI was compared between different tumor types (N = 51, 30 IDH mutant and 21 IDH wild type). Metabolic MR parameters were correlated with (18)F-FDG uptake (N = 8, IDH wild-type glioblastoma), expression of key glycolytic proteins using immunohistochemistry (N = 38 samples, 21 from IDH mutant and 17 from IDH wild type), and bioenergetics analysis on purified tumor cells (N = 7, IDH wild-type high grade). RESULTS: AGI was significantly lower in IDH mutant than wild-type gliomas (0.48 +/- 0.48 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.48; P = 0.03). AGI was strongly correlated with (18)F-FDG uptake both in non-enhancing tumor (Spearman, rho = 0.81; P = 0.01) and enhancing tumor (rho = 0.81; P = 0.01). AGI was significantly correlated with glucose transporter 3 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.004) and hexokinase 2 (rho = 0.73; P = 0.003) in IDH wild-type glioma, and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (rho = 0.59; P = 0.009) in IDH mutant glioma. Additionally, a significant correlation was found between AGI derived from bioenergetics analysis and that estimated from MRI (rho = 0.79; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: AGI derived from molecular MRI was correlated with glucose uptake ((18)F-FDG and glucose transporter 3/hexokinase 2) and cellular AGI in IDH wild-type gliomas, whereas AGI in IDH mutant gliomas appeared associated with monocarboxylate transporter density.

Title: L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) 1 expression in (18)F-FET-negative gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) is a highly sensitive PET tracer for glioma imaging, and its uptake is suggested to be driven by an overexpression of the L-type amino-acid transporter 1 (LAT1). However, 30% of low- and 5% of high-grade gliomas do not present enhanced (18)F-FET uptake at primary diagnosis ("(18)F-FET-negative gliomas") and the pathophysiologic basis for this phenomenon remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of LAT1 in a homogeneous group of newly diagnosed (18)F-FET-negative gliomas and to compare them to a matched group of (18)F-FET-positive gliomas. Forty newly diagnosed IDH-mutant astrocytomas without 1p/19q codeletion were evaluated (n = 20 (18)F-FET-negative (tumour-to-background ratio (TBR) < 1.6), n = 20 (18)F-FET-positive gliomas (TBR > 1.6)). LAT1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using SLC7A5/LAT1 antibody. The percentage of LAT1-positive tumour cells (%) and the staining intensity (range 0-2) were multiplied to an overall score (H-score; range 0-200) and correlated to PET findings as well as progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: IHC staining of LAT1 expression was positive in both, (18)F-FET-positive as well as (18)F-FET-negative gliomas. No differences were found between the (18)F-FET-negative and (18)F-FET-positive group with regard to percentage of LAT1-positive tumour cells, staining intensity or H-score. Interestingly, the LAT1 expression showed a significant negative correlation with the PFS (p = 0.031), whereas no significant correlation was found for TBR(max), neither in the overall group nor in the (18)F-FET-positive group only (p = 0.651 and p = 0.140). CONCLUSION: Although LAT1 is reported to mediate the uptake of (18)F-FET into tumour cells, the levels of LAT1 expression do not correlate with the levels of (18)F-FET uptake in IDH-mutant astrocytomas. In particular, the lack of tracer uptake in (18)F-FET-negative gliomas cannot be explained by a reduced LAT1 expression. A higher LAT1 expression in IDH-mutant astrocytomas seems to be associated with a short PFS. Further studies regarding mechanisms influencing the uptake of (18)F-FET are necessary.

Title: Fractal analysis of (11)C-methionine PET in patients with newly diagnosed glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The present study tested the possible utility of fractal analysis from L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) uptake in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas for differentiating glioma, especially in relation to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status, and as compared with the conventional standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters. METHODS: Investigations of MET PET/CT were performed retrospectively in 47 patients with newly diagnosed glioma. Tumors were divided into three groups: lower grade glioma (IDH1-mutant diffuse astrocytoma and IDH1-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma), higher grade glioma (IDH1-wildtype diffuse astrocytoma and IDH1-wildtype anaplastic astrocytoma), and glioblastoma. The fractal dimension for tumor, maximum SUV (SUVmax) for tumor (T) and mean SUV for normal contralateral hemisphere (N) were calculated, and the tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio was determined. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion MET uptake (TLMU) were also measured. RESULTS: There were significant differences in SUVmax (p = 0.006) and T/N ratio (p = 0.02) between lower grade glioma and glioblastoma. There were no significant differences among any of the three groups in MTV or TLMU. Significant differences were obtained in the fractal dimension between lower grade glioma and higher grade glioma (p = 0.006) and glioblastoma (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study in a small patient population suggest that the fractal dimension using MET PET in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas is useful for differentiating glioma, especially in relation to IDH1 mutation status, which has not been possible with SUV parameters.

Title: Combining (18)F-DOPA PET and MRI with perfusion-weighted imaging improves delineation of high-grade subregions in enhancing and non-enhancing gliomas prior treatment: a biopsy-controlled study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to compare spatial extent of high-grade subregions detected with combined [(18)F]-dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET and MRI to the one provided by advanced multimodal MRI alone including Contrast-enhanced (CE) and Perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). Then, we compared the accuracy between imaging modalities, in a per biopsy analysis. METHODS: Participants with suspected diffuse glioma were prospectively included between June 2018 and September 2019. Volumes of high-grade subregions were delineated respectively on (18)F-DOPA PET and MRI (CE and PWI). Up to three per-surgical neuronavigation-guided biopsies were performed per patient. RESULTS: Thirty-eight biopsy samples from sixteen participants were analyzed. Six participants (38%) had grade IV IDH wild-type glioblastoma, six (38%) had grade III IDH-mutated astrocytoma and four (24%) had grade II IDH-mutated gliomas. Three patients had intratumoral heterogeneity with coexisting high- and low-grade tumor subregions. High-grade volumes determined with combined (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI (median of 1.7 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.0, 19.1] mL) were larger than with multimodal MRI alone (median 1.3 [IQR 0.0, 12.8] mL) with low overlap (median Dice's coefficient 0.24 [IQR 0.08, 0.59]). Delineation volumes were substantially increased in five (31%) patients. In a per biopsy analysis, combined (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI detected high-grade subregions with an accuracy of 58% compared to 42% (p = 0.03) with CE MRI alone and 50% (p = 0.25) using multimodal MRI (CE + PWI). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of (18)F-DOPA PET to multimodal MRI (CE and PWI) enlarged the delineation volumes and enhanced overall accuracy for detection of high-grade subregions. Thus, combining (18)F-DOPA with advanced MRI may improve treatment planning in newly diagnosed gliomas.

Title: Diagnostic and Prognostic Potential of (18)F-FET PET in the Differential Diagnosis of Glioma Recurrence and Treatment-Induced Changes After Chemoradiation Therapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: MRI-based differential diagnosis of glioma recurrence (GR) and treatment-induced changes (TICs) remain elusive in up to 30% of treated glioma patients. We aimed to determine (18)F-FET PET diagnostic performance in this clinical scenario, its outcome dependency on established prognostic factors, optimal (18)F-FET semi-quantitative thresholds, and whether (18)F-FET parameters may instantly predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 45 glioma patients treated with chemoradiation therapy (32 males; mean age: 51 years, glioma grade: n=26 WHO4; n=15 WHO3; n=4 WHO2) who underwent (18)F-FET PET to resolve differential diagnosis of GR and TICs raised by MRI performed in the preceding 2 weeks and depicting any of the following changes in their radiation field: volumetric increase of contrast-enhancing lesions; new contrast-enhancing lesion; significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion without reducing corticosteroids. (18)F-FET PET outcome relied on evaluation of maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), time-to-peak (TTP), and time-activity curve pattern (TAC). Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total tumor metabolism (TTM) were calculated for prognostic purposes. Standard of reference was repeat MRI performed 4-6 weeks after the previous MRI. Non-parametric statistics tested (18)F-FET-based parameters for dependency on established prognostic markers. ROC curve analysis determined optimal cutoff values for (18)F-FET semi-quantitative parameters. (18)F-FET parameters and prognostic factors were evaluated for PFS and OS by Kaplan-Meier, univariate, and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: (18)F-FET PET sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value were 86.2, 81.3, 89.3, 76.5%, respectively; higher diagnostic accuracy was yielded in IDH-wild-type glioma patients compared to IDH-mutant glioma patients (sensitivity: 81.8 versus 88.9%; specificity: 80.8 versus 81.8%). KPS was the only prognostic factor differing according to (18)F-FET PET outcome (negative versus positive). Optimal (18)F-FET cutoff values for GR were TBRmax >/= 2.1, SUVmax >/= 3.5, and TTP </= 29 min. PFS differed based on (18)F-FET outcome and related metrics and according to KPS; a different OS was observed according to KPS only. On multivariate analysis, (18)F-FET PET outcome was the only significant PFS factor; KPS and age the only significant OS factors. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET PET demonstrated good diagnostic performance. (18)F-FET PET outcome and metrics were significantly predictive only for PFS.

Title: Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in recurrent high-grade gliomas: evaluating PSMA expression in vivo.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We planned this prospective study to evaluate PSMA expression in recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG), including anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma using Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-68 (HBED-CC)]- (Ga-68 PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), with its theranostic potential in mind. METHODS: This was a prospective study enrolling patients with clinical and MRI evidence of rHGG on follow-up. Three treated cases of HGG with RN on MRI were also included as negative controls. Abnormal tracer accumulation in the brain parenchyma, more than the contralateral hemisphere was interpreted as positive study. For semiquantitative analysis, a 3D spherical region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the site of the abnormal Ga-68 PSMA uptake, and the ratio of SUVmax of tumor (T) to SUVmax of the contralateral corresponding area (TBR) was calculated. Each patients' PSMA brain PET was fused to the corresponding MRI and reviewed for concordance. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in the study, a total of 49 lesions were detected on MRI, and fused PET/MR images showed increased Ga-68 PSMA uptake in all these lesions. Multifocal lesions were better appreciated on fused PET-MR images, and concordance between MRI and PET was 100 % for patient and lesion-wise detection. Recurrent glioma lesions showed SUVmax and SUVmean values (median and IQR) 6.0 (4.4-8.2) and 3.3 (2.8-3.7), respectively. Lesions labeled as radiation necrosis on MRI did not show tracer accumulation. CONCLUSION: Ga-68 PSMA has potential utility for evaluating recurrence in HGG and its potential for theranostics would encourage its use in the evaluation of these patients.

Title: Drug-resistant high grade glioma-related epilepsy surgery for focal motor status epilepticus localized by CT-PET imaging.
Abstract: Tumor-related epilepsy is a frequent complication of glioblastoma with seizures often representing the first manifestation of the malignancy. Though tumor resection is associated with improved seizure control, extensive surgery is not always feasible if eloquent cortex is involved in seizure generation and early propagation. We describe a case of a patient with glioblastoma with drug-resistant focal status epilepticus where fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging was successfully used to localize the seizure-onset and optimize tumor resection. This led to successful resection of hypermetabolic tumor tissue and resolution of focal status epilepticus without damage to eloquent cortex.

Title: (18)F-FET-PET-guided gross total resection improves overall survival in patients with WHO grade III/IV glioma: moving towards a multimodal imaging-guided resection.
Abstract: PURPOSE: PET using radiolabeled amino acid [(18)F]-fluoro-ethyl-(L)-tyrosine (FET-PET) is a well-established imaging modality for glioma diagnostics. The biological tumor volume (BTV) as depicted by FET-PET often differs in volume and location from tumor volume of contrast enhancement (CE) in MRI. Our aim was to investigate whether a gross total resection of BTVs defined as < 1 cm(3) of residual BTV (PET GTR) correlates with better oncological outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed imaging and survival data from patients with primary and recurrent WHO grade III or IV gliomas who underwent FET-PET before surgical resection. Tumor overlap between FET-PET and CE was evaluated. Completeness of FET-PET resection (PET GTR) was calculated after superimposition and semi-automated segmentation of pre-operative FET-PET and postoperative MRI imaging. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. RESULTS: From 30 included patients, PET GTR was achieved in 20 patients. Patients with PET GTR showed improved median OS with 19.3 compared to 13.7 months for patients with residual FET uptake (p = 0.007; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.12-0.76). This finding remained as independent prognostic factor after performing multivariate analysis (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.62, p = 0.006). Other survival influencing factors such as age, IDH-mutation, MGMT promotor status, and adjuvant treatment modalities were equally distributed between both groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PET GTR improves the OS in patients with WHO grade III or IV gliomas. A multimodal imaging approach including FET-PET for surgical planning in newly diagnosed and recurrent tumors may improve the oncological outcome in glioma patients.

Title: [(18)F] Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in Primary Brain Tumours: A Systematic Review.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This review aimed to summarize the available literature on the clinical application of [(18)F] FLT PET imaging in primary brain tumours. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy based on Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the Embase databases was carried on using the following search string: ('3; Fluorothymidine'/exp OR 'FLT' OR '[81F]-FLT' OR '[(18)F] Fluorothymidine') AND ('pet'/exp OR 'pet' OR 'positron emission tomography') AND ('glioma'/exp OR 'glioma' OR 'brain tumour'/exp OR 'brain tumour'). The search was updated till March 2021 and only articles in English and studies investigating the clinical applications of [(18)F] FLT PET and PET/CT in primary brain tumours were considered eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: The literature search ultimately yielded 52 studies included in the systematic review, with main results as follows: a) the uptake of [(18)F] FLT may guide stereotactic biopsy but does not discriminate between grade II and III glioma. b) [(18)F] FLT uptake and texture parameters correlate with overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed gliomas. c) In patients with recurrent glioma, proliferative volume (PV) and tumour-to-normal brain (T/N) uptake ratio are independent predictors of survival. d) Patients demonstrating response to therapy at [(18)F] FLT PET scan show longer OS compared to non-responders. e) [(18)F] FLT PET demonstrated good performance in discriminating tumour recurrence from radionecrosis. However, controversial results exist in comparative literature examining the performance of [(18)F] FLT vs. other radiotracers in the assessment of recurrence. CONCLUSION: [(18)F] FLT PET imaging has demonstrated potential benefits for grading, diagnostic and prognostic purposes, despite the small sample size studies due to the relatively low availability of the radiotracer.

Title: (18) F-FET PET maximum standard uptake value and WHO tumour classification grade in glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the area of oncology, molecular imaging techniques are becoming increasingly utilised. In neuro-oncology imaging, (18) Fluoro-O-(2) fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine ((18) F-FET) is one of the molecular tracers used in positron-emission tomography (PET). Here, we investigated the correlation between maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of (18) F-FET PET and histologically determined World Health Organization (WHO) grade in glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all (18) F-FET PET studies conducted between August 2014 and August 2019. Review was conducted to identify imaging studies performed on patients who had a glioma with histopathology results from surgical resection or biopsy available. RESULTS: A total of 31 (18) F-FET PET studies of histologically confirmed glioma were included. WHO grades ranged from II-IV. A positive correlation between maximum SUV uptake on (18) F-FET PET and WHO grade was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There was a correlation identified between WHO glioma grade and maximum SUV on (18) F-FET PET. Further studies are recommended to explore this relationship.

Title: Prediction of TERTp-mutation status in IDH-wildtype high-grade gliomas using pre-treatment dynamic [(18)F]FET PET radiomics.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate radiomic features extracted from standard static images (20-40 min p.i.), early summation images (5-15 min p.i.), and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET images for the prediction of TERTp-mutation status in patients with IDH-wildtype high-grade glioma. METHODS: A total of 159 patients (median age 60.2 years, range 19-82 years) with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic glioma (WHO grade III or IV) and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET prior to surgical intervention were enrolled and divided into a training (n = 112) and a testing cohort (n = 47) randomly. First-order, shape, and texture radiomic features were extracted from standard static (20-40 min summation images; TBR(20-40)), early static (5-15 min summation images; TBR(5-15)), and dynamic (time-to-peak; TTP) images, respectively. Recursive feature elimination was used for feature selection by 10-fold cross-validation in the training cohort after normalization, and logistic regression models were generated using the radiomic features extracted from each image to differentiate TERTp-mutation status. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value were calculated to illustrate diagnostic power in both the training and testing cohort. RESULTS: The TTP model comprised nine selected features and achieved highest predictability of TERTp-mutation with an AUC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.92) and sensitivity of 92.1% in the independent testing cohort. Weak predictive capability was obtained in the TBR(5-15) model, with an AUC of 0.61 (95% CI 0.42-0.80) in the testing cohort, while no predictive power was observed in the TBR(20-40) model. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics based on TTP images extracted from dynamic [(18)F]FET PET can predict the TERTp-mutation status of IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic high-grade gliomas with high accuracy preoperatively.

Title: (11)C-Methionine PET for Identification of Pediatric High-Grade Glioma Recurrence.
Abstract: Differentiating tumor recurrence or progression from pseudoprogression during surveillance of pediatric high-grade gliomas (PHGGs) using MRI, the primary imaging modality for evaluation of brain tumors, can be challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether (11)C-methionine PET, a molecular imaging technique that detects functionally active tumors, is useful for further evaluating MRI changes concerning for tumor recurrence during routine surveillance. Methods: Using (11)C-methionine PET during follow-up visits, we evaluated 27 lesions in 26 patients with new or worsening MRI abnormalities for whom tumor recurrence was of concern. We performed quantitative and qualitative assessments of both (11)C-methionine PET and MRI data to predict the presence of tumor recurrence. Further, to assess for an association with overall survival (OS), we plotted the time from development of the imaging changes against survival. Results: Qualitative evaluation of (11)C-methionine PET achieved 100% sensitivity, 60% specificity, and 93% accuracy to correctly predict the presence of tumors in 27 new or worsening MRI abnormalities. Qualitative MRI evaluation achieved sensitivity ranging from 86% to 95%, specificity ranging from 40% to 60%, and accuracy ranging from 85% to 89%. The interobserver agreement for (11)C-methionine PET assessment was 100%, whereas the interobserver agreement was only 50% for MRI (P < 0.01). Quantitative MRI and (11)C-methionine PET evaluation using receiver-operating characteristics demonstrated higher specificity (80%) than did qualitative evaluations (40%-60%). Postcontrast enhancement volume, metabolic tumor volume, tumor-to-brain ratio, and presence of tumor as determined by consensus MRI assessment were inversely associated with OS. Conclusion:(11)C-methionine PET has slightly higher sensitivity and accuracy for correctly predicting tumor recurrence, with excellent interobserver agreement, than does MRI. Quantitative (11)C-methionine PET can also predict OS. These findings suggest that (11)C-methionine PET can be useful for further evaluation of MRI changes during surveillance of previously treated PHGGs.

Title: A systematic review of the utility of amino acid PET in assessing treatment response to bevacizumab in recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Currently, bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic agent, is used as an adjunctive therapy to re-irradiation and surgery in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG). BEV has shown to decrease enhancement on MRI, but it is often unclear if these changes are due to tumor response to BEV or treatment-induced changes in the blood brain barrier. Preliminary studies show that amino acid PET can aid in distinguishing these changes on MRI. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of PubMed and Embase through July 2020 with the search terms 'bevacizumab' or 'Avastin' and 'recurrent glioma' and 'PET,' yielding 38 papers, with 14 meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Thirteen out of fourteen studies included in this review used static PET and three studies used dynamic PET to evaluate the use of BEV in rHGG. Six studies used the amino acid tracer [18F]FET, four studies used [11C]MET, and four studies used [18F]FDOPA. CONCLUSION: [18F]FET, [11C]MET, and [18F]FDOPA PET in combination with MRI have shown promising results for improving accuracy in diagnosing tumor recurrence, detecting early treatment failure, and distinguishing between tumor progression and treatment-induced changes in patients with rHGG treated with BEV.

Title: Determining the extent of tumor resection at surgical planning with (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT in patients with suspected glioma: multicenter phase III trials.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Glioma is the most common type of central nervous system tumor reported worldwide. Current imaging technologies have limitations in the diagnosis and assessment of glioma. The present study aimed to confirm the diagnostic efficacy and safety of anti-1-amino-3-[(18)F]fluorocyclobutane carboxylic acid ((18)F-fluciclovine; anti-[(18)F]FACBC) as a radiotracer for patients undergoing combined positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) for suspected glioma. METHODS: Combined data from two multicenter, open-label phase III clinical trials were evaluated for this study. The two trials enrolled patients with suspected high- or low-grade glioma on the basis of clinical symptoms, clinical course, and magnetic resonance imaging findings, and who were scheduled for tumor resection surgery. Patients fasted for >/= 4 h and received 2 mL of (18)F-fluciclovine (radioactivity dose 78.3-297.0 MBq), followed by a 10-min PET scan 10-50 min after injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was the positive predictive value (PPV) of the gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image negative [Gd (-)] and (18)F-fluciclovine PET-positive [PET ( +)] area of the scans, using the histopathological diagnosis of the tissue sampled from that area as the standard of truth. All adverse events reported during the study were recorded for safety analysis. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients aged 23-89 years underwent (18)F-fluciclovine PET; 31/45 patients (68.9%) were male, and 30/45 patients (66.7%) were suspected to have high-grade glioma. The PPV of (18)F-fluciclovine PET in the Gd (-) PET ( +) area was 88.0% (22/25 areas, 95% confidence interval: 70.0-95.8). The extent of planned tumor resection was modified in 47.2% (17/36 cases) after (18)F-fluciclovine PET scan, with an extension of area in 30.6% (11/36 cases) and reduction in 16.7% (6/36 cases). Furthermore, tissue samples collected from PET ( +) areas tended to have a higher malignancy grade compared with those from PET (-) areas. Overall, (18)F-fluciclovine was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT is useful for determining the extent of tumor resection at surgical planning, and may serve as a safe and effective diagnostic tool for patients with suspected glioma. TRIAL REGISTRATION: These trials were registered in the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trials Information (JapicCTI-152986, JapicCTI-152985).

Title: Brain FET PET tumor-to-white mater ratio to differentiate recurrence from post-treatment changes in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Highergrade glial neoplasms undergo standard treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating agents. There is often a clinical/neuroimaging dilemma in the post-treatment setting to differentiate disease recurrence from treatment-related changes. FET (fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine) PET has emerged as a molecular imaging modality for cases where MR imaging is inconclusive. This study aims to develop a cutoff on FET PET for differentiating true recurrence from post-treatment changes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed72 patientswith post-treatment grade 3 or 4 brain gliomas. Five to six mCi of (18) F-FET was injected and static imaging of the brain was performed at 20 min. A tumor-to-white matter (T/Wm) ratio was used as semiquantitative parameter. A T/Wm cutoff of 2.5 was used for image interpretation. Imaging findings were confirmed by either histopathologic diagnosis in a multidisciplinary joint clinic or based on follow-up of clinical and neuroimaging findings. RESULTS: Forty-one of 72 patients (57%) showed recurrent disease on FET PET. Thirty-five of them were confirmed to have tumor recurrence; six patients showed post-treatment changes. Thirty-one of 72 patients (43%) showed post-treatment changes on FET PET; 27 were confirmed as post-treatment change and four patients had tumor recurrence on subsequent MR imaging. An optimum T/Wm cutoff of 2.65 was derived based on receiver operating characteristic analysis with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 87.5%. CONCLUSION: Static FET PET can be used as problem-solving imaging modality with a T/Wm cutoff of 2.65 to differentiate late recurrence from post-treatment changes in grade 3 or 4 brain gliomas with equivocal MR features.

Title: [Clinical Findings of Thalamic and Brainstem Glioma Including Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3K27M Mutant:A Clinical Study].
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M mutant is a glioma located in the thalamus, brainstem, or spine with the H3K27M mutation, which is a new entity in the 2016 revised WHO classification. The treatment of thalamic glioma(TG)and brainstem glioma(BSG), which includes diffuse midline gliomas, the H3K27M mutant is challenging, and there are no standard therapeutic strategies. It is important to determine the characteristics of these brain tumors. Here, we retrospectively reviewed 31 consecutive patients with TG and BSG who were treated at our institute between January 1994 and May 2018, including methionine-positron emission tomography(MET-PET)data. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had TG, while 17 patients had BSG. Six patients were children, and 25 were adults. Nine patients with TGs and seven with BSG were enhanced by gadolinium. Twenty-seven patients were treated with radiotherapy, and 20 patients were treated with chemotherapy. All 21 tumors that underwent surgery showed wild-type IDH. The H3K27M mutation was present in four TG and two BSG. There was no statistically significant association between methionine uptake and gadolinium contrast enhancement and tumor grade. The median overall survival period(OS)of all cases was 16.9 months, whereas those of TG and BSG were 22.8 and 10.0 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because TG and BSG still have poor prognoses, it is necessary to elucidate the pathology of the disease and establish its standard therapy.

Title: Additive Value of Dynamic FDOPA PET/CT for Glioma Grading.
Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the value of the FDOPA PET kinetic parameters extracted using full kinetic analysis for tumor grading with neuronavigation-guided biopsies as reference in patients with newly-diagnosed gliomas. Methods: Fourteen patients with untreated gliomas were investigated. Twenty minutes of dynamic positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging and a 20-min static image 10 min after injection were reconstructed from a 40-min list-mode acquisition immediately after FDOPA injection. Tumors volume-of-interest (VOI) were generated based on the MRI-guided brain biopsies. Static parameters (TBRmax and TBRmean) and kinetic parameters [K1 and k2 using full kinetic analysis with the reversible single-tissue compartment model with blood volume parameter and the time-to-peak (TTP)] were extracted. Performances of each parameter for differentiating low-grade gliomas (LGG) from high-grade gliomas (HGG) were evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analyses (area under the curve; AUC). Results: Thirty-two tumoral VOI were analyzed. K1, k2, and TTP were significantly higher for HGG than for LGG (median K1-value = 0.124 vs. 0.074 ml/ccm/min, p = 0.025, median k2-value = 0.093 vs. 0.063 min(-1), p = 0.025, and median TTP-value = 10.0 vs. 15.0 min, p = 0.025). No significant difference was observed for the static parameters. The AUC for the kinetic parameters was higher than the AUC for the static parameters (respectively, AUC(K1) = 0.787, AUC(k2) = 0.785, AUC(TTP) = 0.775, AUC(TBRmax) = 0.551, AUC(TBRmean) = 0.575), significantly compared to TBRmax (respectively, p = 0.001 for K1, p = 0.031 for k2, and p = 0.029 for TTP). Conclusion: The present study suggests an additive value of FDOPA PET/CT kinetic parameters for newly-diagnosed gliomas grading.

Title: Hypoxia and glucose metabolism assessed by FMISO and FDG PET for predicting IDH1 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumor hypoxia and glycolysis have been recognized as determinant factors characterizing tumor aggressiveness in malignant gliomas. To clarify in vivo hypoxia and glucose metabolism in relation to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and chromosome 1p and 19q (1p/19q) codeletion status, we retrospectively analyzed hypoxia as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) and glucose metabolism as assessed by PET with [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. METHODS: In total, 87 patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant (WHO grade III and IV) gliomas were enrolled in this study. They underwent PET studies with FMISO and FDG before surgery. The molecular features and histopathological diagnoses based on the 2016 WHO classification were determined using surgical specimens. Maximal tumor-to-normal ratio (TNR) was calculated for FDG PET, and maximal tumor-to-blood SUV ratio (TBR) was calculated for FMISO PET. The PET uptake values in relation to IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In all tumors and malignant astrocytomas, the median FMISO TBR in IDH-wildtype tumors was significantly higher than that in IDH-mutant tumors (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve showed that the sensitivity for the discrimination was moderate (0.7-0.8) and the specificity was low (0.65-0.68). In the same population, the median FDG TNR in IDH-wildtype tumors tended to be higher than that in IDH-mutant tumors, but the difference was not statistically significant. In WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytomas, there were no significant differences in median FMISO TBR or FDG TNR between IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype tumors. In IDH-mutant WHO grade III anaplastic gliomas, there were no significant differences in median FMISO TBR or FDG TNR between anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor hypoxia as assessed by FMISO PET was informative for prediction of the IDH mutation status in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. However, the accuracy of the discrimination was not satisfactory for clinical application. On the other hand, glucose metabolism as assessed by FDG PET could not differentiate the IDH-mutant status. Moreover, PET studies using FMISO and FDG could not predict IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status in WHO grade III tumors.

Title: A pediatric cerebral tumor with MN1 alteration and pathological features mimicking carcinoma metastasis: may the terminology "high grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration" still be relevant?
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Astroblastoma, MN1-altered (old name: high-grade neuroepithelial tumor/HGNET with MN1 alteration) is a recently described central nervous system tumor mostly affecting pediatric patients and profoundly young girls. Differential pathological diagnoses of these tumors include ependymoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, meningioma, and even glioblastoma. As the treatment approaches to these tumors differ, it is essential to increase the awareness about these tumors in the neurosurgical community. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old female patient admitted with a 7-day history of headache, nausea, and vomiting. A contrasted MRI scan revealed a left parietal 4 x 4 x 5 cm mass with central necrosis and peripheral contrast enhancement. The tumor's histopathological findings were suggestive of a metastatic carcinoma with unknown primary, yet further genetic analysis revealed MN1 alteration. Peculiarly, the tumor pathomorphological features were not compatible with astroblastomas and exerted features strongly indicating a metastatic cancer; however, systemic PET and whole-body MRI failed to detect a primary malignancy. OUTCOME AND CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen months after gross-total tumor resection, an in-field and out-field multifocal recurrence developed which required a second surgery and subsequent chemo-radiotherapy. The patient is doing well for 1 year after the second treatment regimen at the time of this report. Despite the final cIMPACT6 classification in 2020 advised to define all MN1 altered brain tumors as astroblastomas, there exist prognostic differences in MN1-altered tumors with and without morphological features of astroblastoma. Rare morphological variants of MN1-altered tumors shall be recognized for their future prognostic and clinical classification. HGNET with MN1 alteration seems still be a more proper definition of such malignancies as an umbrella term.

Title: C-methionine-PET-guided Gamma Knife radiosurgery boost as adjuvant treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The most common glial tumor is the glioblastoma, and the prognosis remains dismal despite a multimodal therapeutic approach. The role of radiosurgery for the treatment of glioblastomas has been evaluated in several studies with some benefit at the recurrent stage. We evaluate the results of the protocol administered at the Gamma Knife unit administering radiosurgery as a boost to metabolic active parts of the tumor after the patient had completed traditional external beam radiotherapy (XBRT) as part of the Stupp protocol for high-grade gliomas. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery as a boost after receiving XBRT as part of the Stupp protocol. The target of radiation was determined according to the findings of the C-methionine PET scan in relation to magnetic resonance images. The primary end point of this study was to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) from the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 48.8 years and the mean Karnofsky performance score was 92.8%. The median PFS was 12.4 months. No radiation adverse effects were documented. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery is safe to use in the upfront treatment for these patients and appears to have a beneficial role in improving the PFS. This beneficial role seems to be conditioned not only by the time the treatment is administered but also where the radiation dose is targeted to.

Title: PSMA Expression in 122 Treatment Naive Glioma Patients Related to Tumor Metabolism in (11)C-Methionine PET and Survival.
Abstract: Apart from its expression in benign and malignant prostate tissue, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was shown to be expressed specifically in the neovasculature of solid tumors. For gliomas only little information exists. Therefore, we aimed to correlate PSMA expression in gliomas to tumor metabolism by L-[S-methyl-(11)C]methionine (MET) PET and survival. Therefore, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-R132H (IDH1-R132H) mutation and PSMA expression was performed on the paraffin embedded tissue samples of 122 treatment-naive glioma patients. The IHC results were then related to the pre-therapeutic semiquantitative MET PET data and patients' survival. Vascular PSMA expression was observed in 26 of 122 samples and was rather specific for high-grade gliomas ([HGG] 81% of glioblastoma multiforme, 10% of WHO grade III and just 2% of grade II gliomas). Significantly higher amounts of gliomas without verifiable IDH1-R132H mutation showed vascular PSMA expression. Significantly shorter median survival times were seen for patients with vascular PSMA staining in all tumors as well as HGG only. Additionally, significantly higher numbers of PSMA staining vessels were found in tumors with high amino acid metabolic rates. Vascular PSMA expression in gliomas was seen as a high-grade specific feature associated with elevated amino acid metabolism and short survival.

Title: (18)F-FET PET Uptake Characteristics of Long-Term IDH-Wildtype Diffuse Glioma Survivors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: IDHwt diffuse gliomas represent the tumor entity with one of the worst clinical outcomes. Only rare cases present with a long-term survival of several years. Here we aimed at comparing the uptake characteristics on dynamic (18)F-FET PET, clinical and molecular genetic parameters of long-term survivors (LTS) versus short-term survivors (STS): Methods: Patients with de-novo IDHwt glioma (WHO grade III/IV) and (18)F-FET PET prior to any therapy were stratified into LTS (>/=36 months survival) and STS (</=15 months survival). Static and dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters (mean/maximal tumor-to-background ratio (TBR(mean/max)), biological tumor volume (BTV), minimal time-to-peak (TTP(min))), diameter and volume of contrast-enhancement on MRI, clinical parameters (age, sex, Karnofksy-performance-score), mode of surgery; initial treatment and molecular genetics were assessed and compared between LTS and STS. RESULTS: Overall, 75 IDHwt glioma patients were included (26 LTS, 49 STS). LTS were significantly younger (p < 0.001), had a higher rate of WHO grade III glioma (p = 0.032), of O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation (p < 0.001) and missing Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERTp) mutations (p = 0.004) compared to STS. On imaging, LTS showed a smaller median BTV (p = 0.017) and a significantly longer TTP(min) (p = 0.008) on (18)F-FET PET than STS, while uptake intensity (TBR(mean/max)) did not differ. In contrast to the tumor-volume on PET, MRI-derived parameters such as tumor size as well as all other above-mentioned parameters did not differ between LTS and STS (p > 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: Besides molecular genetic prognosticators, a long survival time in IDHwt glioma patients is associated with a longer TTP(min) as well as a smaller BTV on (18)F-FET PET at initial diagnosis. (18)F-FET uptake intensity as well as the MRI-derived tumor size (volume and maximal diameter) do not differ in patients with long-term survival.

Title: BLZ945 derivatives for PET imaging of colony stimulating factor-1 receptors in the brain.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The kinase colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) has recently been identified as a novel therapeutic target for decreasing tumor associated macrophages and microglia load in cancer treatment. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a high-grade cancer in the brain with extremely poor prognosis, macrophages and microglia can make up to 50% of the total tumor mass. Currently, no non-invasive methods are available for measuring CSF-1R expression in vivo. The aim of this work is to develop a PET tracer for imaging of CSF-1R receptor expression in the brain for future GBM patient selection and treatment monitoring. METHODS: BLZ945 and a derivative that potentially allows for fluorine-18 labeling were synthesized and evaluated in vitro to determine their affinity towards CSF-1R. BLZ945 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 by N-methylation of des-methyl-BLZ945 using [(11)C]CH(3)I. Following administration to healthy mice, metabolic stability of [(11)C]BLZ945 in blood and brain and activity distribution were determined ex vivo. PET scanning was performed at baseline, efflux transporter blocking, and CSF-1R blocking conditions. Finally, [(11)C]BLZ945 binding was evaluated in vitro by autoradiography on mouse brain sections. RESULTS: BLZ945 was the most potent compound in our series with an IC(50) value of 6.9 +/- 1.4 nM. BLZ945 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 in 20.7 +/- 1.1% decay corrected radiochemical yield in a 60 min synthesis procedure with a radiochemical purity of >95% and a molar activity of 153 +/- 34 GBq.mumol(-1). Ex vivo biodistribution showed moderate brain uptake and slow wash-out, in addition to slow blood clearance. The stability of BLZ945 in blood plasma and brain was >99% at 60 min post injection. PET scanning demonstrated BLZ945 to be a substrate for efflux transporters. High brain uptake was observed, which was shown to be mostly non-specific. In accordance, in vitro autoradiography on brain sections revealed high non-specific binding. CONCLUSIONS: [(11)C]BLZ945, a CSF-1R PET tracer, was synthesized in high yield and purity. The tracer has high potency for the target, however, future studies are warranted to address non-specific binding and tracer efflux before BLZ945 or derivatives could be translated into humans for brain imaging.

Title: Fully automated analysis combining [(18)F]-FET-PET and multiparametric MRI including DSC perfusion and APTw imaging: a promising tool for objective evaluation of glioma progression.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of fully automated analysis of multimodal imaging data using [(18)F]-FET-PET and MRI (including amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging and dynamic-susceptibility-contrast (DSC) perfusion) in differentiation of tumor progression from treatment-related changes in patients with glioma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At suspected tumor progression, MRI and [(18)F]-FET-PET data as part of a retrospective analysis of an observational cohort of 66 patients/74 scans (51 glioblastoma and 23 lower-grade-glioma, 8 patients included at two different time points) were automatically segmented into necrosis, FLAIR-hyperintense, and contrast-enhancing areas using an ensemble of deep learning algorithms. In parallel, previous MR exam was processed in a similar way to subtract preexisting tumor areas and focus on progressive tumor only. Within these progressive areas, intensity statistics were automatically extracted from [(18)F]-FET-PET, APTw, and DSC-derived cerebral-blood-volume (CBV) maps and used to train a Random Forest classifier with threefold cross-validation. To evaluate contribution of the imaging modalities to the classifier's performance, impurity-based importance measures were collected. Classifier performance was compared with radiology reports and interdisciplinary tumor board assessments. RESULTS: In 57/74 cases (77%), tumor progression was confirmed histopathologically (39 cases) or via follow-up imaging (18 cases), while remaining 17 cases were diagnosed as treatment-related changes. The classification accuracy of the Random Forest classifier was 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.93 (sensitivity 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-0.97; specificity 0.71, 95% CI 0.44-0.9), significantly above the no-information rate of 0.77 (p = 0.03), and higher compared to an accuracy of 0.82 for MRI (95% CI 0.72-0.9), 0.81 for [(18)F]-FET-PET (95% CI 0.7-0.89), and 0.81 for expert consensus (95% CI 0.7-0.89), although these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.1 for all comparisons, McNemar test). [(18)F]-FET-PET hot-spot volume was single-most important variable, with relevant contribution from all imaging modalities. CONCLUSION: Automated, joint image analysis of [(18)F]-FET-PET and advanced MR imaging techniques APTw and DSC perfusion is a promising tool for objective response assessment in gliomas.

Title: [Dynamic11C-methionine PET/CT in differential diagnosis of brain gliomas].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possibilities of dynamic preoperative (11)C-methionine (MET) PET/CT in differential diagnosis of various types of brain gliomas in adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 74 patients aged 48+/-14 years with supratentorial gliomas: Grade IV - glioblastoma (GB, n=33), Grade III - anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AOD, n=10) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, n=12), Grade II - diffuse astrocytoma (DA, n=13) and oligodendroglioma (OD, n=6). All patients underwent standard MRI and dynamic MET PET/CT within 20 minutes after intravenous injection of radiopharmaceutical. Then, we compared MRI and PET/CT data and comprehensively analyzed the early stages of time-activity curve using 2 parameters: the first pass peak (FPP) and the first peak of maximum uptake (Pmax). RESULTS: We have significantly distinguished high-grade tumors (GB and AA+AOD) and certain benign gliomas (DA and OD) (p<0.05). AUC was over 0.7 and 0.8 for FPP and Pmax in differential diagnosis of various gliomas, respectively. We found that difficulties in differential diagnosis of gliomas arise mainly if oligodendrogliomas are included in the control group. CONCLUSION: Dynamic PET/CT with analysis of FPP and Pmax increases specificity of differential diagnosis of various gliomas compared to standard static imaging. These data are valuable for choice of optimal treatment strategy, as well as fundamental research of metabolic processes and vascularization of various tumors.

Title: Fluorescence real-time kinetics of protoporphyrin IX after 5-ALA administration in low-grade glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induces fluorescence in high-grade glioma (HGG), which is used for resection. However, the value of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unclear. Time dependency and time kinetics have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate real-time kinetics of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in LGG based on hyperspectral fluorescence-based measurements and identify factors that predict fluorescence. METHODS: Patients with grade II gliomas and imaging from which HGGs could not be completely ruled out received 5-ALA at 20 mg/kg body weight 4 hours prior to surgery. Fluorescence intensity (FI) and PpIX concentration (CPpIX) were measured in tumor tissue utilizing a hyperspectral camera. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based tumor cell density, Ki-67/MIB-1 index, chromosomal 1p/19q codeletion, and 18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET values and their role for predicting fluorescence were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-one biopsies from 25 patients were included. Tissues with fluorescence demonstrated FI and CPpIX maxima between 7 and 8 hours after administration. When visible fluorescence was observed, peaks of FI and CPpIX were observed within this 7- to 8-hour time frame, regardless of any MRI gadolinium contrast enhancement. Gadolinium enhancement (p = 0.008), Ki-67/MIB-1 index (p < 0.001), 18F-FET PET uptake ratio (p = 0.004), and ADC-based tumor cellularity (p = 0.017) significantly differed between fluorescing and nonfluorescing tissue, but not 1p/19q codeletions. Logistic regression demonstrated that 18F-FET PET uptake and Ki-67/MIB-1 index were independently related to fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a fluorescence-based assessment of CPpIX in human LGG tissues related to 18F-FET PET uptake and Ki-67/MIB-1. As in HGGs, fluorescence in LGGs peaked between 7 and 8 hours after 5-ALA application, which has consequences for the timing of administration.

Title: Worse prognosis for IDH wild-type diffuse gliomas with larger residual biological tumor burden.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The association of overall survival (OS) with tumor burden, including contrast enhanced (CE) volume on CE T1-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense volume, and 3, 4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) hypermetabolic volume, in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type gliomas remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between biological tumor burden in pre- and post-operative status and OS in IDH wild-type gliomas, and evaluated which volume was the best predictor of OS. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with treatment-naive IDH wild-type gliomas (WHO grade II 6, III 15, IV 13) were retrospectively included. Three pre-operative tumor regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented based on the CE, FLAIR hyperintense, and FDOPA hypermetabolic regions. Resected ROIs were segmented from the post-operative images. Residual CE, FLAIR hyperintense, and FDOPA hypermetabolic ROIs were created by subtracting resected ROIs from pre-operative ROIs. Cox regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of OS with the volume of each ROI, and Akaike information criterion was used to assess the fitness. RESULTS: Residual CE volume had a significant association with OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, p = 0.039], but this effect disappeared when controlling for tumor grade. Residual FDOPA hypermetabolic volume best fit the regression model and was significantly associated with OS (HR = 1.18, p = 0.008), even when controlling for tumor grade. FLAIR hyperintense volume showed no significant association with OS. CONCLUSION: Residual FDOPA hypermetabolic burden predicted OS for IDH wild-type gliomas, regardless of the tumor grade. Furthermore, removing hypermetabolic and CE regions may improve the prognosis.

Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of PET for Differentiating True Glioma Progression From Post Treatment-Related Changes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PET with different radiotracers and parameters in differentiating between true glioma progression (TPR) and post treatment-related change (PTRC). Methods: Studies on using PET to differentiate between TPR and PTRC were screened from the PubMed and Embase databases. By following the PRISMA checklist, the quality assessment of included studies was performed, the true positive and negative values (TP and TN), false positive and negative values (FP and FN), and general characteristics of all the included studies were extracted. Results of PET consistent with reference standard were defined as TP or TN. The pooled sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves (HSROC) were generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Results: The 33 included studies had 1,734 patients with 1,811 lesions suspected of glioma recurrence. Fifteen studies tested the accuracy of (18)F-FET PET, 12 tested (18)F-FDG PET, seven tested (11)C-MET PET, and three tested (18)F-DOPA PET. (18)F-FET PET showed a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93) and 0.78 (0.69, 0.85), respectively. In the subgroup analysis of FET-PET, diagnostic accuracy of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) was higher than that of mixed-grade gliomas (P (interaction) = 0.04). (18)F-FDG PET showed a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.83) and 0.87 (0.80, 0.92), the Spe of the HGGs group was lower than that of the low-grade gliomas group (0.82 vs. 0.90, P = 0.02). (11)C-MET PET had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.96) and 0.78 (0.69, 0.86). (18)F-DOPA PET had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.89) and 0.70 (0.60, 0.79). FET-PET combined with MRI had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) and 0.76 (0.57, 0.88). Multi-parameters analysis of FET-PET had pooled Sen and Spe values of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92) and 0.79 (0.63, 0.89). Conclusion: PET has a moderate diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between TPR and PTRC. The high Sen of amino acid PET and high Spe of FDG-PET suggest that the combination of commonly used FET-PET and FDG-PET may be more accurate and promising, especially for low-grade glioma.

Title: Lesion-Function Analysis from Multimodal Imaging and Normative Brain Atlases for Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Cognitive deficits are common in glioma patients following multimodality therapy, but the relative impact of different types and locations of treatment-related brain damage and recurrent tumors on cognition is not well understood. In 121 WHO Grade III/IV glioma patients, structural MRI, O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine FET-PET, and neuropsychological testing were performed at a median interval of 14 months (range, 1-214 months) after therapy initiation. Resection cavities, T1-enhancing lesions, T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, and FET-PET positive tumor sites were semi-automatically segmented and elastically registered to a normative, resting state (RS) fMRI-based functional cortical network atlas and to the JHU atlas of white matter (WM) tracts, and their influence on cognitive test scores relative to a cohort of matched healthy subjects was assessed. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities presumably caused by radiation therapy covered more extensive brain areas than the other lesion types and significantly impaired cognitive performance in many domains when affecting left-hemispheric RS-nodes and WM-tracts as opposed to brain tissue damage caused by resection or recurrent tumors. Verbal episodic memory proved to be especially vulnerable to T2/FLAIR abnormalities affecting the nodes and tracts of the left temporal lobe. In order to improve radiotherapy planning, publicly available brain atlases, in conjunction with elastic registration techniques, should be used, similar to neuronavigation in neurosurgery.

Title: Glioma Biopsy Based on Hybrid Dual Time-Point FET-PET/MRI-A Proof of Concept Study.
Abstract: Neuroimaging based on O-[2-(18F)fluoroethyl]-l-tyrosine (FET)-PET provides additional information on tumor grade and extent compared with MRI. Dynamic PET for biopsy target selection further improves results but is often clinically impractical. Static FET-PET performed at two time-points may be a good compromise, but data on this approach are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the histology of lesions obtained from two challenging glioma patients with targets selected based on hybrid dual time-point FET-PET/MRI. Five neuronavigated tumor biopsies were performed in two difficult cases of suspected glioma. Lesions with (T1-CE) and without contrast enhancement (T1 and T2-FLAIR) on MRI were selected. Dual time-point FET-PET imaging was performed 5-15 min (PET10) and 45-60 min (PET60) after radionuclide injection. The most informative FET-PET/MRI images were coregistered with MRI in time of biopsy planning. Five biopsy targets (three from high uptake and two from moderate uptake FET areas) thought to represent the most malignant sites and tumor extent were selected. Histopathological findings were compared with FET-PET and MRI images. Increased FET uptake in the area of non-CE locations on MRI correlated well with high-grade gliomas localized as far as 3 cm from T1-CE foci. Selecting a target in the motor cortex based on FET kinetics defined by dual time-point PET resulted in a grade IV diagnosis after previous negative biopsies based on MRI. An additional grade III diagnosis was obtained from an area of glioma infiltration with moderate FET uptake (between 1 and 1.25 SUV). These findings seem to show that dual time-point FET-PET-based biopsies can provide additional and clinically useful information for glioma diagnosis. Selection of targets based on dual time-point images may be useful for determining the most malignant tumor areas and may therefore be useful for resection and radiotherapy planning.

Title: PET/CT using (68) Ga-PSMA-617 versus (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose to differentiate low- and high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare and characterize metabolic features of high- and low-grade glioma tumors using (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent both (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG PET/CT over 2 consecutive days and then underwent surgical treatment were retrospectively identified. All tumors were diagnosed histologically. This report includes 16 high-grade glioma (HGG) and 14 low-grade glioma (LGG) tumors. Standard uptake value (SUV) and target to nontarget (T/NT) were quantitatively investigated through the entire tumor region. Statistical analyses were performed using area under the curve (AUC) and comparison of two means. RESULTS: SUV(max) and SUV(mean) were the most effective (AUC, 0.96 and 0.94 for PSMA PET; AUC, 0.79 and 0.74 for FDG PET, respectively) for differentiating HGGs from LGGs. These methods distinguished between HGG and LGG effectively (PSMA PET: SUV(max) , 5.766 +/- 3.945 vs. 0.7364 +/- 0.5295, p < 0.0001; SUV(mean) , 1.666 +/- 1.680 and 0.1514 +/- 0.1534, p < 0.0001, respectively) (FDG PET: SUV(max) , 11.67 +/- 3.639 and 9.118 +/- 6.612; SUV(mean) , 5.648 +/- 2.114 and 4.435 +/- 2.872; p = 0.0083, 0.0262, respectively). The Youden index for SUV(max) and SUV(mean) of (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG were 0.82 and 0.79 and 0.54 and 0.61, separately. T/NT(max) was helpful for visual inspection of (68) Ga-PSMA-617-PET images (T/NT(max) : 1.291 +/- 0.9553 in grade II, 5.25 +/- 2.435 in grade III, and 13.61 +/- 13.84 in grade IV). T/NT(max) differed significantly between LGG and HGG and between subtypes of LGG. CONCLUSION: PET/CT with (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and (18) F-FDG may help distinguish between HGG and LGG, and (68) Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT is superior to(18) F-FDG in differentiating HGG and LGG.

Title: Simultaneous Mapping of Vasculature, Hypoxia, and Proliferation Using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI, (18)F-FMISO PET, and (18)F-FLT PET in Relation to Contrast Enhancement in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Conventional MRI plays a key role in the management of patients with high-grade glioma, but multiparametric MRI and PET tracers could provide further information to better characterize tumor metabolism and heterogeneity by identifying regions having a high risk of recurrence. In this study, we focused on proliferation, hypervascularization, and hypoxia, all factors considered indicative of poor prognosis. They were assessed by measuring uptake of (18)F-3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, and uptake of (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO), respectively. For each modality, the volumes and high-uptake subvolumes (hot spots) were semiautomatically segmented and compared with the contrast enhancement (CE) volume on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (T1w-Gd) images, commonly used in the management of patients with glioblastoma. Methods: Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI (31 patients), (18)F-FLT PET (20 patients), or (18)F-FMISO PET (20 patients), for a total of 31 patients, was performed on preoperative glioblastoma patients. Volumes and hot spots were segmented on SUV maps for (18)F-FLT PET (using the fuzzy locally adaptive bayesian algorithm) and (18)F-FMISO PET (using a mean contralateral image + 3.3 SDs) and on rCBV maps (using a mean contralateral image + 1.96 SDs) for dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI and overlaid on T1w-Gd images. For each modality, the percentages of the peripheral volumes and the peripheral hot spots outside the CE volume were calculated. Results: All tumors showed highly proliferated, hypervascularized, and hypoxic regions. The images also showed pronounced heterogeneity of both tracers regarding their uptake and rCBV maps, within each individual patient. Overlaid volumes on T1w-Gd images showed that some proliferative, hypervascularized, and hypoxic regions extended beyond the CE volume but with marked differences between patients. The ranges of peripheral volume outside the CE volume were 1.6%-155.5%, 1.5%-89.5%, and 3.1%-78.0% for (18)F-FLT, rCBV, and (18)F-FMISO, respectively. All patients had hyperproliferative hot spots outside the CE volume, whereas hypervascularized and hypoxic hot spots were detected mainly within the enhancing region. Conclusion: Spatial analysis of multiparametric maps with segmented volumes and hot spots provides valuable information to optimize the management and treatment of patients with glioblastoma.

Title: Targeting glioblastoma using a novel peptide specific to a deglycosylated isoform of brevican.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest form of brain tumor and remains amongst the most difficult cancers to treat. Brevican (Bcan), a central nervous system (CNS)-specific extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in high-grade glioma cells, including GBM. A Bcan isoform lacking most glycosylation, dg-Bcan, is found only in GBM tissues. Here, dg-Bcan is explored as a molecular target for GBM. In this study, we screened a d-peptide library to identify a small 8-amino acid dg-Bcan-Targeting Peptide (BTP) candidate, called BTP-7 that binds dg-Bcan with high affinity and specificity. BTP-7 is preferentially internalized by dg-Bcan-expressing patient-derived GBM cells. To demonstrate GBM targeting, we radiolabeled BTP-7 with (18)F, a radioisotope of fluorine, and found increased radiotracer accumulation in intracranial GBM established in mice using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. dg-Bcan is an attractive molecular target for GBM, and BTP-7 represents a promising lead candidate for further development into novel imaging agents and targeted therapeutics.

Title: TERT-Promoter Mutational Status in Glioblastoma - Is There an Association With Amino Acid Uptake on Dynamic (18)F-FET PET?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The mutation of the 'telomerase reverse transcriptase gene promoter' (TERTp) has been identified as an important factor for individual prognostication and tumorigenesis and will be implemented in upcoming glioma classifications. Uptake characteristics on dynamic (18)F-FET PET have been shown to serve as additional imaging biomarker for prognosis. However, data on the correlation of TERTp-mutational status and amino acid uptake on dynamic (18)F-FET PET are missing. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether static and dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters are associated with the TERTp-mutational status in de-novo IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and whether a TERTp-mutation can be predicted by dynamic (18)F-FET PET. METHODS: Patients with de-novo IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, available TERTp-mutational status and dynamic (18)F-FET PET scan prior to any therapy were included. Here, established clinical parameters maximal and mean tumor-to-background-ratios (TBR(max)/TBR(mean)), the biological-tumor-volume (BTV) and minimal-time-to-peak (TTP(min)) on dynamic PET were analyzed and correlated with the TERTp-mutational status. RESULTS: One hundred IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients were evaluated; 85/100 of the analyzed tumors showed a TERTp-mutation (C228T or C250T), 15/100 were classified as TERTp-wildtype. None of the static PET parameters was associated with the TERTp-mutational status (median TBR(max) 3.41 vs. 3.32 (p=0.362), TBR(mean) 2.09 vs. 2.02 (p=0.349) and BTV 26.1 vs. 22.4 ml (p=0.377)). Also, the dynamic PET parameter TTP(min) did not differ in both groups (12.5 vs. 12.5 min, p=0.411). Within the TERTp-mutant subgroups (i.e., C228T (n=23) & C250T (n=62)), the median TBR(max) (3.33 vs. 3.69, p=0.095), TBR(mean) (2.08 vs. 2.09, p=0.352), BTV (25.4 vs. 30.0 ml, p=0.130) and TTP(min) (12.5 vs. 12.5 min, p=0.190) were comparable, too. CONCLUSION: Uptake characteristics on dynamic (18)F-FET PET are not associated with the TERTp-mutational status in glioblastoma However, as both, dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters as well as the TERTp-mutation status are well-known prognostic biomarkers, future studies should investigate the complementary and independent prognostic value of both factors in order to further stratify patients into risk groups.

Title: Imaging Surveillance of Gliomas: Role of Basic and Advanced Imaging Techniques.
Abstract: It is essential to be aware of widely accepted criteria for grading of treatment response in both high-grade and low-grade gliomas. These criteria primarily take into account responses of measurable and nonmeasurable lesions on T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and postcontrast images to determine a final category of response for the patient. The additional role that other advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion and perfusion imaging, can play in the surveillance of these tumors is discussed in this article.

Title: Salvage Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for Malignant Brain Tumor Patients in Compliance with Emergency and Compassionate Use: Evaluation of 34 Cases in Taiwan.
Abstract: Although boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising treatment option for malignant brain tumors, the optimal BNCT parameters for patients with immediately life-threatening, end-stage brain tumors remain unclear. We performed BNCT on 34 patients with life-threatening, end-stage brain tumors and analyzed the relationship between survival outcomes and BNCT parameters. Before BNCT, MRI and (18)F-BPA-PET analyses were conducted to identify the tumor location/distribution and the tumor-to-normal tissue uptake ratio (T/N ratio) of (18)F-BPA. No severe adverse events were observed (grade >/= 3). The objective response rate and disease control rate were 50.0% and 85.3%, respectively. The mean overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) times were 7.25, 7.80, and 4.18 months, respectively. Remarkably, the mean OS, CSS, and RFS of patients who achieved a complete response were 17.66, 22.5, and 7.50 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified the optimal BNCT parameters and tumor characteristics of these patients, including a T/N ratio >/= 4, tumor volume < 20 mL, mean tumor dose >/= 25 Gy-E, MIB-1 </= 40, and a lower recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class. In conclusion, for malignant brain tumor patients who have exhausted all available treatment options and who are in an immediately life-threatening condition, BNCT may be considered as a therapeutic approach to prolong survival.

Title: [Phosphorus MR spectroscopy and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the study of energy metabolism of glial tumors].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study energy metabolism in glial tumors using dynamic MR spectroscopy and (18)F-FDG PET/CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 19 patients (9 women and 10 men) with newly diagnosed supratentorial glial tumors WHO Grade I-IV (diffuse astrocytoma - 4 cases, oligodendroglioma - 4 cases, anaplastic astrocytoma - 5 cases, glioblastoma - 6 cases). All patients underwent examination and surgical treatment at the Burdenko Neurosurgery Center. Dynamic MR spectroscopy and (18)F-FDG PET/CT were applied in each patient. RESULTS: We found multiple correlations between the ratio of bioorganic phosphate peaks and parameters of glucose uptake by tumor tissue. These relationships were more significant in patients with high-grade tumors: positive significant correlation between SUVtumor and PME/PCr ratio (R(S)=0.75, p=0.01), T/Nmix and betaATP/Pi ratio (R(s)=0.76, p=0.02), SUVpeaktumor and aATP/Pi ratio (R(S)=0.77, p=0.008). Moreover, there were negative correlations between SUVtumor and PCr/bATP ratio (R(S)= -0.66, p=0.05), T/Nmix and PDE/bATP ratio (R(S)= -0.83, p=0.006), SUVpeaktumor and PDE/aATP ratio (R(S)= -0.76, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: High-grade gliomas were characterized by higher glucose consumption, ATP release (intensification of energy metabolism) and faster cell membrane synthesis. These processes indicate enhanced proliferation of tumor cells (intensification of plastic metabolism).

Title: Non-invasive assessment of heterogeneity of gliomas using diffusion and perfusion MRI: correlation with spatially co-registered PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity of gliomas challenges the neuronavigated biopsy and oncological therapy. Diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal the cellular and hemodynamic heterogeneity of tumors. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI is expected to be a non-invasive imaging approach to characterizing glioma. PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and spatially co-registered maximal standard uptake value (SUV(max)) for tissue characterization and glioma grading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed gliomas were retrospectively investigated. The relative minimum ADC (rADC(min)), relative maximal ADC (rADC(max)), relative maximal rCBV (rCBV(max)), the relative minimum rCBV (rCBV(min)), and the corresponding relative SUVmax (rSUV(max)) were measured. The paired t-test was used to compare the quantitative parameters between different regions to clarify tumor heterogeneity. Imaging parameters between WHO grade IV and grade II/III gliomas were compared by t-test. The diagnostic efficiency of multiparametric PET/MRI was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The values of rSUV(max) were significantly different between maximal diffusion/perfusion area and minimum diffusion/perfusion area (P < 0.001/P < 0.001) within tumor. The values of rADC(min) (P < 0.001), rCBV(max) (P = 0.002), and corresponding rSUV(max) (P = 0.001/P < 0.001) could be used for grading gliomas. The areas under the ROC curves of rSUV(max) defined by rADC(min) and rCBV(max) were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSION: Diffusion and perfusion MRI can detect glioma heterogeneity with excellent molecular imaging correlations. Regions with rCBV(max) suggest tissues with the highest metabolism and malignancy for guiding glioma grading and tissue sampling.

Title: PET Imaging in Neurodegeneration and Neuro-oncology: Variants and Pitfalls.
Abstract: In neurodegenerative diseases, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays an important role in the early identification and differential diagnosis in particular in clinically challenging patients. (18)F-FDG is still the most widely used and established tracer in this patient group, with different cortical and subcortical regions being preferentially affected in different neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease or Lewy Body dementia, resulting in typical hypometabolic patterns. Over the last decades, however, the implementation of tracers specific for the pathological deposits characteristic of the different diseases, such as amyloid and tau, has revolutionized the way of classifying and reporting cases of cognitive impairment of neurodegenerative origin, providing complementary information to (18)F-FDG PET. In neuro-oncology, PET imaging can be performed in several clinical indications, as highlighted in the joint European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM)/European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)/Response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) practice guidelines on imaging in neuro-oncology. For assessment of glioma, amino-acid analogues, such as (11)C-methionine or (18)F-FET, are used whenever clinically available, as they offer excellent tumor-to-background ratios in malignant tumors. Moreover, dynamic acquisition of amino-acid analogue tracers and assessment of the shape of the time-activity curve can be used to perform noninvasive grading of brain gliomas, differentiating low from high grade presentations. In both settings, however, thorough knowledge of the normal physiological tracer distribution and the variants and pitfalls that can occur during image acquisition, processing and interpretation is mandatory in order to provide optimal diagnostic information to referring physicians and patients. Especially in neuro-oncology, this process can be aided by the active use of coregistered magnetic resonance imaging to accurately identify the imaging correlates of developmental origin, acute and chronic stroke, inflammation, infection and seizure related activity.

Title: Initial Results of a Phase 2 Trial of (18)F-DOPA PET-Guided Dose-Escalated Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Our previous work demonstrated that 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) is sensitive and specific for identifying regions of high density and biologically aggressive glioblastoma. The purpose of this prospective phase 2 study was to determine the safety and efficacy of biologic-guided, dose-escalated radiation therapy (DERT) using (18)F-DOPA PET in patients with glioblastoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma aged >/=18 years without contraindications to (18)F-DOPA were eligible. Target volumes included 51, 60, and 76 Gy in 30 fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost, and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide for 6 months. (18)F-DOPA PET imaging was used to guide DERT. The study was designed to detect a true progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months (PFS6) rate >/=72.5% in O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated patients (DE-Un), with an overall significance level (alpha) of 0.20 and a power of 80%. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for PFS and overall survival (OS). Historical controls (HCs) included 139 patients (82 unmethylated) treated on prospective clinical trials or with standard RT at our institution. Toxicities were evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. RESULTS: Between January 2014 and December 2018, 75 evaluable patients were enrolled (39 DE-Un, 24 methylated [DE-Mth], and 12 indeterminate). PFS6 for DE-Un was 79.5% (95% confidence interval, 63.1%-90.1%). Median PFS was longer for DE-Un patients compared with historical controls (8.7 months vs 6.6 months; P = .017). OS was similarly longer, but the difference was not significant (16.0 vs 13.5 months; P = .13). OS was significantly improved for DE-Mth patients compared with HC-Mth (35.5 vs 23.3 months; P = .049) despite nonsignificant improvement in PFS (10.7 vs 9.0 months; P = .26). Grade 3 central nervous system necrosis occurred in 13% of patients, but treatment with bevacizumab improved symptoms in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-DOPA PET-guided DERT appears to be safe, and it significantly improves PFS in MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. OS is significantly improved in MGMT methylated patients. Further investigation of (18)F-DOPA PET biologic guided DERT for glioblastoma is warranted.

Title: 18F-FAZA PET/CT in pretreatment assessment of hypoxic status in high-grade glioma: correlation with hypoxia immunohistochemical biomarkers.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation between 18F-labeled fluoroazomycinarabinoside (18F-FAZA) PET data and hypoxia immunohistochemical markers in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study including 20 patients with brain MRI suggestive for HGG and undergoing 18F-FAZA PET/CT before treatment for hypoxia assessment. For each 18F-FAZA PET scan SUVmax, SUVmean and 18F-FAZA tumour volume (FTV) at 40, 50 and 60% threshold of SUVmax were calculated; hypoxic volume was estimated by applying different thresholds (1.2, 1.3 and 1.4) to tumour/blood ratio. Seventeen patients were analysed. The immunohistochemical analysis assessed the following parameters: hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), glucose transporter-1, tumour vascularity and Ki-67. RESULTS: 18F-FAZA PET showed a single lesion in 15/17 patients and multiple lesions in 2/17 patients. Twelve/17 patients had grade IV glioma and 5/17 with grade III glioma. Bioptic and surgical samples have been analysed separately. In the surgical subgroup (n = 7) a positive correlation was observed between CA-IX and SUVmax (P = 0.0002), SUVmean40 (P = 0.0058), SUVmean50 (P = 0.009), SUVmean60 (P = 0.0153), FTV-40-50-60 (P = 0.0424) and hypoxic volume1.2-1.3-1.4 (P = 0.0058). In the bioptic group (n = 10) tumour vascularisation was inversely correlated with SUVmax (P = 0.0094), SUVmean40 (P = 0.0107), SUVmean50 (P = 0.0094) and SUVmean60 (P = 0.0154). CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of 18F-FAZA PET parameters with CD31 and CA-IX represents a reliable method for assessing tumour hypoxia in HGG. The inverse correlation between tumour vascularisation, SUVmax and SUVmean suggest that highly vascularized tumours might present more oxygen supply than hypoxia.

Title: [(18)F]-FDHT PET/CT as a tool for imaging androgen receptor expression in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: G lioblastoma (GBM) is associated with poor overall survival. Recently, we showed that androgen receptor (AR) protein is overexpressed in 56% of GBM specimens and AR antagonists induced dose-dependent death in several GBM cell lines and significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged the lifespan of mice implanted with human GBM. 16beta-18F-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ([(18)F]-FDHT) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer used to detect AR expression in prostate and breast cancers. This study was aimed at exploring the ability of [(18)F]-FDHT-PET to detect AR expression in high-grade gliomas. METHODS: Twelve patients with suspected high-grade glioma underwent a regular workup and additional dynamic and static [(18)F]-FDHT-PET/CT. Visual and quantitative analyses of [(18) F]-FDHT kinetics in the tumor and normal brain were performed. Mean and maximum (max) standardized uptake values (SUVs) were determined in selected volumes of interest. The patients had surgery or biopsy after PET/CT. AR protein was analyzed in the tumor samples by western blot. Fold change in AR expression was calculated by densitometry analysis. Correlation between imaging and AR protein samples was determined. RESULTS: In six of the 12 patients, [(18) F]-FDHT uptake was significantly higher in the tumor than in the normal brain. These patients also had increased AR protein expression within the tumor. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis for the tumor-to-control normal brain uptake ratio in terms of SUV(mean) versus AR protein expression was positive and significant (R = 0.84; P = .002). CONCLUSION: [(18) F]-FDHT-PET/CT could identify increased AR expression in high-grade glioma.

Title: High Grade Glioma Treatment in Elderly People: Is It Different Than in Younger Patients? Analysis of Surgical Management Guided by an Intraoperative Multimodal Approach and Its Impact on Clinical Outcome.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Age is considered a negative prognostic factor for High Grade Gliomas (HGGs) and many neurosurgeons remain skeptical about the benefits of aggressive treatment. New surgical and technological improvements may allow extended safe resection, with lower level of post-operative complications. This opportunity opens the unsolved question about the most appropriate HGG treatment in elderly patients. The aim of this study is to analyze if HGG maximal safe resection guided by an intraoperative multimodal imaging protocol coupled with neuromonitoring is associated with differences in outcome in elderly patients versus younger ones. METHODS: We reviewed 100 patients, 53 (53%) males and 47 (47%) females, with median (IQR) age of 64 (57; 72) years. Eight patients were diagnosed with Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA), 92 with Glioblastoma (GBM). Surgery was aimed to achieve safe maximal resection. An intraoperative multimodal imaging protocol, including neuronavigation, neurophysiological monitoring, 5-ALA fluorescence, (11)C MET-PET, navigated i-US system and i-CT, was used, and its impact on EOTR and clinical outcome in elderly patients was analyzed. We divided patients in two groups according to their age: <65 and >65 years, and surgical and clinical results (EOTR, post-operative KPS, OS and PFS) were compared. Yet, to better understand age-related differences, the same patient cohort was also divided into <70 and >70 years and all the above data reanalyzed. RESULTS: In the first cohort division, we did not found KPS difference over time and survival analysis did not show significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.36 for OS and p = 0.49 for PFS). Same results were obtained increasing the age cut-off for age up to 70 years (p = 0.52 for OS and p = 0.92 for PFS). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that there is not statistically significant difference in post-operative EOTR, KPS, OS, and PFS between younger and elderly patients treated with extensive tumor resection aided by a intraoperative multimodal protocol.

Title: Preferential tumor localization in relation to (18)F-FDOPA uptake for lower-grade gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Although tumor localization and 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) uptake may have an association, preferential tumor localization in relation to FDOPA uptake is yet to be investigated in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). This study aimed to identify differences in the frequency of tumor localization between FDOPA hypometabolic and hypermetabolic LGGs using a probabilistic radiographic atlas. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with newly diagnosed LGG (WHO grade II, 29; III, 22; isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type, 21; mutant 1p19q non-codeleted,16; mutant codeleted, 14) who underwent FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET) were retrospectively selected. Semiautomated tumor segmentation on FLAIR was performed. Patients with LGGs were separated into two groups (FDOPA hypometabolic and hypermetabolic LGGs) according to the normalized maximum standardized uptake value of FDOPA PET (a threshold of the uptake in the striatum) within the segmented regions. Spatial normalization procedures to build a 3D MRI-based atlas using each segmented region were validated by an analysis of differential involvement statistical mapping. RESULTS: Superimposition of regions of interest showed a high number of hypometabolic LGGs localized in the frontal lobe, while a high number of hypermetabolic LGGs was localized in the insula, putamen, and temporal lobe. The statistical mapping revealed that hypometabolic LGGs occurred more frequently in the superior frontal gyrus (close to the supplementary motor area), while hypermetabolic LGGs occurred more frequently in the insula. CONCLUSION: Radiographic atlases revealed preferential frontal lobe localization for FDOPA hypometabolic LGGs, which may be associated with relatively early detection.

Title: Persistent Nontumoral High-Amino-Acid Uptake on Brain [11C]Methionine PET/CT in a Patient After Combined Glioma Treatment.
Abstract: A 44-year-old man after combined left temporal low-grade glioma treatment presented with daily multiple series of seizures. MRI demonstrated diffuse cortical swelling in the left frontal lobe with intensive gyral enhancement. PET with [11C]methionine (PET-MET) revealed increased radiotracer uptake strictly confined to the cortical ribbon of the left cerebral hemisphere, which persisted for 3 months. Tumor recurrence was suggested, and biopsy was performed. No evidence of recurrent tumor was found. During a 2-year follow-up, a diffuse gyral enhancement in the left hemisphere has persisted on MRI; PET has shown high [11C]methionine uptake in the left frontal and parietal cortex with gradual positive dynamics.

Title: Dynamic 18F-Fluoro-Ethyl-Tyrosine Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography: A Better Predictor of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutation in Presurgical Evaluations of Glioma.
Abstract: The recent WHO classification of gliomas has incorporated molecular markers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion into the ambit of morphological diagnosis, and 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) has shown its utility in noninvasive glioma grading and prognosis. Both dynamic and static FET PET parameters may assist in predicting the IDH mutational status, but time to peak derived from dynamic data may be a better predictor for IDH status. We present a case of left frontal lobe lesion suggestive of high-grade glioma on magnetic resonance imaging and static (18)F-FET PET images, however, dynamic FET image was suggestive of low-grade IDH1-mutated glioma which was later confirmed on histology and immunohistochemistry.

Title: Advanced imaging techniques for neuro-oncologic tumor diagnosis, with an emphasis on PET-MRI imaging of malignant brain tumors.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will explore the latest in advanced imaging techniques, with a focus on the complementary nature of multiparametric, multimodality imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). RECENT FINDINGS: Advanced MRI techniques including perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and MR chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) offer significant advantages over conventional MR imaging when evaluating tumor extent, predicting grade, and assessing treatment response. PET performed in addition to advanced MRI provides complementary information regarding tumor metabolic properties, particularly when performed simultaneously. (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET improves the specificity of tumor diagnosis and evaluation of post-treatment changes. Incorporation of radiogenomics and machine learning methods further improve advanced imaging. The complementary nature of combining advanced imaging techniques across modalities for brain tumor imaging and incorporating technologies such as radiogenomics has the potential to reshape the landscape in neuro-oncology.

Title: Benefit of Static FET PET in Pretreated Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients with Equivocal Conventional MRI Results.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: MRI has shortcomings in differentiation between tumor tissue and post-therapeutic changes in pretreated brain tumor patients. PATIENTS: We assessed 22 static FET-PET/CT-scans of 17 pediatric patients (median age 12 years, range 2-16 years, ependymoma n=4, medulloblastoma n=4, low-grade glioma n=6, high-grade glioma n=3, germ cell tumor n=1, choroid plexus tumor n=1, median follow-up: 112 months) with multimodal treatment. METHOD: FET-PET/CT-scans were analyzed visually by 3 independent nuclear medicine physicians. Additionally quantitative FET-Uptake for each lesion was determined by calculating standardized uptake values (SUVmaxT/SUVmeanB, SUVmeanT/SUVmeanB). Histology or clinical follow-up served as reference. RESULTS: Static FET-PET/CT reliably distinguished between tumor tissue and post-therapeutic changes in 16 out of 17 patients. It identified correctly vital tumor tissue in 13 patients and post-therapeutic changes in 3 patients. SUV-based analyses were less sensitive than visual analyses. Except from a choroid plexus carcinoma, all tumor entities showed increased FET-uptake. DISCUSSION: Our study comprises a limited number of patients but results corroborate the ability of FET to detect different brain tumor entities in pediatric patients and discriminate between residual/recurrent tumor and post-therapeutic changes. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a clear benefit from additional static FET-PET/CT-scans when conventional MRI identified equivocal lesions in pretreated pediatric brain tumor patients. These results warrant prospective studies that should include dynamic scans.

Title: (18)F-Boramino acid PET/CT in healthy volunteers and glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: In this work, the safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of large neutral amino acid transporter type-1 (LAT-1) targeting PET tracer (18)F-trifluorobborate-derived tyrosine (denoted as (18)F-FBY) has been investigated. It is designed as a first-in-human study in healthy volunteers and to assay LAT-1 expression level in glioma patients. METHODS: Six healthy volunteers (3 M, 3 F) underwent whole-body PET acquisitions at multiple time points after bolus injection of (18)F-FBY. Regions of interest (ROIs) were mapped manually on major organs, and then the time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained. Dosimetry was calculated with the OLINDA/EXM software. Thirteen patients who were suspected of glioma were scanned with PET/CT at 30 min after (18)F-FBY injection. Within 7 days after PET/CT, the tumor was removed surgically, and LAT-1 immunohistochemical staining for LAT-1 was performed on tumor samples and correlated with (18)F-FBY PET imaging. RESULTS: (18)F-FBY was well tolerated by all healthy volunteers, and no adverse symptoms were observed or reported. (18)F-FBY is rapidly cleared from the blood circulation and excreted mainly through the kidneys and urinary tract. The effective dose (ED) was 0.0039 +/- 0.0006 mSv/MBq. In 14 surgical confirmed gliomas (one of the patiens had two gliomas), (18)F-FBY uptake increased consistently with tumor grade, with maximum standard uptake values (SUV(max)) of 0.28 +/- 0.14 and 2.84 +/- 0.46 and tumor-to-normal contralateral activity (T/N) ratio of 2.30 +/- 1.26 and 24.56 +/- 6.32 in low- and high-grade tumors, respectively. In addition to the significant difference in the uptakes between low- and high-grade gliomas (P < 0.001), the immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positive correlations between the SUV(max), LAT-1 expression (r(2) = 0.80, P < 0.001), and Ki-67 labeling index (r(2) = 0.79, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FBY is a PET tracer with favorable dosimetry profile and pharmacokinetics. It has the potential to assay LAT-1 expression in glioma patients and may provide imaging guidance for further boron neutron capture therapy of gliomas.

Title: Safety and interim survival data after intracranial administration of M032, a genetically engineered oncolytic HSV-1 expressing IL-12, in pet dogs with sporadic gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of glioma remains disheartening in the clinical realm. While a multitude of studies and trials have shown promise, improvements in overall survival have been disappointing. Modeling these tumors in the laboratory setting has become increasingly challenging, given their complex in situ behavior and interactions for therapeutic evasion. Dogs, particularly brachycephalic breeds, are known to spontaneously develop gliomas that resemble human gliomas both clinically and pathophysiologically, making canines with sporadic tumors promising candidates for study. Typically, survival among these dogs is approximately 2 months with palliation alone. METHODS: The authors have completed the first stage of a unique phase I dose-escalating canine clinical trial in which the safety and tolerability of M032, a nonneurovirulent oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 vector genetically engineered to express interleukin-12, are being studied in pet dogs with gliomas undergoing maximum safe tumor resection and inoculation of the cavity with the viral infusate. RESULTS: Twenty-five canine patients were enrolled between January 2018 and August 2020. One patient was electively withdrawn from the trial by its owner, and 3 did not receive the virus. For the 21 dogs that remained, 13 had high-grade gliomas, 5 had low-grade gliomas, and 3 were undetermined. According to histopathological analysis, 62% of the tumors were oligodendrogliomas. At the time of this report, the median overall survival from the date of treatment was 151 days (+/- 78 days). No significant adverse events attributable to M032 or dose-limiting toxicities have been observed to date. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest study of oncolytic viral therapy for canine brain tumors to date, treatment with M032 did not cause harm and the combination of surgery and oncolytic viral therapy may have contributed to prolonged survival in pet dogs with spontaneous gliomas. Forthcoming in-depth radiographic, immunohistochemical, and genetic analyses will afford a more advanced understanding of how this treatment impacts these tumors and the immune system. Our goal is to utilize these findings bitranslationally to inform human studies and refine therapies that will improve outcomes in both humans and pet dogs with gliomas.

Title: Heterogeneous parameters based on (18)F-FET PET imaging can non-invasively predict tumor grade and isocitrate dehydrogenase gene 1 mutation in untreated gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to explore the efficacy of easily obtained intratumoral heterogeneous parameters, other than regular semi-quantitative parameters, based on static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in glioma grade and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene 1 mutation prediction. METHODS: Fifty-eight adult patients with untreated glioma (grades II-IV) who underwent preoperative (18)F-FET PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging were enrolled in the present study. Eight semi-automatically obtained static PET imaging parameters after lesion delineation were chosen for analysis. These were: maximal tumor-to-background ratio (TBRmax), peak tumor-to-background ratio (TBRpeak), mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBRmean), coefficient of variation (COV), heterogeneity index (HI), the standard deviation of lesion standardized uptake value (SUVsd), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion tracer standardized uptake (TLU). Pathological and immunohistochemical results were used as a reference. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to investigate the predictive efficacy of these parameters in glioma grade and IDH1 mutation status. RESULTS: TLU [area under the curve (AUC): 0.841, P<0.0001], TBRpeak (AUC: 0.832, P<0.0001), and HI (AUC: 0.826, P<0.0001) had the top 3 single-parameter predictive performance between grade II or III and grade IV glioma patients. Combinations of TBRmax, SUVsd, and TBRmean (AUC: 0.850, P<0.0001); HI, SUVsd, and MTV (AUC: 0.848, P<0.0001); and HI, SUVsd, and TLU (AUC: 0.848, P<0.0001) had the top 3 multiple-parameter predictive performance. SUVsd (AUC: 0.710, P=0.0028), TLU (AUC: 0.698, P=0.0074), and HI (AUC: 0.676, P=0.0159) had the top 3 single-parameter predictive performance in the IDH1 genotype. Combinations of TBRmax, SUVsd, and TBRmean (AUC: 0.821, P<0.0001); SUVsd and TBRmean (AUC: 0.804, P<0.0001); and SUVsd, HI, and TBRmean (AUC: 0.799, P<0.0001) had the top 3 multiple-parameter predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: These easily obtained and highly repetitive heterogeneous parameters based on static (18)F-FET PET/CT imaging can non-invasively predict glioma grade and IDH1 mutation, crucial in treatment planning, and prognostic evaluation.

Title: Recurrent high-grade glioma surgery: a multimodal intraoperative protocol to safely increase extent of tumor resection and analysis of its impact on patient outcome.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: No consensus exists on the best treatment for recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG), particularly in terms of surgical indications, and scant data are available on the integrated use of multiple technologies to overcome intraoperative limits and pitfalls related to artifacts secondary to previous surgery and radiotherapy. Here, the authors report on their experience with the integration of multiple intraoperative tools in recurrent HGG surgery, analyzing their pros and cons as well as their effectiveness in increasing the extent of tumor resection. In addition, they present a review of the relevant literature on this topic. METHODS: The authors reviewed all cases in which recurrent HGG had been histologically diagnosed after a first surgery and the patient had undergone a second surgery involving neuronavigation with MRI, intraoperative CT (iCT), 11C-methionine-positron emission tomography (11C-MET-PET), 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), and intraoperative navigated ultrasound (iUS). All cases were classified according to tumor functional grade (1, noneloquent area; 2, near an eloquent area; 3, eloquent area). RESULTS: Twenty patients with recurrent HGG were operated on using a multimodal protocol. The recurrent tumor functional grade was 1 in 4 patients, 2 in 8 patients, and 3 in the remaining 8 patients. In all patients but 2, 100% EOTR was obtained. Intraoperative 5-ALA fluorescence and navigated iUS showed low specificity and sensitivity. iCT detected tumor remnants in 3 cases. Postoperatively, 6 patients (30%) had worsening neurological conditions: 4 recovered within 90 days, 1 partially recovered, and 1 experienced a permanent deficit. The median Karnofsky Performance Status remained substantially unchanged over the follow-up period. The mean progression-free survival after the second surgery was 7.7 months (range 2-11 months). The mean overall survival was 25.4 months (range 10-52 months), excluding 2 long survivors. Two patients died within 60 days after surgery, and 3 patients were still under follow-up at the end of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the integration of neuronavigation, 5-ALA fluorescence, iUS, iCT, 11C-MET-PET, and IOM during microsurgical resection of recurrent glioma. The authors believe that the proposed multimodal protocol is useful to increase the safety, effectiveness, and EOTR in patients with recurrent HGG and brain alterations secondary to radio- and chemotherapy.

Title: Dynamic (18)F-FDOPA-PET/MRI for the preoperative evaluation of gliomas: correlation with stereotactic histopathology.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: MRI alone has limited accuracy for delineating tumor margins and poorly predicts the aggressiveness of gliomas, especially when tumors do not enhance. This study evaluated simultaneous 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA)-PET/MRI to define tumor volumes compared to MRI alone more accurately, assessed its role in patient management, and correlated PET findings with histopathology. METHODS: Ten patients with known or suspected gliomas underwent standard of care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy. FDOPA-PET/MRI was performed prior to surgery, allowing for precise co-registration of PET, MR, and biopsies. The biopsy sites were modeled as 5-mm spheres, and the local FDOPA uptake at each site was determined. Correlations were performed between measures of tumor histopathology, and static and dynamic PET values: standardized uptake values (SUVs), tumor to brain ratios, metabolic tumor volumes, and tracer kinetics at volumes of interest (VOIs) and biopsy sites. RESULTS: Tumor FDOPA-PET uptake was visualized in 8 patients. In 2 patients, tracer uptake was similar to normal brain reference with no histological findings of malignancy. Eight biopsy sites confirmed for glioma had FDOPA uptake without T1 contrast enhancement. The PET parameters were highly correlated only with the cell proliferation marker, Ki-67 (SUV(max): r = 0.985, P = .002). In this study, no statistically significant difference between high-grade and low-grade tumors was demonstrated. The dynamic PET analysis of VOIs and biopsy sites showed decreasing time-activity curves patterns. FDOPA-PET imaging directly influenced patient management. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous FDOPA-PET/MRI allowed for more accurate visualization and delineation of gliomas, enabling more appropriate patient management and simplified validation of PET findings with histopathology.

Title: Choroid Plexus as the Best Reference Region for Standardized Uptake Value Analysis on C11-Acetate PET/CT for Grading and Predicting Prognosis in Patients with Cerebral Gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to compare different reference regions and select one with the most clinical relevance on C11-acetate (ACE) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with cerebral glioma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients with cerebral glioma who underwent baseline ACE PET/CT at diagnosis. Other than the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the primary tumor, SUVs of the reference regions including the normal gray matter, white matter, choroid plexus, and cerebellum were measured. Then, the SUV ratio (SUV(R) = tumor SUV(max)/reference region SUV(mean)) was calculated. The effect of patient age on the SUV(mean) of each reference was examined and the SUV(Rs) of each reference region were compared between grades. age, sex, tumor size, histological grades, SUV(R), and the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation were included for survival analyses. RESULTS: Except for the cerebellum showing a mild negative correlation, we found no correlations between age and SUV(mean) using the gray matter, white matter, and choroid plexus (r = - 0.280, P = 0.047). Only the SUV(R)-choroid plexus was able to differentiate between the WHO grades (Grade II vs. III, P = 0.035; grade III vs. IV, P < 0.001; grade II vs. IV, P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models found that the SUVR-choroid plexus and IDH mutation were statistically significant for predicting OS. CONCLUSION: Of the different reference regions used for grading cerebral gliomas, the choroid plexus was found to be the most optimal. In addition, the SUV ratio is useful to predict the overall survival in the model with the choroid plexus as a reference region.

Title: Sequential implementation of DSC-MR perfusion and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET allows efficient differentiation of glioma progression from treatment-related changes.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-)-l-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) PET are both applied to discriminate tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related changes (TRC) in patients with suspected recurrent glioma. While the combination of both methods has been reported to improve the diagnostic accuracy, the performance of a sequential implementation has not been further investigated. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the diagnostic value of consecutive PWI and [(18)F]FET PET. METHODS: We evaluated 104 patients with WHO grade II-IV glioma and suspected TP on conventional MRI using PWI and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET. Leakage corrected maximum relative cerebral blood volumes (rCBV(max)) were obtained from dynamic susceptibility contrast PWI. Furthermore, we calculated static (i.e., maximum tumor to brain ratios; TBR(max)) and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET parameters (i.e., Slope). Definitive diagnoses were based on histopathology (n = 42) or clinico-radiological follow-up (n = 62). The diagnostic performance of PWI and [(18)F]FET PET parameters to differentiate TP from TRC was evaluated by analyzing receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Across all patients, the differentiation of TP from TRC using rCBV(max) or [(18)F]FET PET parameters was moderate (AUC = 0.69-0.75; p < 0.01). A rCBV(max) cutoff > 2.85 had a positive predictive value for TP of 100%, enabling a correct TP diagnosis in 44 patients. In the remaining 60 patients, combined static and dynamic [(18)F]FET PET parameters (TBR(max), Slope) correctly discriminated TP and TRC in a significant 78% of patients, increasing the overall accuracy to 87%. A subgroup analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant tumors indicated a superior performance of PWI to [(18)F]FET PET (AUC = 0.8/< 0.62, p < 0.01/>/= 0.3). CONCLUSION: While marked hyperperfusion on PWI indicated TP, [(18)F]FET PET proved beneficial to discriminate TP from TRC when PWI remained inconclusive. Thus, our results highlight the clinical value of sequential use of PWI and [(18)F]FET PET, allowing an economical use of diagnostic methods. The impact of an IDH mutation needs further investigation.

Title: Non-Invasive Prediction of IDH Mutation in Patients with Glioma WHO II/III/IV Based on F-18-FET PET-Guided In Vivo (1)H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Machine Learning.
Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 mutation is an important prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in glioma. Immunohistological and molecular diagnosis of IDH mutation status is invasive. To avoid tumor biopsy, dedicated spectroscopic techniques have been proposed to detect D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), the main metabolite of IDH, directly in vivo. However, these methods are technically challenging and not broadly available. Therefore, we explored the use of machine learning for the non-invasive, inexpensive and fast diagnosis of IDH status in standard (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). To this end, 30 of 34 consecutive patients with known or suspected glioma WHO grade II-IV were subjected to metabolic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) for optimized voxel placement in (1)H-MRS. Routine (1)H-magnetic resonance ((1)H-MR) spectra of tumor and contralateral healthy brain regions were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (3T-MR) scanner, prior to surgical tumor resection and molecular analysis of IDH status. Since 2-HG spectral signals were too overlapped for reliable discrimination of IDH mutated (IDHmut) and IDH wild-type (IDHwt) glioma, we used a nested cross-validation approach, whereby we trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) on the complete spectral information of the (1)H-MRS data to predict IDH status. Using this approach, we predicted IDH status with an accuracy of 88.2%, a sensitivity of 95.5% (95% CI, 77.2-99.9%) and a specificity of 75.0% (95% CI, 42.9-94.5%), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) amounted to 0.83. Subsequent ex vivo (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) measurements performed on metabolite extracts of resected tumor material (eight specimens) revealed myo-inositol (M-ins) and glycine (Gly) to be the major discriminators of IDH status. We conclude that our approach allows a reliable, non-invasive, fast and cost-effective prediction of IDH status in a standard clinical setting.

Title: Static (18)F-FET PET and DSC-PWI based on hybrid PET/MR for the prediction of gliomas defined by IDH and 1p/19q status.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of static O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography ((18)F-FET PET) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) for glioma grading and determining isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed gliomas who underwent simultaneous (18)F-FET PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) examinations on hybrid PET/MR were retrospectively enrolled. The mean and max tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR) and normalized CBV (nCBV) were calculated based on whole tumor volume segmentations with reference to PET/MR images. The predictive efficacy of FET PET and CBV in glioma according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: TBRmean, TBRmax, nCBVmean, and nCBVmax differed between low- and high-grade gliomas, with the highest AUC of nCBVmean (0.920). TBRmax and nCBVmean showed significant differences between gliomas with and without IDH mutation (p = 0.032 and 0.010, respectively). Furthermore, TBRmean, TBRmax, and nCBVmean discriminated between IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and IDH-mutated astrocytomas (p = 0.049, 0.034 and 0.029, respectively). The combination of TBRmax and nCBVmean showed the best predictive performance (AUC, 0.903). Only nCBVmean differentiated IDH-mutated with 1p/19q codeletion oligodendrogliomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas (p < 0.001) (AUC, 0.829), but none of the parameters discriminated between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. CONCLUSIONS: Both FET PET and DSC-PWI might be non-invasive predictors for glioma grades and IDH mutation status. FET PET combined with CBV could improve the differentiation of IDH-mutated astrocytomas and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. However, FET PET and CBV might be limited for identifying oligodendrogliomas. KEY POINTS: * Static (18)F-FET PET and DSC-PWI parameters differed between low- and high-grade gliomas, with the highest AUC of the mean value of normalized CBV. * Static (18)F-FET PET and DSC-PWI parameters based on hybrid PET/MR showed predictive value in identifying glioma IDH mutation subtypes, which have gained importance for both determining the diagnosis and prognosis of gliomas according to the 2016 WHO classification. * Static (18)F-FET PET and DSC-PWI parameters have limited potential in differentiating IDH-mutated with 1p/19q codeletion oligodendrogliomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas or IDH-mutated astrocytomas.

Title: Quantitative Features From CHO PET Distinguish the WHO Grades of Primary Diffuse Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the quantitative 18F-fluoroethylcholine (CHO) PET characteristics for differentiating lower-grade glioma (LGG) from glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients who underwent CHO PET with histopathologically confirmed primary diffuse glioma were prospectively enrolled. The 3-dimensional region of interest was semiautomatically defined based on the SUV threshold, and a total of 74 quantitative features, including 13 shape features, 31 SUV-based features, and 30 normalized SUV-based features, were calculated. Wilcoxon rank sum test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and correlation coefficient analyses were applied to select independent representative features, and patient prognosis was stratified by the World Health Organization (WHO) grade and CHO features. RESULTS: A total of 89.2% of the quantitative features were significantly different between LGG and GBM, and the SUV-based features displayed higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values than the other feature groups. Among the 5 traditional features, the SUVmax and the total lesion CHO uptake were the most distinguishing, with AUCs of 0.880 and 0.860 (0.938 and 0.927 after reclassification of 2 outliers), respectively, both of which could also stratify patient prognosis better than WHO grade. Five alternative features, including 2 shape features and 3 SUV-based features, were considered representative, with AUCs ranging from 0.754 to 0.854. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative features from CHO PET are reliable in determining the WHO grade of primary diffuse gliomas. Our findings suggest that GBM has a larger volume, a more spherical shape, higher choline activity in most interval segments, and a more symmetrical distribution than LGG.

Title: Visualization of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Targets in Glioma With Molecular Imaging.
Abstract: Gliomas, particularly high-grade gliomas including glioblastoma (GBM), represent the most common and malignant types of primary brain cancer in adults, and carry a poor prognosis. GBM has been classified into distinct subgroups over the years based on cellular morphology, clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and neuroimaging findings. Based on these classifications, differences in therapeutic response and patient outcomes have been established. Recently, the identification of complex molecular signatures of GBM has led to the development of diverse targeted therapeutic regimens and translation into multiple clinical trials. Chemical-, peptide-, antibody-, and nanoparticle-based probes have been designed to target specific molecules in gliomas and then be visualized with multimodality molecular imaging (MI) techniques including positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF), bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus, multiple molecules of interest can now be noninvasively imaged to guide targeted therapies with a potential survival benefit. Here, we review developments in molecular-targeted diagnosis and therapy in glioma, MI of these targets, and MI monitoring of treatment response, with a focus on the biological mechanisms of these advanced molecular probes. MI probes have the potential to noninvasively demonstrate the pathophysiologic features of glioma for diagnostic, treatment, and response assessment considerations for various targeted therapies, including immunotherapy. However, most MI tracers are in preclinical development, with only integrin alpha(V)beta(3) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant MI tracers having been translated to patients. Expanded international collaborations would accelerate translational research in the field of glioma MI.

Title: MGMT Promoter Methylation and IDH1 Mutations Do Not Affect [(18)F]FDOPA Uptake in Primary Brain Tumors.
Abstract: The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of methylation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMTp) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH 1) mutations on amino acid metabolism evaluated with 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([(18)F] FDOPA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Seventy-two patients with primary brain tumors were enrolled in the study (33 women and 39 men; mean age 44 +/- 12 years old). All of them were subjected to PET/CT examination after surgical treatment. Of them, 29 (40.3%) were affected by grade II glioma and 43 (59.7%) by grade III. PET/CT was scored as positive or negative and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) was calculated as the ratio between SUVmax of the lesion vs that of the background. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Methylation of MGMTp was detectable in 61 out of the 72 patients examinated. Mean SUVr in patients without methylation of MGMTp was 1.44 +/- 0,38 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.48 of patients with methylation (p = 0.15). Data on IDH1 mutations were available for 43 subjects; of them, 31 are IDH-mutant. Mean SUVr was 1.38 +/- 0.51 in patients IDH mutant and 1.46 +/- 0.56 in patients IDH wild type. MGMTp methylation and IDH1 mutations do not affect [(18)F] FDOPA uptake in primary brain tumors and therefore cannot be assessed or predicted by radiopharmaceutical uptake parameters.

Title: Dual PET Imaging of an H3K27M-Mutant Glioma With 18F-GE-180 and 18F-FET PET.
Abstract: A 25-year-old man presented with headache and intracranial pressure symptoms. On MRI, an intracranial lesion was detected in the right thalamus with exophytic growth into the third ventricle and inhomogeneous contrast enhancement without necrosis. Dual amino acid (F-FET) and TSPO (F-GE-180) PET imaging showed high tumor-to-background ratios in both scans and a short time-to-peak in F-FET uptake dynamics. Biopsy revealed a diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-mutant (WHO grade IV), a novel entity in the 2016 WHO classification with poor clinical outcome. Our case shows that the highly aggressive features of this tumor entity can be visualized in vivo by both PET modalities.

Title: Reactor produced [(64)Cu]CuCl(2) as a PET radiopharmaceutical for cancer imaging: from radiochemistry laboratory to nuclear medicine clinic.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Copper-64 is a useful theranostic radioisotope that is attracting renewed interest from the nuclear medicine community in the recent times. This study aims to demonstrate the utility of research reactors to produce clinical-grade (64)Cu via (63)Cu(n,gamma)(64)Cu reaction and use it in the form of [(64)Cu]CuCl(2) as a radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of cancer in human patients. METHODS: Copper-64 was produced by irradiation of natural CuO target in a medium flux research reactor. The irradiated target was radiochemically processed and detailed quality control analyses were carried out. Sub-acute toxicity studies were carried out with different doses of Cu in Wistar rats. The biological efficacy of the radiopharmaceutical was established in preclinical setting by biodistribution studies in melanoma tumor bearing mice. After getting regulatory approvals, [(64)Cu]CuCl(2) formulation was clinically used for PET imaging of prostate cancer and glioblastoma patients. RESULTS: Large-scale (~ 30 GBq) production of (64)Cu could be achieved in a typical batch and it was adequate for formulation of clinical doses for multiple patients. The radiopharmaceutical met all the purity requirements for administration in human subjects. Studies carried out in animal model showed that the toxicity due to "cold" Cu in clinical dose of [(64)Cu]CuCl(2) for PET scans would be negligible. Clinical PET scans showed satisfactory uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the primary cancer and its metastatic sites. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on use of reactor produced [(64)Cu]CuCl(2) for PET imaging of cancer in human patients. It is envisaged that this route of production of (64)Cu would aid towards affordable availability of this radioisotope for widespread clinical use in countries with limited cyclotron facilities.

Title: The One Health Consortium: Design of a Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate M032, a Genetically Engineered HSV-1 Expressing IL-12, in Combination With a Checkpoint Inhibitor in Canine Patients With Sporadic High Grade Gliomas.
Abstract: As the most common and deadly of primary brain tumors, malignant gliomas have earned their place within one of the most multifaceted and heavily-funded realms of medical research. Numerous avenues of pre-clinical investigation continue to provide valuable insight, but modeling the complex evolution and behavior of these tumors within a host under simulated circumstances may pose challenges to extrapolation of data. Remarkably, certain breeds of pet dogs spontaneously and sporadically develop high grade gliomas that follow similar incidence, treatment, and outcome patterns as their human glioma counterparts. The most malignant of these tumors have been refractory to limited treatment options despite aggressive treatment; outcomes are dismal with median survivals of just over 1 year in humans and 2 months in dogs. Novel treatments are greatly needed and combination therapies appear to hold promise. This clinical protocol, a dose-escalating phase I study in dogs with sporadic malignant glioma, represents a first in comparative oncology and combination immunotherapy. The trial will evaluate M032, an Interleukin-12 expressing Herpes Simplex virus, alone and combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, Indoximod. Extensive pre-clinical work has demonstrated safety of intracranial M032 administration in mice and non-human primates. M032 is currently being tested in humans with high-grade malignant gliomas. Thus, in a novel fashion, both canine and human trials will proceed concurrently allowing a direct "head-to-head" comparison of safety and efficacy. We expect this viral oncolytic therapy to be as safe as it is in human patients and M032 to (a) infect and kill glioma cells, producing a virus and tumor cell antigen-rich debris field; (b) provide an adjuvant effect due to liberation of viral DNA, which is rich in unmethylated CpG sequences that "toggle" TLR-9 receptors; and (c) express IL-12 locally, stimulating induction of TH1 lymphocytes. The resultant immune-mediated anti-viral responses should, through cross-epitope spreading, translate into a strong response to tumor antigens. The ability to compare human and dog responses in real time affords the most stringent test of suitability of the dog as an informative model of human brain tumors. Subsequent studies will allow canine trials to properly inform the design of human trials.

Title: Repeat convection-enhanced delivery for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: While the safety and efficacy of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) have been studied in patients receiving single-dose drug infusions, agents for oncological therapy may require repeated or chronic infusions to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. Repeat and chronic CED infusions have rarely been described for oncological purposes. Currently available CED devices are not approved for extended indwelling use, and the only potential at this time is for sequential treatments through multiple procedures. The authors report on the safety and experience in a group of pediatric patients who received sequential CED into the brainstem for the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS: Patients in this study were enrolled in a phase I single-center clinical trial using 124I-8H9 monoclonal antibody (124I-omburtamab) administered by CED (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01502917). A retrospective chart and imaging review were used to assess demographic data, CED infusion data, and postoperative neurological and surgical outcomes. MRI scans were analyzed using iPlan Flow software for volumetric measurements. Target and catheter coordinates as well as radial, depth, and absolute error in MRI space were calculated with the ClearPoint imaging software. RESULTS: Seven patients underwent 2 or more sequential CED infusions. No patients experienced Clinical Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater deficits. One patient had a persistent grade 2 cranial nerve deficit after a second infusion. No patient experienced hemorrhage or stroke postoperatively. There was a statistically significant decrease in radial error (p = 0.005) and absolute tip error (p = 0.008) for the second infusion compared with the initial infusion. Sequential infusions did not result in significantly different distribution capacities between the first and second infusions (volume of distribution determined by the PET signal/volume of infusion ratio [mean +/- SD]: 2.66 +/- 0.35 vs 2.42 +/- 0.75; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates the ability to safely perform sequential CED infusions into the pediatric brainstem. Past treatments did not negatively influence the procedural workflow, technical application of the targeting interface, or distribution capacity. This limited experience provides a foundation for using repeat CED for oncological purposes.

Title: Multiparametric MR-PET measurements in hypermetabolic regions reflect differences in molecular status and tumor grade in treatment-naive diffuse gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess whether hypermetabolically-defined regions of interest (ROIs) on 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) could be used to evaluate physiological features and whether there are measurable differences between molecular subtypes and tumor grades. METHODS: Sixty-eight treatment-naive glioma patients who underwent FDOPA PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively included. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense regions (FLAIR(ROI)) were segmented. FDOPA hypermetabolic regions (FDOPA(ROI), tumor-to-striatum ratios > 1) within FLAIR(ROI) were extracted. Normalized maximum standardized uptake value (nSUV(max)), volume of each ROI, and median relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) within FLAIR(ROI) or FDOPA(ROI) were calculated. Imaging metrics were compared using Students t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to determine whether imaging metrics within FLAIR(ROI) or FDOPA(ROI) can discriminate different molecular statuses or grades. RESULTS: Using either FLAIR(ROI) or FDOPA(ROI), the nSUV(max) and rCBV were significantly higher and the ADC was lower in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type than mutant gliomas, and in higher-grade gliomas (HGGs) than lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). The FDOPA(ROI) volume was significantly higher in 1p19q codeleted than non-codeleted gliomas, and in HGGs than LGGs. Although not significant, imaging metrics extracted by FDOPA(ROI) discriminated molecular status and tumor grade more accurately than those extracted by FLAIR(ROI) (AUC of IDH status, 0.87 vs. 0.82; 1p19q status, 0.78 vs. 0.73; grade, 0.87 vs. 0.76). CONCLUSION: FDOPA hypermetabolic ROI may extract useful imaging features of gliomas, which can illuminate biological differences between different molecular status or tumor grades.

Title: Can FDG-PET/MR help to overcome limitations of sequential MRI and PET-FDG for differential diagnosis between recurrence/progression and radionecrosis of high-grade gliomas?
Abstract: The aim of our study was assessing the potential of FDG-PET-MRI to overcome limitations of separately performed MRI and PET-FDG and improving the performance of high-grade gliomas evaluation. Combined PET-MRI analysis allowed differentiating between recurrence/progression and radionecrosis with improved diagnostic accuracy (95% vs 63% for PET and 82% for MRI). FDG being a reliable, cost-saving tracer in this indication, combined FDG PET-MRI analysis could play a significant role in the follow-up of high-grade brain tumors.

Title: PET, image-guided HDAC inhibition of pediatric diffuse midline glioma improves survival in murine models.
Abstract: Efforts at altering the dismal prognosis of pediatric midline gliomas focus on direct delivery strategies like convection-enhanced delivery (CED), where a cannula is implanted into tumor. Successful CED treatments require confirmation of tumor coverage, dosimetry, and longitudinal in vivo pharmacokinetic monitoring. These properties would be best determined clinically with image-guided dosimetry using theranostic agents. In this study, we combine CED with novel, molecular-grade positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and show how PETobinostat, a novel PET-imageable HDAC inhibitor, is effective against DIPG models. PET data reveal that CED has significant mouse-to-mouse variability; imaging is used to modulate CED infusions to maximize tumor saturation. The use of PET-guided CED results in survival prolongation in mouse models; imaging shows the need of CED to achieve high brain concentrations. This work demonstrates how personalized image-guided drug delivery may be useful in potentiating CED-based treatment algorithms and supports a foundation for clinical translation of PETobinostat.

Title: BRAF V600E mutation mediates FDG-methionine uptake mismatch in polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young.
Abstract: We present a case of a 14-year old boy with tumor-associated refractory epilepsy. Positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated a region with heterogeneous high (11)C-methionine uptake and a region with homogenous low (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake within the tumor. Histopathological and genomic analyses confirmed the tumor as BRAF V600E-mutated polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY). Within the high-methionine-uptake region, we observed increased protein levels of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), a major transporter of methionine; c-Myc; and constituents of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We also found that LAT1 expression was linked to the BRAF V600E mutation and subsequent activation of MAPK signaling and c-Myc. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the MAPK pathway suppressed c-Myc and LAT1 expression in BRAF V600E-mutated PLNTY and glioblastoma cells. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib moderately suppressed cell viability in PLNTY. Collectively, our results indicate that BRAF V600E mutation-activated MAPK signaling and downstream c-Myc induces specific metabolic alterations in PLNTY, and may represent an attractive target in the treatment of the disease.

Title: Photopenic Defects in Gliomas With Amino-Acid PET and Relative Prognostic Value: A Multicentric 11C-Methionine and 18F-FDOPA PET Experience.
Abstract: The aim is to explore the concept of photopenic defects in newly diagnosed glioma patients with the 2 widely used C-MET and F-FDOPA PET amino acid tracers. Thirty-two C-MET and 26 F-FDOPA PET scans with amino acid PET-negative gliomas were selected in this European multicentric study. Of these gliomas, 16 C-MET and 10 F-FDOPA PET scans with photopenic defects were identified, exhibiting lower mean tumor-to-background ratio as compared with isometabolic gliomas (P < 0.001). Gliomas with photopenic defects had no different progression-free survival than isometabolic gliomas in the whole population (P = 0.40), but shorter progression-free survival in the subgroup of World Health Organization grade II IDH-mutant astrocytomas (35 vs 68 months; P = 0.047).

Title: Glucose Loading Enhances the Value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the Characterization and Delineation of Cerebral Gliomas.
Abstract: This study aimed to assess how to enhance the value of (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CTs for glioma grading and better delineation of the tumor boundary by glucose loading. In mouse models of brain tumor using U87MG cells, (18)F-FDG-PET images were obtained after fasting and after glucose loading. There was a significant difference in the tumor-to-normal cortex-uptake ratio (TNR) between the fasting and glucose-loading scans. (14)C-2-Deoxy-D-glucose ((14)C-DG) uptake was measured in vitro using U87MG, U373MG and primary neurons cultured with different concentrations of glucose. The tumor-to-neuron ratio of (14)C-DG uptake increased with up to 10 mM of glucose. Finally, 10 low-grade and 17 high-grade glioma patients underwent fasting and glucose loading (18)F-FDG PET/CT and the TNR was compared between scans. The effect of glucose loading was significant in high-grade but not in low-grade gliomas. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with a cut-off TNR of 0.81 showed a higher area under the curve after glucose loading than fasting for differentiating low-grade versus high-grade gliomas. In addition, the glucose loading PET/CT was more useful than the fasting PET/CT for the discrimination of oligodendrogliomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Glucose loading resulted in a greater reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake in the normal cortex than in tumors, which increases the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for grading.

Title: Human IDH mutant 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas have low tumor acidity as evidenced by molecular MRI and PET: a retrospective study.
Abstract: Co-deletion of 1p/19q is a hallmark of oligodendroglioma and predicts better survival. However, little is understood about its metabolic characteristics. In this study, we aimed to explore the extracellular acidity of WHO grade II and III gliomas associated with 1p/19q co-deletion. We included 76 glioma patients who received amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging at 3 T. Magnetic transfer ratio asymmetry (MTR(asym)) at 3.0 ppm was used as the pH-sensitive CEST biomarker, with higher MTR(asym) indicating lower pH. To control for the confounder factors, T(2) relaxometry and L-6-(18)F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalnine ((18)F-FDOPA) PET data were collected in a subset of patients. We found a significantly lower MTR(asym) in 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas (co-deleted, 1.17% +/- 0.32%; non-co-deleted, 1.72% +/- 0.41%, P = 1.13 x 10(-7)), while FDOPA (P = 0.92) and T(2) (P = 0.61) were not significantly affected. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that MTR(asym) could discriminate co-deletion status with an area under the curve of 0.85. In analysis of covariance, 1p/19q co-deletion status was the only significant contributor to the variability in MTR(asym) when controlling for age and FDOPA (P = 2.91 x 10(-3)) or T(2) (P = 8.03 x 10(-6)). In conclusion, 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas were less acidic, which may be related to better prognosis. Amine CEST-MRI may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for identifying 1p/19q co-deletion status.

Title: Boron neutron capture therapy for malignant brain tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is tumor-selective particle radiation therapy that depends on the nuclear capture and fission reactions. These reactions occur when a non-radioactive boron isotope ((10)B) is irradiated with low-energy thermal neutrons to yield high linear energy transfer alpha-particles and lithium-7 nuclei within a limited path length, i.e., an almost one-cell diameter. The (10)B-containing cells can then be selectively destroyed by these potent particles. BNCT has been applied in the field of malignant brain tumors for newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas (chiefly glioblastomas). CLINICAL RESULTS: These clinical applications of BNCT have been performed with reactor-based neutron sources over the past decades. We also applied reactor-based BNCT for 58 newly diagnosed glioblastomas and 68 recurrent malignant gliomas including 52 glioblastomas. In this review article, we summarize the clinical results from the literature concerning BNCT for these high-grade gliomas (including our research). We also applied reactor-based BNCT for 46 cases of recurrent and refractory high-grade meningiomas, and some of the results will be presented herein. FUTURE PROSPECTS: In Japan, neutron sources have been shifted from reactors to accelerators. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have been performed for recurrent malignant gliomas using accelerator-based neutron sources, and now fortunately, a cyclotron-based neutron generator has been approved as a medical device by Japanese regulatory authority, as the world's first accelerator-based BNCT system for medical use. We also discuss the future prospects of accelerator-based BNCT in hospitals as therapy for malignant brain tumors.

Title: MR-guided focused ultrasound increases antibody delivery to nonenhancing high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-grade glioma (HGG) remains a recalcitrant clinical problem despite many decades of research. A major challenge in improving prognosis is the inability of current therapeutic strategies to address a clinically significant burden of infiltrating tumor cells that extend beyond the margins of the primary tumor mass. Such cells cannot be surgically excised nor efficiently targeted by radiation therapy. Therapeutic targeting of this tumor cell population is significantly hampered by the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we performed a preclinical investigation of the efficiency of MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (FUS) to temporarily disrupt the BBB to allow selective delivery of a tumor-targeting antibody to infiltrating tumor. METHODS: Structural MRI, dynamic-contrast enhancement MRI, and histology were used to fully characterize the MR-enhancing properties of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) orthotopic mouse model of HGG and to develop a reproducible, robust model of nonenhancing HGG. PET-CT imaging techniques were then used to evaluate the efficacy of FUS to increase (89)Zr-radiolabeled antibody concentration in nonenhancing HGG regions and adjacent non-targeted tumor tissue. RESULTS: The PDX mouse model of HGG has a significant tumor burden lying behind an intact BBB. Increased antibody uptake in nonenhancing tumor regions is directly proportional to the FUS-targeted volume. FUS locally increased antibody uptake in FUS-targeted regions of the tumor with an intact BBB, while leaving untargeted regions unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: FUS exposure successfully allowed temporary BBB disruption, localized to specifically targeted, nonenhancing, infiltrating tumor regions and delivery of a systemically administered antibody was significantly increased.

Title: Prediction of MGMT Status for Glioblastoma Patients Using Radiomics Feature Extraction From (18)F-DOPA-PET Imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is associated with improved treatment response and survival in patients with glioblastoma (GB), but the necessary pathologic specimen can be nondiagnostic. In this study, we assessed whether radiomics features from pretreatment (18)F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could be used to predict pathologic MGMT status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 86 patients with newly diagnosed GB, split into 3 groups (training, validating, and predicting). We performed a radiomics analysis on (18)F-DOPA PET images by extracting features from 2 tumor-based contours: a "Gold" contour of all abnormal uptake per expert nuclear medicine physician and a high-grade glioma (HGG) contour based on a tumor-to-normal hemispheric ratio >2.0, representing the most aggressive components. Feature selection was performed by comparing the weighted feature importance and filtering with bivariate analysis. Optimization of model parameters was explored using grid search with selected features. The stability of the model with increasing input features was also investigated for model robustness. The model predictions were then applied by comparing the overall survival probability of the patients with GB and unknown MGMT status versus those with known MGMT status. RESULTS: A radiomics signature was constructed to predict MGMT methylation status. Using features extracted from HGG contour alone with a random forest model, we achieved 80% +/- 10% accuracy for 95% confidence level in predicting MGMT status. The prediction accuracy was not improved with the addition of the Gold contour or with more input features. The model was applied to the patients with unknown MGMT methylation status. The prediction results are consistent with what is expected using overall survival as a surrogate. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 3 features from radiomics modeling of (18)F-DOPA PET imaging can predict MGMT methylation status with reasonable accuracy. These results could provide valuable therapeutic guidance for patients in whom MGMT testing is inconclusive or nondiagnostic.

Title: Pediatric Diffuse Midline Gliomas H3 K27M-Mutant and Non-Histone Mutant Midline High-Grade Gliomas in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 in Comparison With Non-Syndromic Children: A Single-Center Pilot Study.
Abstract: Background: Pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients rarely develop aggressive central nervous system tumors. Among high-grade gliomas (HGGs), histone mutant diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs H3 K27M-mutant) have exceptionally been reported. The aim of this retrospectives single-center study was to compare the clinical behavior of DMGs H3 K27M-mutant and non-histone mutant midline HGGs in NF1 vs. non-syndromic children and to report imaging features of NF1 HGGs. Method: We conducted a retrospective review of cerebral DMGs H3 K27M-mutant or non-histone mutant HGGs in 18 patients with or without NF1 followed at our institution between 2010 and 2018. Differences in outcomes, notably progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), were evaluated. Results: Two patients were identified with genetically confirmed diagnosis of NF1 and cerebral HGGs (one DMG H3 K27M-mutant and one histone wild type). Both subjects presented with midline mass lesions with imaging features of aggressive biological activity on advanced MRI or amino-acid PET. During the same time period, 16 non-NF1 patients (11 subjects with DMGs H3 K27M-mutant and 5 with non-histone mutant midline HGGs) were treated at our institution. The two patients with NF1 and HGGs presented a PFS of 3 months and an OS of 5 and 7 months. Median PFS and OS of children without NF1 were respectively 6 and 10 months in DMGs H3 K27M-mutant, and 6 and 11 months in H3 K27M wild-type tumors. Seventy-five percent of subjects with non-NF1 HGGs presented a PFS >4 months compared to 0% in NF1 patients. The 8-month OS of patients with non-NF1 HGGs was 81% compared to 0% in NF1 patients. Conclusions: Cerebral HGGs arising in midline structures rarely occur in pediatric patients with NF1 and present with extremely poor prognosis, worse than HGGs developing in non-NF1 patients, independent of the presence or absence of H3 K27M mutation. Imaging features of aggressive biological activity on advanced MRI or amino-acid PET imaging suggest prompt neuropathological and molecular investigations.

Title: Radiotherapy target volume definition in newly diagnosed high grade glioma using (18)F-FET PET imaging and multiparametric perfusion MRI: A prospective study (IMAGG).
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate tumor volume delineation by amino acid PET and multiparametric perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated high grade glioma (HGG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with histologically confirmed HGG underwent O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET), conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as contrast-enhanced (CE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and multiparametric MRI as relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and permeability estimation map (K2). Areas of MRI volumes were semi-automatically segmented. The percentage overlap volumes, Dice and Jaccard spatial similarity coefficients (OV, DSC, JSC) were calculated. RESULTS: The (18)F-FET tumor volume was significantly larger than the CE volume (median 43.5 mL (2.5-124.9) vs. 23.8 mL (1.4-80.3), p = 0.005). The OV between (18)F-FET uptake and CE volume was low (median OV 0.59 (0.10-1)), as well as spatial similarity (median DSC 0.52 (0.07-0.78); median JSC 0.35 (0.03-0.64)). Twenty-five patients demonstrated both rCBV and CE on MRI: The median rCBV tumor volume was significantly smaller than the median CE volume (p < 0.001). The OV was high (median 0.83 (0.54-1)), but the spatial similarity was low (median DSC 0.45 (0.04-0.83); median JSC 0.29 (0.07-0.71)). Twenty-eight patients demonstrated both K2 and CE on MRI. The median K2 tumor volume was not significantly larger than the median CE volume. The OV was high (median OV 0.90 (0.61-1)), and the spatial similarity was moderate (median DSC 0.75 (0.01-0.83); median JSC 0.60 (0.11-0.89)). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that multiparametric perfusion MRI volumes (rCBV, K2) were highly correlated with CE T1 gadolinium volumes whereas (18)F-FET PET provided complementary information, suggesting that the metabolically active tumor volume in patients with newly diagnosed untreated HGG is critically underestimated by contrast enhanced MRI. (18)F-FET PET imaging may help to improve target volume delineation accuracy for radiotherapy planning.

Title: Role of the default mode resting-state network for cognitive functioning in malignant glioma patients following multimodal treatment.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Progressive cognitive decline following multimodal neurooncological treatment is a common observation in patients suffering from malignant glioma. Alterations of the default-mode network (DMN) represent a possible source of impaired neurocognitive functioning and were analyzed in these patients. METHODS: Eighty patients (median age, 51 years) with glioma (WHO grade IV glioblastoma, n = 57; WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, n = 13; WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma, n = 10) and ECOG performance score 0-1 underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological testing at a median interval of 13 months (range, 1-114 months) after initiation of therapy. For evaluation of structural and metabolic changes after treatment, anatomical MRI and amino acid PET using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) were simultaneously acquired to rs-fMRI on a hybrid MR/PET scanner. A cohort of 80 healthy subjects matched for gender, age, and educational status served as controls. RESULTS: The connectivity pattern within the DMN (12 nodes) of the glioma patients differed significantly from that of the healthy subjects but did not depend on age, tumor grade, time since treatment initiation, presence of residual/recurrent tumor, number of chemotherapy cycles received, or anticonvulsive medication. Small changes in the connectivity pattern were observed in patients who had more than one series of radiotherapy. In contrast, structural tissue changes located at or near the tumor site (including resection cavities, white matter lesions, edema, and tumor tissue) had a strong negative impact on the functional connectivity of the adjacent DMN nodes, resulting in a marked dependence of the connectivity pattern on tumor location. In the majority of neurocognitive domains, glioma patients performed significantly worse than healthy subjects. Correlation analysis revealed that reduced connectivity in the left temporal and parietal DMN nodes was associated with low performance in language processing and verbal working memory. Furthermore, connectivity of the left parietal DMN node also correlated with processing speed, executive function, and verbal as well as visual working memory. Overall DMN connectivity loss and cognitive decline were less pronounced in patients with higher education. CONCLUSION: Personalized treatment strategies for malignant glioma patients should consider the left parietal and temporal DMN nodes as vulnerable regions concerning neurocognitive outcome.

Title: Applications of radiomics and machine learning for radiotherapy of malignant brain tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amino acid positron-emission tomography (PET) of the brain contain a vast amount of structural and functional information that can be analyzed by machine learning algorithms and radiomics for the use of radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. METHODS: This study is based on comprehensive literature research on machine learning and radiomics analyses in neuroimaging and their potential application for radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma or brain metastases. RESULTS: Feature-based radiomics and deep learning-based machine learning methods can be used to improve brain tumor diagnostics and automate various steps of radiotherapy planning. In glioma patients, important applications are the determination of WHO grade and molecular markers for integrated diagnosis in patients not eligible for biopsy or resection, automatic image segmentation for target volume planning, prediction of the location of tumor recurrence, and differentiation of pseudoprogression from actual tumor progression. In patients with brain metastases, radiomics is applied for additional detection of smaller brain metastases, accurate segmentation of multiple larger metastases, prediction of local response after radiosurgery, and differentiation of radiation injury from local brain metastasis relapse. Importantly, high diagnostic accuracies of 80-90% can be achieved by most approaches, despite a large variety in terms of applied imaging techniques and computational methods. CONCLUSION: Clinical application of automated image analyses based on radiomics and artificial intelligence has a great potential for improving radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. However, a common problem associated with these techniques is the large variability and the lack of standardization of the methods applied.

Title: Diagnostic value of PET/CT with (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) in newly diagnosed glioma based on the 2016 WHO classification.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The molecular features of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and chromosome 1p and 19q (1p/19q) codeletion status have pivotal role for differentiating gliomas and have been integrated in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification in 2016. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT) has been used to evaluate tumour grade and proliferative activity and compared with L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET) in glioma patients. Herein, we evaluated tracer uptakes of MET-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT for differentiating glioma based on the 2016 WHO classification especially in relation to IDH1 mutation status. METHODS: In total, 81 patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioma were enrolled in this study. They underwent PET/CT studies with MET and FLT before surgery. The molecular features and histopathological diagnosis based on the 2016 WHO classification were determined using surgical specimens. The ratios of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tumours to the mean SUV of the contralateral cortex (T/N ratios) were calculated on MET-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT images. RESULTS: The mean T/N ratios of MET-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT in IDH1-wildtype tumours were significantly higher than those in IDH1-mutant tumours (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis for differentiating IDH1 mutation status showed that the area under the curve of the FLT T/N ratio was significantly larger than that of the MET T/N ratio (P < 0.01). The mean T/N ratio of FLT-PET/CT in IDH1-wildtype tumours was significantly higher than that in IDH1-mutant tumours among grade II and III gliomas (P = 0.005), but this was not the case for MET-PET/CT. Both MET-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT were able to distinguish between grade II and III gliomas in IDH1-mutant tumours (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively), but only FLT-PET/CT was able to distinguish between grade III and IV gliomas in IDH1-wildtype tumours (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: This study showed that FLT-PET/CT can be used to determine the IDH1 mutation status and evaluate glioma grade more accurately than MET-PET/CT. FLT-PET/CT can improve glioma differentiation based on the 2016 WHO classification, but caution must be paid for tumours without contrast enhancement and further studies should be conducted with more cases.

Title: The role of 11C-methionine PET in patients with negative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: correlation with histology and molecular biomarkers in operated gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare 11C-methionine (11C-METH) PET with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in patients with glioma candidate to neurosurgery. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data from 124 consecutive patients (n = 124) investigated during preoperative work-up. Both visual and semiquantitative parameters were utilized for image analysis. The reference standard was based on histopathology. The median follow-up was 14.3 months. RESULTS: Overall, 47 high-grade gliomas (HGG) and 77 low-grade gliomas (LGG) were diagnosed. On visual assessment, sensitivity and specificity for differentiating HGG from LGG were 80.8 and 59.7% for DWI-MRI, versus 95.7 and 41.5% for 11C-METH PET, respectively. On semiquantitative analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 78.7, 71.4, and 80.4% for SUVmax, 78.7, 70.1, and 81.1% for SUVratio, and 74.5, 61, and 76.7% for MTB (metabolic tumor burden), respectively. In patients with negative DWI-MRI and IDH-wild type, SUVmax and SUVratio were higher compared to IDH-mutated (P = 0.025 and P = 0.01, respectively). In LGG, patients with 1p/19q codeletion showed higher SUVmax (P = 0.044). In all patients with negative DWI-MRI, median PFS was longer for SUVmax <3.9 (median not reached vs 34.2 months, P = 0.004), SUVratio <2.3 (median not reached vs 21.5 months, P < 0.001), and MTB <3.1 (median not reached vs 45.7 months, P = 0.05). In LGG patients with negative DWI-MRI, only SUVratio <2.3 and MTB <3.1 were associated with longer PFS (P = 0.016 and P = 0.024, respectively). CONCLUSION: C-METH PET was found highly sensitive for glioma differentiation and molecular characterization. In DWI-negative patients, PET parameters correlated with molecular profile were associated with clinical outcome.

Title: FuMeGA Criteria for Visual Assessment of Postoperative 18F-Fluorocholine PET in Patients With Glioma.
Abstract: Postoperative assessment is crucial in the imaging follow-up and prognosis in patients with glioma. Whereas grade of resection is defined attending to the gadolinium enhancement in early postoperative MRI, no metabolical criteria exist for postoperative PET interpretation. Based on our prospective and multicenter FuMeGA (Functional and Metabolic Glioma Analysis) ongoing study, we propose criteria for the visual interpretation of F-fluorocholine PET scans in patients undergoing brain tumor resection. The different imaging characteristics between MRI and PET may explain the discordances regarding to the postresection status with both techniques.

Title: Hypoxia and Amino Acid Imaging of High-Grade Glioma: 18F-FAZA PET/CT and 11C-Methionine PET/MRI.
Abstract: In the present case, we report the first experience of a patient with high-grade glioma who underwent dual F-FAZA PET/CT imaging for intratumoral hypoxia assessment, before treatment, and for therapy monitoring in the suspicious of recurrence, as part of a clinical research protocol. In addition, despite the diagnosis of glioblastoma, the patient at 3 years from diagnosis was alive and underwent C-methionine simultaneous PET/MRI for disease monitoring after treatment, showing stability of disease. The multitracer capability of PET in assessing different and complementary metabolic features along with the use of a last-generation scanner as PET/MRI in brain oncology are here enlighten.

Title: The use of multiparametric 18F-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine PET/MRI in post-therapy assessment of patients with gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the utility of F-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (F-DOPA) PET/MRI versus cross-sectional MRI alone in glioma response assessment and identify whether the two techniques demonstrate different tumour features. METHODS: F-DOPA PET/MRI studies from 40 patients were analysed. Quantitative PET parameters and conventional MRI features were recorded. Tumour volume was assessed on both PET and MRI. Using dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging, maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were obtained. Within volume of tumours of tumour features and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) drawn on MRI, standardised uptake value (SUV)max, CBF and CBV were recorded. Presence of residual active tumour was assessed by qualitative visual assessment. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed univariately and on parameter combination to analyse ability to determine presence/absence of disease. Reference standard for presence of viable tissue was biopsy or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Median SUVmax was 3.4 for low-grade glioma (LGG) and 3.3 for high-grade glioma (HGG). There was a significant correlation between PWI parameters and WHO grade (P < 0.001), but no correlation with SUVmax. Median F-DOPA volume was 8216.88 mm for HGG and 6284.94 mm for LGG; MRI volume was 6316.57 mm and 5931.55 mm, respectively. SUVmax analysis distinguished enhancing and nonenhancing components from necrosis and NAWM and demonstrated active disease in nonenhancing regions. Visually, the modalities were concordant in 37 patients. Combining the multiparametric PET/MRI approach with all available data-enhanced detection of the presence of tumour (area under the curve 0.99, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MRI and F-DOPA are complementary modalities for assessment of tumour burden. Matching F-DOPA and MRI in assessing residual tumour volume may better delineate the radiotherapy target volume.

Title: Multiparametric MR-PET Imaging Predicts Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Response to GDC-0084 in Patients with Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: GDC-0084 is an oral, brain-penetrant small-molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR. Because these two targets alter tumor vascularity and metabolism, respectively, we hypothesized multiparametric MR-PET could be used to quantify the response, estimate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multiparametric advanced MR-PET imaging was performed to evaluate physiologic response in a first-in-man, multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of GDC-0084 (NCT01547546) in 47 patients with recurrent malignant glioma. RESULTS: Measured maximum concentration (C (max)) was associated with a decrease in enhancing tumor volume (P = 0.0287) and an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA; P = 0.0418). Posttreatment tumor volume, (18)F-FDG uptake, K(trans), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were all correlated with C (max). A linear combination of change in (18)F-FDG PET uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, K(trans), v(p), and rCBV was able to estimate both C (max) (R(2) = 0.4113; P < 0.0001) and drug exposure (AUC; R(2) = 0.3481; P < 0.0001). Using this composite multiparametric MR-PET imaging response biomarker to predict PK, patients with an estimated C (max) > 0.1 mumol/L and AUC > 1.25 mumol/L*hour demonstrated significantly longer PFS compared with patients with a lower estimated concentration and exposure (P = 0.0039 and P = 0.0296, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest composite biomarkers created from multiparametric MR-PET imaging targeting metabolic and/or physiologic processes specific to the drug mechanism of action may be useful for subsequent evaluation of treatment efficacy for larger phase II-III studies.

Title: Low-Grade Versus High-Grade Glioma... That Is the Question. 18F-Fluorocholine PET in the Detection of Anaplastic Focus.
Abstract: Gliomas are characterized by intratumoral histological heterogeneity, coexisting foci of low and high grade. First, in low-grade gliomas, neoangiogenesis has not yet developed and cellularity is low, so alterations on perfusion MRI may not be present. Second, a non-negligible number of high-grade gliomas show none, patchy, or weak contrast enhancement on MRI, so they can be misdiagnosed as low-grade glioma, preventing their correct management. We present 4 cases of patients in which F-fluorocholine PET defined the anaplastic tumor component and therefore the tumor aggressiveness, solving the limitations of MRI.

Title: Imaging of intratumoral heterogeneity in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: High-grade glioma (HGG), and particularly Glioblastoma (GBM), can exhibit pronounced intratumoral heterogeneity that confounds clinical diagnosis and management. While conventional contrast-enhanced MRI lacks the capability to resolve this heterogeneity, advanced MRI techniques and PET imaging offer a spectrum of physiologic and biophysical image features to improve the specificity of imaging diagnoses. Published studies have shown how integrating these advanced techniques can help better define histologically distinct targets for surgical and radiation treatment planning, and help evaluate the regional heterogeneity of tumor recurrence and response assessment following standard adjuvant therapy. Application of texture analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms has also enabled the emerging field of radiogenomics, which can spatially resolve the regional and genetically distinct subpopulations that coexist within a single GBM tumor. This review focuses on the latest advances in neuro-oncologic imaging and their clinical applications for the assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity.

Title: 18F-FAZA PET imaging in tumor hypoxia: A focus on high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The presence of hypoxia is a typical feature of solid tumors and has been identified in many neoplasms, favouring the survival of malignant cells in a hostile environment and the expression of an aggressive phenotype. Malignant brain tumors have large proportions of hypoxic tissue, thus contributing to resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an attractive technique to gain a non-invasive assessment of tumor hypoxia within the whole tumor, with 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) and 18F-flouroazomycin arabinoside (18F-FAZA) being the most promising radiotracers. In this short review, we aim to discuss the available clinical studies focused on the use of 18F-FAZA PET/computed tomography in patients affected by high-grade glioma.

Title: TSPO imaging-guided characterization of the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor microenvironment in patients with malignant glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent immunosuppressors in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). Their infiltration is associated with tumor grade, progression, and therapy resistance. Specific tools for image-guided analysis of spatiotemporal changes in the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor compartments are missing. We aimed (i) to evaluate the role of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)DPA-714* (translocator protein [TSPO]) PET-MRI in the assessment of the immunosuppressive TME in glioma patients, and (ii) to cross-correlate imaging findings with in-depth immunophenotyping. METHODS: To characterize the glioma TME, a mixed collective of 9 glioma patients underwent [18F]DPA-714-PET-MRI in addition to [18F]fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET)-PET-MRI. Image-guided biopsy samples were immunophenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In vitro autoradiography was performed for image validation and assessment of tracer binding specificity. RESULTS: We found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, P = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs). TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumor-infiltrating HLA-DR+ MDSCs and TAMs. [18F]DPA-714-positive tissue volumes exceeded [18F]FET-positive volumes and showed a differential spatial distribution. CONCLUSION: [18F]DPA-714-PET may be used to non-invasively image the glioma-associated immunosuppressive TME in vivo. This imaging paradigm may also help to characterize the heterogeneity of the glioma TME with respect to the degree of myeloid cell infiltration at various disease stages. [18F]DPA-714 may also facilitate the development of new image-guided therapies targeting the myeloid-derived TME.

Title: Prediction of survival in patients with IDH-wildtype astrocytic gliomas using dynamic O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Integrated histomolecular diagnostics of gliomas according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of 2016 has refined diagnostic accuracy and prediction of prognosis. This study aimed at exploring the prognostic value of dynamic O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET in newly diagnosed, histomolecularly classified astrocytic gliomas of WHO grades III or IV. METHODS: Before initiation of treatment, dynamic FET PET imaging was performed in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Static FET PET parameters such as maximum and mean tumour/brain ratios (TBR(max/mean)), the metabolic tumour volume (MTV) as well as the dynamic FET PET parameters time-to-peak (TTP) and slope, were obtained. The predictive ability of FET PET parameters was evaluated concerning the progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS). Using ROC analyses, threshold values for FET PET parameters were obtained. Subsequently, univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses were performed to assess the predictive power of these parameters for survival. RESULTS: Sixty patients (45 GBM and 15 AA patients) of two university centres were retrospectively identified. Patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter-methylated tumours had a significantly longer PFS and OS (both P < 0.001). Furthermore, ROC analysis of IDH-wildtype glioma patients (n = 45) revealed that a TTP > 25 min (AUC, 0.90; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 87%; P < 0.001) was highly prognostic for longer PFS (13 vs. 7 months; P = 0.005) and OS (29 vs. 12 months; P < 0.001). In contrast, at a lower level of significance, TBR(max), TBR(mean), and MTV were only prognostic for longer OS (P = 0.004, P = 0.038, and P = 0.048, respectively). Besides complete resection and a methylated MGMT promoter, TTP remained significant in multivariate survival analysis (all P </= 0.02), indicating an independent predictor for OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dynamic FET PET allows the identification of patients with longer OS among patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype GBM and AA.

Title: Flare Phenomenon in O-(2-(18)F-Fluoroethyl)-l-Tyrosine PET After Resection of Gliomas.
Abstract: PET using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) is useful to detect residual tumor tissue after glioma resection. Recent animal experiments detected reactive changes in (18)F-FET uptake at the rim of the resection cavity within the first 2 wk after resection of gliomas. In the present study, we evaluated pre- and postoperative (18)F-FET PET scans of glioma patients with particular emphasis on the identification of reactive changes after surgery. Methods: Forty-three patients with cerebral gliomas (9 low-grade, 34 high-grade; 9 primary tumors, 34 recurrent tumors) who had preoperative (time before surgery: median, 23 d; range, 6-44 d) and postoperative (18)F-FET PET (time after surgery: median, 14 d; range, 5-28 d) were included. PET scans (20-40 min after injection) were evaluated visually for complete or incomplete resection and compared with MRI. Changes in (18)F-FET uptake were evaluated by tumor-to-brain ratios in residual tumor and by maximum lesion-to-brain ratios near the resection cavity. Results: Visual analysis of (18)F-FET PET scans revealed complete resection in 16 of 43 patients and incomplete resection in the remaining patients. PET results were concordant with MRI in 69% of the patients. The maximum lesion-to-brain ratio for (18)F-FET uptake near the resection cavity was significantly higher than preoperative values (1.59 +/- 0.36 vs. 1.14 +/- 0.17; n = 43; P < 0.001). In 11 patients (26%), a flare phenomenon was observed, with a considerable increase in (18)F-FET uptake compared with preoperative values in either the residual tumor (n = 5) or areas remote from the tumor on the preoperative PET scan (n = 6) (2.92 +/- 1.24 vs. 1.62 +/- 0.75; P < 0.001). Further follow-up in 5 patients showed decreasing (18)F-FET uptake in the flare areas in 4 patients and progress in 1 patient. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that (18)F-FET PET provides valuable information for assessing the success of glioma resection. Postoperative reactive changes at the rim of the resection cavity appear to be mild. However, in 23% of the patients, a postoperative flare phenomenon was observed that warrants further investigation.

Title: One-day protocol for (18)F-FDG and (13)N-ammonia PET/CT with uptake decoupling score in differentiating untreated low-grade glioma from inflammation.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Accurate identification of low-grade gliomas (LGGs; World Health Organization grades I and II) and their differentiation from brain inflammation lesions (BILs) remains difficult; however, it is essential for treatment. This study assessed whether a one-day protocol for voxel-wise (18)F-FDG and (13)N-ammonia PET/CT with uptake decoupling analysis could differentiate LGGs from BILs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with LGGs and 16 patients with BILs underwent (18)F-FDG and (13)N-ammonia PET/CT on the same day before any type of therapy. The decoupling score and tumor-to-normal tissue (T/N) ratio of (18)F-FDG and (13)N-ammonia were calculated at each location. Student's t-test was used to compare values, and ROC curve analysis was used to establish a cut-off value for the T/N ratio and decoupling score. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate differential efficacy. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in (13)N-ammonia T/N ratio (p=0.018) and decoupling score (p=0.003) between LGGs and BILs; however, the (18)F-FDG T/N ratio did not show any differences (p=0.413). Optimal cut-off values for (18)F-FDG T/N ratio, (13)N-ammonia T/N ratio, and decoupling score were 0.73, 0.97, and 2.31, respectively, with corresponding AUCs of 0.48, 0.68, and 0.77. The respective sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy parameters using these cut-off values were 53.6%, 62.5%, and 56.8%, respectively, for (18)F-FDG; 50.0%, 75.0%, and 59.1%, respectively, for (13)N-ammonia; and 60.7%, 93.8%, and 72.7%, respectively, for decoupling score. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG/(13)N-ammonia uptake decoupling score can be used to discriminate between LGGs and BILs. Use of a decoupling map of these two tracers can improve visual analysis and diagnostic accuracy.

Title: Prognostic value of 18F-FET PET/CT in newly diagnosed WHO 2016 high-grade glioma.
Abstract: O-(2-[F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (F-FET PET/CT) is well known in brain tumor management. Our study aimed to identify the prognostic value of F-FET PET/CT in high-grade gliomas (HGG) according the current 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification.Patients with histologically proven WHO 2016 HGG were prospectively included. A dynamic F-FET PET/CT was performed allowing to obtain 2 static PET frames (static frame 1: 20-40 minutes and static frame 2: 2-22 minutes). We analyzed static parameters (standard uptake value [SUV]max, SUVmean, SUVpeak, TBRmax, TBRmean, tumoral lesion glycolysis, and metabolic tumoral volume) for various isocontours (from 10% to 90%). PET parameters, clinical features, and molecular biomarkers were compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in univariate and multivariate analysis.Twenty-nine patients were included (grade III n = 3, grade IV n = 26). Mean PFS and OS were, respectively, 8.8 and 13.9 months. According to univariate analysis, SUVmean, SUVpeak, TBRmax, and TBRmean were significantly correlated with OS. In static 1 analysis, TBRmax seemed to be the best OS prognostic parameter (P = .004). In static 2 analysis, TBRmean was the best parameter (P = .01). In static 1 analysis, only SUVpeak was significant (P = .05) for PFS. Good performance status (PS < 2; P < .0001) and extent of resection (P = .019) identified the subgroup of patients with the best OS. Only TBRmax (P = .026) and extent of resection (P = .025) remained significant parameters in multivariate analysis.Our data suggested that high TBRmax seemed to be the most significant OS independent prognostic factor in patients with newly diagnosed HGG.

Title: Rate of change in maximum (18)F-FDOPA PET uptake and non-enhancing tumor volume predict malignant transformation and overall survival in low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine whether the rate of change in maximum (18)F-FDOPA PET uptake and the rate of change in non-enhancing tumor volume could predict malignant transformation and residual overall survival (OS) in low grade glioma (LGG) patients who received serial (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI scans. METHODS: 27 LGG patients with >/= 2 (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI scans between 2003 and 2016 were included. The rate of change in FLAIR volume (uL/day) and maximum normalized (18)F-FDOPA specific uptake value (nSUV(max)/month), were compared between histological and molecular subtypes. General linear models (GLMs) were used to integrate clinical information with MR-PET measurements to predict malignant transformation. Cox univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify imaging and clinical risk factors related to OS. RESULTS: A GLM using patient age, treatment, the rate of change in FLAIR and (18)F-FDOPA nSUV(max) could predict malignant transformation with > 67% sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.7556, P = 0.0248). A significant association was observed between OS and continuous rates of change in PET uptake (HR = 1.0212, P = 0.0034). Cox multivariable analysis confirmed that continuous measures of the rate of change in PET uptake was an independent predictor of OS (HR = 1.0242, P = 0.0033); however, stratification of patients based on increasing or decreasing rate of change in FLAIR (HR = 2.220, P = 0.025), PET uptake (HR = 2.148, P = 0.0311), or both FLAIR and PET (HR = 2.354, P = 0.0135) predicted OS. CONCLUSIONS: The change in maximum normalized (18)F-FDOPA PET uptake, with or without clinical information and rate of change in tumor volume, may be useful for predicting the risk of malignant transformation and estimating residual survival in patients with LGG.

Title: Role of 68Ga-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT in Disease Assessment in Glioblastoma Within 48 Hours of Surgery.
Abstract: Within 48 hours after surgery, disease assessment in glioblastoma is a challenge for both the clinician and the radiologist. Certain technical and logistical issues prevail in this period. Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT is a known molecular imaging marker in prostate cancer. Its role in high-grade gliomas has been recently discussed. We present a case of a 39-year-old man with recurrence glioblastoma of the right frontal lobe and underwent resurgery. After surgery, Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT showed residual disease along the posterior and inferior margin of the postoperative cavity.

Title: Imaging glioma biology: spatial comparison of amino acid PET, amide proton transfer, and perfusion-weighted MRI in newly diagnosed gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Imaging glioma biology holds great promise to unravel the complex nature of these tumors. Besides well-established imaging techniques such O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging, amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging has emerged as a promising novel MR technique. In this study, we aimed to better understand the relation between these imaging biomarkers and how well they capture cellularity and vascularity in newly diagnosed gliomas. METHODS: Preoperative MRI and FET-PET data of 46 patients (31 glioblastoma and 15 lower-grade glioma) were segmented into contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense areas. Using established cutoffs, we calculated hot-spot volumes (HSV) and their spatial overlap. We further investigated APTw and CBV values in FET-HSV. In a subset of 10 glioblastoma patients, we compared cellularity and vascularization in 34 stereotactically targeted biopsies with imaging. RESULTS: In glioblastomas, the largest HSV was found for APTw, followed by PET and CBV (p < 0.05). In lower-grade gliomas, APTw-HSV was clearly lower than in glioblastomas. The spatial overlap of HSV was highest between APTw and FET in both tumor entities and regions. APTw correlated significantly with cellularity, similar to FET, while the association with vascularity was more pronounced in CBV and FET. CONCLUSIONS: We found a relevant spatial overlap in glioblastomas between hotspots of APTw and FET both in contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense tumor. As suggested by earlier studies, APTw was lower in lower-grade gliomas compared with glioblastomas. APTw meaningfully contributes to biological imaging of gliomas.

Title: First-in-Human Phase I Study to Evaluate the Brain-Penetrant PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor GDC-0084 in Patients with Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: GDC-0084 is an oral, brain-penetrant small-molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR. A first-in-human, phase I study was conducted in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GDC-0084 was administered orally, once daily, to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) was performed to measure metabolic responses. RESULTS: Forty-seven heavily pretreated patients enrolled in eight cohorts (2-65 mg). Dose-limiting toxicities included 1 case of grade 2 bradycardia and grade 3 myocardial ischemia (15 mg), grade 3 stomatitis (45 mg), and 2 cases of grade 3 mucosal inflammation (65 mg); the MTD was 45 mg/day. GDC-0084 demonstrated linear and dose-proportional PK, with a half-life ( approximately 19 hours) supportive of once-daily dosing. At 45 mg/day, steady-state concentrations exceeded preclinical target concentrations producing antitumor activity in xenograft models. FDG-PET in 7 of 27 patients (26%) showed metabolic partial response. At doses >/=45 mg/day, a trend toward decreased median standardized uptake value in normal brain was observed, suggesting central nervous system penetration of drug. In two resection specimens, GDC-0084 was detected at similar levels in tumor and brain tissue, with a brain tissue/tumor-to-plasma ratio of >1 and >0.5 for total and free drug, respectively. Best overall response was stable disease in 19 patients (40%) and progressive disease in 26 patients (55%); 2 patients (4%) were nonevaluable. CONCLUSIONS: GDC-0084 demonstrated classic PI3K/mTOR-inhibitor related toxicities. FDG-PET and concentration data from brain tumor tissue suggest that GDC-0084 crossed the blood-brain barrier.

Title: Extracranial Metastases From Glioblastoma With Primitive Neuronal Components on FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: A 17-year-old girl with World Health Organization grade IV glioblastoma with primitive neuronal components (histone H3 G34-mutant and IDH1 wild type) underwent whole-body FDG PET/CT staging due to vertebral metastases on initial MRI. PET/CT revealed extracranial metastatic disease with spinal leptomeningeal dissemination, osseous metastases, and peritoneal seeding via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Glioblastoma is uncommon in pediatric patients and particularly those with primitive neuronal components. Extracranial metastases from glioblastoma are more common in those with primitive neuronal components. This case demonstrates the utility of FDG PET/CT for revealing distant metastases from glioblastoma.

Title: Prediction of lower-grade glioma molecular subtypes using deep learning.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: It is useful to know the molecular subtype of lower-grade gliomas (LGG) when deciding on a treatment strategy. This study aims to diagnose this preoperatively. METHODS: A deep learning model was developed to predict the 3-group molecular subtype using multimodal data including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT). The performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation with a dataset containing information from 217 LGG patients. RESULTS: The model performed best when the dataset contained MRI, PET, and CT data. The model could predict the molecular subtype with an accuracy of 96.6% for the training dataset and 68.7% for the test dataset. The model achieved test accuracies of 58.5%, 60.4%, and 59.4% when the dataset contained only MRI, MRI and PET, and MRI and CT data, respectively. The conventional method used to predict mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene and the codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q) sequentially had an overall accuracy of 65.9%. This is 2.8 percent point lower than the proposed method, which predicts the 3-group molecular subtype directly. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model was developed to diagnose the molecular subtype preoperatively based on multi-modality data in order to predict the 3-group classification directly. Cross-validation showed that the proposed model had an overall accuracy of 68.7% for the test dataset. This is the first model to double the expected value for a 3-group classification problem, when predicting the LGG molecular subtype.

Title: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria for Gliomas: Practical Approach Using Conventional and Advanced Techniques.
Abstract: The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were developed as an objective tool for radiologic assessment of treatment response in high-grade gliomas. Imaging plays a critical role in the management of the patient with glioma, from initial diagnosis to posttreatment follow-up, which can be particularly challenging for radiologists. Interpreting findings after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy requires profound knowledge about the tumor biology, as well as the peculiar changes expected to ensue as a consequence of each treatment technique. In this article, we discuss the imaging findings associated with tumor progression, tumor response, pseudoprogression, and pseudoresponse according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for high-grade and lower-grade gliomas. We describe relevant practical issues when evaluating patients with glioma, such as the need for imaging in the first 48 hours, the radiation therapy planning and isodose curves, the significance of T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions, the impact of the timing for the evaluation after radiation therapy, and the definition of progressive disease on the histologic specimen. We also illustrate the correlation among the findings on conventional MR imaging with advanced techniques, such as perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging, spectroscopy, and amino acid PET. Because many of the new lesions represent a mixture of tumor cells and tissue with radiation injury, the radiologist aims to identify the predominant component of the lesion and categorize the findings according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria so that the patient can receive the best treatment.

Title: Imaging and Tissue Biomarkers of Choline Metabolism in Diffuse Adult Glioma: 18F-Fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and Choline Kinase alpha.
Abstract: The cellular and molecular basis of choline uptake on PET imaging and MRS-visible choline-containing compounds is not well understood. Choline kinase alpha (ChoKalpha) is an enzyme that phosphorylates choline, an essential step in membrane synthesis. We investigate choline metabolism through 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FMC) PET, MRS, and tissue ChoKalpha in human glioma. Fourteen patients with a suspected diffuse glioma underwent multimodal 3T MRI and dynamic 18F-FMC PET/CT prior to surgery. Co-registered PET and MRI data were used to target biopsies to regions of high and low choline signal, and immunohistochemistry for ChoKalpha expression was performed. The 18F-FMC/PET differentiated WHO (World Health Organization) grade IV from grade II and III tumours, whereas MRS differentiated grade III/IV from grade II tumours. Tumoural 18F-FMC/PET uptake was higher than in normal-appearing white matter across all grades and markedly elevated within regions of contrast enhancement. The 18F-FMC/PET correlated weakly with MRS Cho ratios. ChoKalpha expression on IHC was negative or weak in all but one glioblastoma sample, and did not correlate with tumour grade or imaging choline markers. MRS and 18F-FMC/PET provide complimentary information on glioma choline metabolism. Tracer uptake is, however, potentially confounded by blood-brain barrier permeability. ChoKalpha overexpression does not appear to be a common feature in diffuse glioma.

Title: Non-invasive tumor decoding and phenotyping of cerebral gliomas utilizing multiparametric (18)F-FET PET-MRI and MR Fingerprinting.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The introduction of the 2016 WHO classification of CNS tumors has made the combined molecular and histopathological characterization of tumors a pivotal part of glioma patient management. Recent publications on radiogenomics-based prediction of the mutational status have demonstrated the predictive potential of imaging-based, non-invasive tissue characterization algorithms. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the potential of multiparametric (18)F-FET PET-MRI including MR fingerprinting accelerated with machine learning and radiomic algorithms to predict tumor grading and mutational status of patients with cerebral gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 patients with suspected primary brain tumor without prior surgical or systemic treatment or biopsy underwent an (18)F-FET PET-MRI examination. To differentiate the mutational status and the WHO grade of the cerebral tumors, support vector machine and random forest were trained with the radiomics signature of the multiparametric PET-MRI data including MR fingerprinting. Surgical sampling served as a gold standard for histopathological reference and assessment of mutational status. RESULTS: The 5-fold cross-validated area under the curve in predicting the ATRX mutation was 85.1%, MGMT mutation was 75.7%, IDH1 was 88.7%, and 1p19q was 97.8%. The area under the curve of differentiating low-grade glioma vs. high-grade glioma was 85.2%. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET PET-MRI and MR fingerprinting enable high-quality imaging-based tumor decoding and phenotyping for differentiation of low-grade vs. high-grade gliomas and for prediction of the mutational status of ATRX, IDH1, and 1p19q. These initial results underline the potential of (18)F-FET PET-MRI to serve as an alternative to invasive tissue characterization.

Title: Correlation of hypoxia as measured by fluorine-18 fluoroerythronitroimidazole ((18)F-FETNIM) PET/CT and overall survival in glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Hypoxia is important in the biology of glioma in humans. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with a hypoxia tracer offers a noninvasive method to differentiate individual tumor biology and potentially modify treatment for patients with malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypoxia, as measured by fluorine-18 fluoroerythronitroimidazole ((18)F-FETNIM) PET/CT, was associated with tumor grade, overall survival (OS), and immunohistochemical features related to hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, and the invasion of gliomas. PROCEDURES: Twenty-five patients with gliomas in whom gross maximal resection could be safely attempted were analyzed. All patients underwent (18)F-FETNIM PET/CT studies before surgery. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was obtained from the PET images of tumor tissues. Tumor specimens were stereotactically obtained for the immunohistochemical staining of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). RESULTS: A correlation between the SUVmax and glioma grade was found (r = 0.881, P < 0.001). The SUVmax was significantly correlated with the expression of HIF-1alpha, Ki-67, VEGF, and MMP-9 (r = 0.820, 0.747, 0.606, and 0.727; all P < 0.001). Patients with a high SUVmax had significantly worse 3-year OS than those with a low SUVmax (24.4% vs. 82.1%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FETNIM PET/CT provides an excellent noninvasive assessment of hypoxia in glioma. It can be used to understand the mechanisms by which hypoxia affects the OS of glioma patients.

Title: (18)F-Fluciclovine ((18)F-FACBC) PET/CT or PET/MRI in gliomas/glioblastomas.
Abstract: (18)F-fluciclovine ((18)F-FACBC) is a radiotracer already studied for prostate cancer, and its potential role in brain tumors (such as glioma) is not yet well investigated despite promising results. The aim of this review is to evaluate the possible diagnostic role of (18)F-FACBC PET/CT or PET/MRI in patients with gliomas and glioblastomas. A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane library databases was conducted to find the relevant published articles about the diagnostic performance of FACBC PET/CT or PET/MRI in patients affected by glioma and/or glioblastoma. Seven papers were included in the systematic review. From the analyses of the selected studies, the following main findings were obtained: glioma and glioblastoma are FACBC-avid tumors with a detection rate of about 100%; FACBC PET has high-diagnostic accuracy in defining tumor extent, volumes, and satellite lesions better than MR; compared to methionine, FACBC has similar accuracy but better tumor-to-background contrast; FACBC uptake may help to discriminate between low-grade and high-grade glioma. Radiolabelled fluciclovine ((18)F-FACBC) imaging seems to be useful in analyzing glioma/glioblastoma. Further studies enrolling a wider population are needed to clarify the real clinical and diagnostic role of (18)F-FACBC in this setting and its possible position in the diagnostic flowchart.

Title: Mechanism-Specific Pharmacodynamics of a Novel Complex-I Inhibitor Quantified by Imaging Reversal of Consumptive Hypoxia with [(18)F]FAZA PET In Vivo.
Abstract: Tumors lack a well-regulated vascular supply of O(2) and often fail to balance O(2) supply and demand. Net O(2) tension within many tumors may not only depend on O(2) delivery but also depend strongly on O(2) demand. Thus, tumor O(2) consumption rates may influence tumor hypoxia up to true anoxia. Recent reports have shown that many human tumors in vivo depend primarily on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), not glycolysis, for energy generation, providing a driver for consumptive hypoxia and an exploitable vulnerability. In this regard, IACS-010759 is a novel high affinity inhibitor of OxPhos targeting mitochondrial complex-I that has recently completed a Phase-I clinical trial in leukemia. However, in solid tumors, the effective translation of OxPhos inhibitors requires methods to monitor pharmacodynamics in vivo. Herein, (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([(18)F]FAZA), a 2-nitroimidazole-based hypoxia PET imaging agent, was combined with a rigorous test-retest imaging method for non-invasive quantification of the reversal of consumptive hypoxia in vivo as a mechanism-specific pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of target engagement for IACS-010759. Neither cell death nor loss of perfusion could account for the IACS-010759-induced decrease in [(18)F]FAZA retention. Notably, in an OxPhos-reliant melanoma tumor, a titration curve using [(18)F]FAZA PET retention in vivo yielded an IC(50) for IACS-010759 (1.4 mg/kg) equivalent to analysis ex vivo. Pilot [(18)F]FAZA PET scans of a patient with grade IV glioblastoma yielded highly reproducible, high-contrast images of hypoxia in vivo as validated by CA-IX and GLUT-1 IHC ex vivo. Thus, [(18)F]FAZA PET imaging provided direct evidence for the presence of consumptive hypoxia in vivo, the capacity for targeted reversal of consumptive hypoxia through the inhibition of OxPhos, and a highly-coupled mechanism-specific PD biomarker ready for translation.

Title: Principles and current trends in the correlative evaluation of glioma with advanced MRI techniques and PET.
Abstract: Cerebral gliomas comprise a heterogeneous group of primary neoplasms of the central nervous system, representing a signifcant cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is paramount for identifying structural brain abnormalities related to the development of gliomas. Although morphological MRI remains the current standard of care for initial diagnostic workup, surgical planning, monitoring therapy response and surveillance during follow-up, it is rather diffcult to define tumor grade and boundaries and to assess response to radiochemotherapy solely by contrast-enhancement, due to a variety of factors influencing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and contrast agent distribution. The nature of a lesion lies beyond often misleading gross structural patterns, down to the cellular and molecular level, hence the imaging techniques of advanced multimodal MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged to provide critical non-invasive insight into the underlying biology of primary brain cancer. Out of the various PET radiotracers, labeled amino acids are of particular significance due to their non-dependency on BBB disruption to reach glioma cells and their excellent tumor-to-background contrast. After discussing the basic imaging principles of MR perfusion, diffusion, spectroscopy and PET in glioma, this review focuses on the correlative imaging with amino acid PET and advanced MRI techniques in tumor grading and staging, in guiding stereotactic biopsy and surgical excision and in assessing therapy response, post-therapy surveillance and prognosis. Lastly, a reference is made on the expanding availability of integrated PET/MRI systems and the resulting benefits of simultaneous image acquisition.

Title: (11)C-Methionine Integrated PET/MRI-Based Texture Analysis Features May Have a Potential Ability to Distinguish Oligodendroglioma (IDH-Mutant and 1p/19q-Codeleted) From Varied Gliomas.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Different histology and gene status of gliomas results in different natural history, treatment, and prognosis in different subgroups. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted are kind of gliomas with the most favorable outcome, reflecting operational strategy. Less invasive method for prediction of pathological type-even gene status-is desired. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigates the potential ability of methionine-positron emission tomography (MET-PET) to determine LGGs with IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted through a retrospective review of information of 70 glioma patients. Patients underwent preoperative MET-PET, followed by operation and histopathological analysis including Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction analysis for IDH-mutant and fluorescence capillary electrophoresis analysis for 1p/19q codeletion. Texture analysis was performed for further data mining. The t-test and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the whole cohort analysis, SUVmax, SUVmean and texture features (SD and median) of oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted patients were lower than these values of other patients. In WHO grade II subgroup analysis, no statistical difference of conventional features was observed between groups. Texture analysis displayed higher diffEntropy, diffVariance, and entropy in oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested AUCs of some conventional features and texture features ranged from 0.722 to 0.892 that are effective for diagnosis, determining LGGs with IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted in this cohort and WHO II grade glioma subgroup analysis respectively. CONCLUSION: (11)C-Methionine integrated PET/MRI based texture analysis and conventional features may be a promising noninvasive predictor for differentiating the varied gliomas.

Title: (13)N-NH(3) PET/CT in oncological disease.
Abstract: (13)N-Ammonia ((13)N-NH(3)) is widely used positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiotracer for the measurement of myocardial blood perfusion; the possible role of (13)N-NH(3) PET or PET/CT in oncological disease is not yet clear. Aim of this review is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of (13)N-NH(3) PET in this field. A comprehensive computer literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases was conducted including articles up to June 2019. Eighteen articles were finally included in the review. From the analyses of the selected studies, the following main findings could be drawn: (1) (13)N-NH(3) PET is useful in discriminating between gliomas and non-neoplastic brain lesions, and among gliomas between high-grade and low-grade gliomas; (2) (13)N-NH(3) PET have better diagnostic performance than (18)F-FDG in studying gliomas; (3) a combination of (13)N-NH(3) PET and (18)F-FDG PET may be useful to differentiate between several cerebral lesions (gliomas, cerebral lymphoma, meningioma); (4) only preliminary results about the positive impact in liver and prostate cancer.

Title: Diagnostic value of fusion of metabolic and structural images for stereotactic biopsy of brain tumors without enhancement after contrast medium injection.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The heterogeneous nature of glioma makes it difficult to select a target for stereotactic biopsy that will be representative of grade severity on non-contrast-enhanced lesion imaging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of fusion of metabolic images (PET 18F-DOPA) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphological images for cerebral biopsy under stereotactic conditions of glioma without contrast enhancement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study conducted between January 2016 and April 2018 included 20 consecutive patients (mean age: 45+/-19.5 years; range, 9-80 years) who underwent cerebral biopsy for a tumor without MRI enhancement but with hypermetabolism on (18)F-FDOPA PET (positron emission tomography). Standard (18)F-FDOPA uptake value (SUV(max)) was determined for diagnosis of high-grade glioma, with comparison to histomolecular results. RESULTS: Histological diagnosis was made in all patients (100%). Samples from hypermetabolism areas revealed high-grade glial tumor in 16 patients (80%). For a SUV(max) threshold of 1.75, sensitivity was 81.2%, specificity 50%, PPV 86.7% and VPN 40% for diagnosis of high-grade glioma. No significant association between SUV(max) and histomolecular mutation was found. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDOPA metabolic imaging is an aid in choosing the target to be biopsied under stereotactic conditions in tumors without MR enhancement. Nevertheless, despite good sensitivity, (18)F-FDOPA PET is insufficient for definitive diagnosis of high-grade tumor.

Title: Cost-Effectiveness of [(18)F] Fluoroethyl-L-Tyrosine for Temozolomide Therapy Assessment in Patients With Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive of all gliomas. The prognosis of these gliomas, which are classified as grade IV tumors by the World Health Organization (WHO), is poor. Combination therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy has variable outcomes and is expensive. In light of rising healthcare costs, there are societal demands for the justification of medical expenses. Therefore, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of follow-up [(18)F] fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine ([(18)F] FET) positron emission tomography (PET) scans performed on patients with glioblastoma after surgery and before commencing temozolomide maintenance treatment. Materials and Methods: To determine the cost-effectiveness of follow-up [(18)F] FET PET procedures, we examined published clinical data and calculated the associated costs in the context of Belgian healthcare. We subsequently performed one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis on the calculated ratios. Results: The decision tree based on overall survival rates showed that the number of non-responders identified using PET was 57.14% higher than the number of non-responders identified using conventional MRI. Further, the decision tree based on progression-free survival rates revealed a comparable increase of 57.50% non-responders identified. The calculated cost of two required PET scans per patient during the follow-up treatment phase was 780.50 euros. Two cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for overall survival and progression-free survival rates. Both of these calculations yielded very similar results: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 1,365.86 and 1,357.38 euros, respectively, for each identified non-responder. The findings of the sensitivity analysis supported the calculated results, confirming that the obtained data were robust. Conclusion: Our comparative study of conventional MRI and [(18)F] FET PET revealed that the latter is a valuable tool for predicting the treatment responses of patients with glioblastomas to follow-up temozolomide maintenance treatment while considering its cost-effectiveness. Thus, [(18)F] FET PET scans enable clinical outcomes to be predicted accurately and at a low cost. Moreover, given the robustness of the data in the sensitivity analyses, the level of certainty of this outcome is acceptable.

Title: A Mistaken Diagnosis of Secondary Glioblastoma as Parasitosis.
Abstract: Background: Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis requiring early diagnosis. Secondary glioblastoma refers to cases that progressed from low-grade glioma. Evidence shows that timely resection correlates with increased survival. Case presentation: We describe a case of a patient with secondary glioblastoma who was mistakenly diagnosed with Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection until 7 years after disease onset. The patient presented with non-specific clinical manifestations at disease onset. A conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the primary survey provided insufficient information, and thus failed to identify the malignancy. During follow-up, unfortunately, clinicians were misled by the patient's raw food diet, a positive serum parasite antibody and a result of low glucose metabolism on Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT). The patient was diagnosed with parasitosis. However, his condition kept getting worse under antiparasitic treatment. Preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) failed to reverse the mistaken impression. Final diagnosis was confirmed until intraoperative and postoperative pathological findings indicated glioblastoma. Conclusion: We ascribe the incorrect diagnosis to insufficient understanding on imaging manifestations of brain neoplasm as well as clinical features of parasitosis. Thus, we review the MRI, FDG-PET-CT, MRS, and DTI data of this case according to the timeline, refer to relevant studies, and point out the pitfalls. With a long course of slowly progressing, this was a rare case of secondary glioblastoma with the absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation.

Title: An atypical presentation of diffuse midline pontine glioma in a middle age patient: Case report.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Diffuse midline glioma is a newly WHO defined entity (grade IV) (Louis et al., 2016) which includes diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) reported in pediatric population and, occasionally, in young adults. Here, we present a detailed description of an atypical case of diffuse midline glioma in a 53 years old woman. CASE REPORT: A caucasian woman aged 53 from Ukraine, was referred to another neurological department complaining of 3 months history of progressive postural instability and gait impairment with frequent falling. Magnetic resonance demonstrated two brainstem lesions, hyperintense in FLAIR with "patchy" peripheral enhancement, leptomeningeal and cranial nerves enhancement. CSF was normal. Due to positive antinuclear antibodies test (ANA 1:360), intravenous steroid treatment was administered and reported to initially improve the patient condition. However, the following weeks the lady worsened. Imaging features were unchanged. Because quantiferon test resulted positive, MRI-Spectroscopy showed an inflammatory pattern and MRI perfusion study and brain FDG-PET, were normal, tubercolar granulomatous hypothesis was initially favored. Antitubercular therapy with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and rifampicin was started without any clinical improvement. Hence, the biopsy was proposed. The procedure revealed a diffuse midline pontine glioma. Considering the advanced stage of the disease, radiotherapy was not indicated. Patient died after eight months from the onset of neurological disturbances. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that diffuse midline glioma is a CNS tumor not limited to young population but occurring also in middle aged patients with an insidious pattern. We therefore recommend to perform biopsy at very early stages in patients with atypical brainstem lesions.

Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of PET Tracers for the Differentiation of Tumor Progression from Treatment-Related Changes in High-Grade Glioma: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis.
Abstract: Posttreatment high-grade gliomas are usually monitored with contrast-enhanced MRI, but its diagnostic accuracy is limited as it cannot adequately distinguish between true tumor progression and treatment-related changes. According to recent Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology recommendations, PET overcomes this limitation. However, it is currently unknown which tracer yields the best results. Therefore, a systematic review and metaanalysis were performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the different PET tracers in differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related changes in high-grade glioma patients. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched systematically. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 authors. Metaanalysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model when at least 5 studies were included. Results: The systematic review included 39 studies (11 tracers). (18)F-FDG (12 studies, 171 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% (95% confidence interval, 72%-92%) and 84% (95% confidence interval, 69%-93%), respectively. O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) (7 studies, 172 lesions) demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval, 81%-95%) and specificity of 85% (95% confidence interval, 71%-93%). For S-(11)C-methyl)-l-methionine ((11)C-MET) (8 studies, 151 lesions), sensitivity was 93% (95% confidence interval, 80%-98%) and specificity was 82% (95% confidence interval, 68%-91%). The numbers of included studies for the other tracers were too low to combine, but sensitivity and specificity ranged between 93%-100% and 0%-100%, respectively, for (18)F-FLT; 85%-100% and 72%-100%, respectively, for 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA); and 100% and 70%-88%, respectively, for (11)C-choline. Conclusion:(18)F-FET and (11)C-MET, both amino-acid tracers, showed a comparably higher sensitivity than (18)F-FDG in the differentiation between tumor progression and treatment-related changes in high-grade glioma patients. The evidence for other tracers is limited; thus, (18)F-FET and (11)C-MET are preferred when available. Our results support the incorporation of amino-acid PET tracers for the treatment evaluation of high-grade gliomas.

Title: Analysis of hypoxia in human glioblastoma tumors with dynamic 18F-FMISO PET imaging.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors and are classified as grade IV. Necrosis and hypoxia are essential diagnostic features which result in poor prognosis of gliomas. The aim of this study was to report quantitative temporal analyses aiming at determining the hypoxic regions in glioblastoma multiforme and to suggest an optimal time for the clinical single scan of hypoxia. Nine subjects were imaged with PET and 18F-FMISO in dynamic mode for 15 min followed with static scans at 2, 3 and 4 h post-injection. Spectral analysis, tumor-to-blood ratio (TBR) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (TNR) were used to delimit perfused and hypoxic tumor regions. TBR and TNR images were further scaled by thresholding at 1.2, 1.4, 2 and 2.5 levels. The images showed a varying tumor volume with time. TBR produced broader images of the tumor than TNR considering the same thresholds on intensity. Spectral analysis reliably determined hypoxia with different degrees of perfusion. By comparing TBR and TNR with spectral analysis images, weak to moderate correlation coefficients were found for most thresholding values and imaging times (range: 0 to 0.69). Hypoxic volume (HV) estimated from the net uptake rate (K(i)) were changing among imaging times. The minimum HV changes were found between 3 h and 4 h, confirming that after 3 h, there was a very low exchange of 81F-FMISO between blood and tumor. On the other hand, hypoxia started to dominate the perfused tissue at 90 min, suggesting this time is suitable for a single scan acquisition irrespective of tumor status being highly hypoxic or perfused. At this time, TBR and TNR were respectively found in the nine subjects as 1.72 +/- 0.22 and 1.74 +/- 0.19.

Title: (18)F-FET PET Imaging in Differentiating Glioma Progression from Treatment-Related Changes: A Single-Center Experience.
Abstract: In glioma patients, differentiation between tumor progression (TP) and treatment-related changes (TRCs) remains challenging. Difficulties in classifying imaging alterations may result in a delay or an unnecessary discontinuation of treatment. PET using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) has been shown to be a useful tool for detecting TP and TRCs. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 127 consecutive patients with World Health Organization grade II-IV glioma who underwent (18)F-FET PET imaging to distinguish between TP and TRCs. (18)F-FET PET findings were verified by neuropathology (40 patients) or clinicoradiologic follow-up (87 patients). Maximum tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR(max)) of (18)F-FET uptake and the slope of the time-activity curves (20-50 min after injection) were determined. The diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FET PET parameters was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis and chi(2) testing. The prognostic value of (18)F-FET PET was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: TP was diagnosed in 94 patients (74%) and TRCs in 33 (26%). For differentiating TP from TRCs, receiver-operating-characteristic analysis yielded an optimal (18)F-FET TBR(max) cutoff of 1.95 (sensitivity, 70%; specificity, 71%; accuracy, 70%; area under the curve, 0.75 +/- 0.05). The highest accuracy was achieved by a combination of TBR(max) and slope (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 67%; accuracy, 81%). However, accuracy was poorer when tumors harbored isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations (91% in IDH-wild-type tumors, 67% in IDH-mutant tumors, P < 0.001). (18)F-FET PET results correlated with overall survival (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In our neurooncology department, the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FET PET was convincing but slightly inferior to that of previous reports.

Title: Validation of magnetic resonance imaging-based automatic high-grade glioma segmentation accuracy via (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography.
Abstract: Brain Tumor Image Analysis (BraTumIA) is a fully automated segmentation tool dedicated to detecting brain tumors imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BraTumIA has recently been applied to several clinical investigations; however, the validity of this novel method has not yet been fully examined. The present study was conducted to validate the quality of tumor segmentation with BraTumIA in comparison with results from (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET). A total of 45 consecutive newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas imaged by MRI and MET-PET were analyzed. Automatic tumor segmentation was conducted by BraTumIA and the resulting segmentation images were registered to MET-PET. Three-dimensional conformal association between these two modalities was calculated, considering MET-PET as the gold standard. High underestimation and overestimation errors were observed in tumor segmentation calculated by BraTumIA compared with MET-PET. Furthermore, when the tumor/normal ratio threshold was set at 1.3 from MET-PET, the BraTumIA false-positive fraction was ~0.4 and the false-negative fraction was 0.9. By tightening this threshold to 2.0, the BraTumIA false-positive fraction was 0.6 and the false-negative fraction was 0.6. Following comparison of segmentation performance with BraTumIA with regard to glioblastoma (GBM) and World Health Organization (WHO) grade III glioma, GBM exhibited better segmentation compared with WHO grade III glioma. Although BraTumIA may be able to detect enhanced tumors, non-enhancing tumors and necrosis, the spatial concordance rate with MET-PET was relatively low. Careful interpretation is therefore required when using this technique.

Title: Utility of FET-PET in detecting high-grade gliomas presenting with equivocal MR imaging features.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas, metastases, and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are common high-grade brain lesions, which may have overlapping features on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our objective was to assess the utility of 18-fluoride-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) in reliably differentiating between these lesions, by studying their metabolic characteristics. Patients with high-grade brain lesions suspicious for glioma, with overlapping features for metastases and PCNSL were referred for FET-PET by Neuroradiologists from Multidisciplinary Neuro-Oncology Joint Clinic. Tumor-to-contralateral white mater ratio (T/Wm) at 5 and 20 min was derived and compared to histopathology. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to find the optimal T/Wm cutoff to differentiate between the tumor types. T/Wm was higher for glial tumors compared to nonglial tumors (metastases, PCNSL, tuberculoma, and anaplastic meningioma). A cutoff of 1.9 was derived to reliably diagnose a tumor of glial origin with a sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 91%, respectively. FET-PET can be used to diagnose glial tumors presenting as high-grade brain lesions when MR findings show overlapping features for other common high-grade lesions.

Title: Ultrasmall Core-Shell Silica Nanoparticles for Precision Drug Delivery in a High-Grade Malignant Brain Tumor Model.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Small-molecule inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of certain genomically defined solid cancers. Despite breakthroughs in treating systemic disease, central nervous system (CNS) metastatic progression is common, and advancements in treating CNS malignancies remain sparse. By improving drug penetration across a variably permeable blood-brain barrier and diffusion across intratumoral compartments, more uniform delivery and distribution can be achieved to enhance efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ultrasmall fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, Cornell prime dots (C' dots), were functionalized with alpha(v) integrin-binding (cRGD), or nontargeting (cRAD) peptides, and PET labels ((124)I, (89)Zr) to investigate the utility of dual-modality cRGD-C' dots for enhancing accumulation, distribution, and retention (ADR) in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioblastoma (mGBM). mGBMs were systemically treated with (124)I-cRGD- or (124)I-cRAD-C' dots and sacrificed at 3 and 96 hours, with concurrent intravital injections of FITC-dextran for mapping blood-brain barrier breakdown and the nuclear stain Hoechst. We further assessed target inhibition and ADR following attachment of dasatinib, creating nanoparticle-drug conjugates (Das-NDCs). Imaging findings were confirmed with ex vivo autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and p-S6RP IHC. RESULTS: Improvements in brain tumor delivery and penetration, as well as enhancement in the ADR, were observed following administration of integrin-targeted C' dots, as compared with a nontargeted control. Furthermore, attachment of the small-molecule inhibitor, dasatinib, led to its successful drug delivery throughout mGBM, demonstrated by downstream pathway inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that highly engineered C' dots are promising drug delivery vehicles capable of navigating the complex physiologic barriers observed in a clinically relevant brain tumor model.

Title: TSPO PET, tumour grading and molecular genetics in histologically verified glioma: a correlative (18)F-GE-180 PET study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is overexpressed in brain tumours and represents an interesting target for glioma imaging. (18)F-GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, has shown improved binding affinity and a high target-to-background contrast in patients with glioblastoma. However, the association of uptake characteristics on TSPO PET using (18)F-GE-180 with the histological WHO grade and molecular genetic features so far remains unknown and was evaluated in the current study. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with histologically validated glioma at initial diagnosis or recurrence were included. All patients underwent (18)F-GE-180 PET, and the maximal and mean tumour-to-background ratios (TBR(max), TBR(mean)) as well as the PET volume were assessed. On MRI, presence/absence of contrast enhancement was evaluated. Imaging characteristics were correlated with neuropathological parameters (i.e. WHO grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation). RESULTS: Six of 58 patients presented with WHO grade II, 16/58 grade III and 36/58 grade IV gliomas. An (IDH) mutation was found in 19/58 cases, and 39/58 were classified as IDH-wild type. High (18)F-GE-180-uptake was observed in all but 4 cases (being WHO grade II glioma, IDH-mutant). A high association of (18)F-GE-180-uptake and WHO grades was seen: WHO grade IV gliomas showed the highest uptake intensity compared with grades III and II gliomas (median TBR(max) 5.15 (2.59-8.95) vs. 3.63 (1.85-7.64) vs. 1.63 (1.50-3.43), p < 0.001); this association with WHO grades persisted within the IDH-wild-type and IDH-mutant subgroup analyses (p < 0.05). Uptake intensity was also associated with the IDH mutational status with a trend towards higher (18)F-GE-180-uptake in IDH-wild-type gliomas in the overall group (median TBR(max) 4.67 (1.56-8.95) vs. 3.60 (1.50-7.64), p = 0.083); however, within each WHO grade, no differences were found (e.g. median TBR(max) in WHO grade III glioma 4.05 (1.85-5.39) vs. 3.36 (2.32-7.64), p = 1.000). No association was found between uptake intensity and MGMT or TERT (p > 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: Uptake characteristics on (18)F-GE-180 PET are highly associated with the histological WHO grades, with the highest (18)F-GE-180 uptake in WHO grade IV glioblastomas and a PET-positive rate of 100% among the investigated high-grade gliomas. Conversely, all TSPO-negative cases were WHO grade II gliomas. The observed association of (18)F-GE-180 uptake and the IDH mutational status seems to be related to the high inter-correlation of the IDH mutational status and the WHO grades.

Title: Development of a thin layer chromatography method for plasma correction of [(18)F]fluorocholine metabolites in positron emission tomography quantification studies in humans.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: After its intravenous injection, [(18)F]fluorocholine is oxidized by choline-oxidase into its main plasma metabolite, [(18)F]fluorobetaine. If PET kinetic modeling quantification of [(18)F]fluorocholine uptake is intended, the plasma input time-activity-curve of the parent tracer must be obtained, i.e., the fraction of the total plasma radioactivity corresponding to the nonmetabolized [(18)F]fluorocholine at each time has to be known. Hence our aim was to develop an easy-routine Thin-Layer-Chromatography (TLC) method to separate and quantify the relative fractions of [(18)F]fluorocholine and [(18)F]fluorobetaine as a function of time during PET imaging in humans. METHODS: First, we tested several combinations of solvents systems and layers to select the one showing the best resolution on non-radioactive standards. Thereafter, [(18)F]fluorobetaine was obtained through chemical oxidation of an [(18)F]fluorocholine sample at diferent incubation times and we applied the selected TLC-system to aliquots of this oxidation solution, both in a saline and in human deproteinized plasma matrices. The plates were detected by a radio-TLC-scanner. This TLC-system was finally applied to arterial plasma samples from 9 patients with high-grade-glioma undergoing brain PET imaging and a parent fraction curve was obtained in each of them. RESULTS: A TLC-system based on Silica-Gel-60//MeOH-NH(3) was selected from the choline/betaine non-radioactive standards assay. Radiochromatograms of [(18)F]fluorocholine oxidation solution yielded two separated and well-defined peaks, Rf = 0,03 ([(18)F]fluorocholine) and Rf = 0.78 ((18)F]fluorobetaine) consistent with those observed on non-radioactive standards. During the oxidation, the [(18)F]fluorocholine radioactivity peak decreased progressively at several incubation times, while the other peak ([(18)F]fluorobetaine) increased accordingly. The mean values of the parent fraction of [(18)F]fluorocholine of the 9 patients studied (mean+/-SD) were 94% +/- 6%, 58% +/- 15%, 43% +/- 10%, 39% +/- 6% and 37% +/- 6% at 2.8 min, 5.8 min, 8.8 min, 11.7 min and 14.7 min post-injection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a TLC-system, easy to perform in a standard radiopharmacy unit, that enables the metabolite correction of arterial input function of [(18)F]fluorocholine in patients undergoing PET oncologic quantitative imaging.

Title: Combining 3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine and MRI increases the sensitivity of glioma volume detection.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: 3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) is a marker of cell proliferation and displays a high tumor-to-background ratio in brain tumor lesions. We determined whether combining 18F-FLT PET and MRI study improves the detection of tumoral tissue compared to MRI alone and whether 18F-FLT uptake has a prognostic value by studying its association with histopathological features. METHODS: Thirteen patients with a supratentorial malignant glioma were recruited and scheduled for surgery. The tumor volume was defined in all patients on both 18F-FLT PET and MRI images. The images were coregistered and uploaded onto a neuronavigation system. During surgery, an average of 11 biopsies per patient were taken in regions of the brain that were positive to one or both imaging modalities, as well as from control peritumoral regions. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of each biopsy region were correlated to histopathological data (i.e., proliferation index and number of mitoses) and the SUV values of high and low-grade samples were compared. RESULTS: Out of a total of 149 biopsies, 109 contained tumoral tissue at histopathological analysis. The positive predictive value was 93.1% for MRI alone and 78.3% for MRI and PET combined. In addition, 40% of the biopsy samples taken from areas of the brain that were negative at both PET and MRI had evidence of malignancy at pathology. The SUV values were not significantly correlated to either the proliferation index or the number of mitoses, and could not differentiate between high- and low-grade samples. CONCLUSION: In patients with newly diagnosed glioma, a combination of MRI and 18F-FLT-PET detects additional tumoral tissue and this may lead to a more complete surgical resection. Also, the addition of a negative PET to a negative MRI increases the negative predictive value. However, 18F-FLT still underestimated the margins of the lesion and did not correlate with histopathological features.

Title: Non-invasive prediction of IDH-wildtype genotype in gliomas using dynamic (18)F-FET PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: According to the updated WHO classification of gliomas with its emphasis on molecular parameters, tumours with an IDH-wildtype status have a dismal prognosis. To ensure timely adjustment of treatment, demand for non-invasive prediction methods is high. (18)F-FET PET has been shown to be an important diagnostic tool for glioma management. The aim of this study was to assess the value of dynamic (18)F-FET PET for the non-invasive prediction of the IDH-mutation status. METHODS: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-IV glioma patients with MRI and dynamic (18)F-FET PET were included. The (18)F-FET PET parameters mean and maximal tumour-to-background ratio (TBR(mean), TBR(max)) and minimal time-to-peak (TTP(min)) were evaluated. The diagnostic power for the prediction of the IDH genotype (positive/negative predictive value) was tested in the overall study group and in the subgroup of non-contrast enhancing gliomas. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one patients were evaluated. Molecular analyses revealed 178 IDH-mutant and 163 IDH-wildtype tumours. Overall, 270/341 gliomas were classified as (18)F-FET-positive (TBR(max) > 1.6), 90.2% of the IDH-wildtype and 69.1% of IDH-mutant gliomas. Median TBR(max) was significantly higher in IDH-wildtype compared with IDH-mutant gliomas (2.9 vs. 2.3, p < 0.001); however, ROC-analyses revealed no reliable cutoff due to a high overlap (range 1.0-7.1 vs. 1.1-7.9). Dynamic analysis revealed a significantly shorter TTP(min) in IDH-wildtype gliomas; using TTP(min) </= 12.5 min as indicator for IDH-wildtype gliomas, a positive predictive value of 87% was reached (negative predictive value 72%, AUC = 0.796, p </= 0.001). A total of 161/341 gliomas did not show contrast enhancement on MRI; even within this subgroup, TTP(min) </= 12.5 min remained a good predictor of IDH-wildtype glioma (positive predictive value 83%, negative predictive value 90%; AUC = 0.868, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A short TTP(min) in dynamic (18)F-FET PET serves as good predictor of highly aggressive IDH-wildtype status in gliomas. In particular, a high diagnostic power was observed in the subgroup of non-contrast enhancing gliomas, which helps to identify patients with worse prognosis.

Title: IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a new diagnostic approach allowing the visualization of tumor stroma. Here, we applied FAP-specific PET imaging to gliomas. We analyzed the target affinity and specificity of two FAP ligands (FAPI-02 and FAPI-04) in vitro, and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice in vivo. Clinically, we used (68)Ga-labeled FAPI-02/04 for PET imaging in 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas, 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). METHODS: For binding studies with (177)Lu-radiolabeled FAPI-02/04, we used the glioblastoma cell line U87MG, FAP-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, and CD26-transfected human embryonic kidney cells. For pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies, U87MG-xenografted mice were injected with (68)Ga-labeled compounds followed by small-animal PET imaging and (177)Lu-labeled FAPI-02/04, respectively. Clinical PET/CT scans were performed 30 min post intravenous administration of (68)Ga-FAPI-02/04. PET and MRI scans were co-registrated. Immunohistochemistry was done on 14 gliomas using a FAP-specific antibody. RESULTS: FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 showed high binding specificity to FAP. FAPI-04 demonstrated higher tumor accumulation and delayed elimination compared with FAPI-02 in preclinical studies. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV, but not grade II, IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake. In glioblastomas, we observed spots with increased uptake in projection on contrast-enhancing areas. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-positive cells with mainly elongated cell bodies and perivascular FAP-positive cells in glioblastomas and an anaplastic IDH-mutant astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Using FAP-specific PET imaging, increased tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytomas, but not in diffuse astrocytomas, may allow non-invasive distinction between low-grade IDH-mutant and high-grade gliomas. Therefore, FAP-specific imaging in gliomas may be useful for follow-up studies although further clinical evaluation is required.

Title: Diagnostic and grading accuracy of (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT in patients with gliomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F] fluoro-L-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) has been used in the evaluation of gliomas. We performed a meta-analysis to obtain the diagnostic and grading accuracy of (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT in patients with gliomas. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched through 13 May 2019. We included studies reporting the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDOPA PET or PET/CT in glioma patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated from eligible studies on a per-lesion basis. RESULTS: Eventually, 19 studies were included. Across 13 studies (370 patients) for glioma diagnosis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT were 0.90 (95%CI: 0.86-0.93) and 0.75 (95%CI: 0.65-0.83). Across 7 studies (219 patients) for glioma grading, (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.81-0.93) and a pooled specificity of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.64-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT demonstrated good performance for diagnosing gliomas and differentiating high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from low-grade gliomas (LGGs). Further studies implementing standardized PET protocols and investigating the grading parameters are needed.

Title: Diagnostic performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the evaluation of glioma.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Identifying glioma grade through imaging allows clinicians to recommend and accurately direct treatment. We sought to quantify the utility of FDG-PET/CT (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography), alone and in combination with MRI, in identifying high-grade regions of glioma. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients who had an FDG-PET/CT performed as part of the workup of suspected glioma or in follow-up of known glioma. FDG-PET/CT scans were reviewed and uptake in the identifiable lesion coded as none, diffusely or focally increased. Patients also underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI, noting regions of contrast enhancement. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated for identification of high-grade histology (WHO III or IV, or metastatic disease) obtained post-FDG-PET/CT. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients had 36 FDG-PET/CT and MRI scans followed by histological confirmation (biopsy or debulking). Increased FDG uptake demonstrated a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 79%, PPV of 81% and NPV of 55% for identification of high-grade histology. MRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 86%, PPV of 89% and NPV of 71% for identification of high-grade histology. Only 64% of MRI and FDG-PET/CT scan series were concordant. When FDG-PET/CT and MRI were concordant, a specificity of 100% and PPV of 100% was achieved, however, sensitivity was 79% and NPV was 75%. CONCLUSION: The combination of FDG-PET/CT and gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated marked improvement in identifying potential high-grade disease over each modality alone. Increased FDG uptake without gadolinium enhancement rarely occurred and identified high-grade histology in a small number of patients. Due to limited sensitivity and NPV, a negative FDG-PET/CT alone, or in combination with MRI, should not guide a decision for observation where surgery would otherwise be recommended.

Title: The Roles of Hypoxia Imaging Using (18)F-Fluoromisonidazole Positron Emission Tomography in Glioma Treatment.
Abstract: Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor. Hypoxia is closely related to the malignancy of gliomas, and positron emission tomography (PET) can noninvasively visualize the degree and the expansion of hypoxia. Currently, (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) is the most common radiotracer for hypoxia imaging. The clinical usefulness of FMISO PET has been established; it can distinguish glioblastomas from lower-grade gliomas and can predict the microenvironment of a tumor, including necrosis, vascularization, and permeability. FMISO PET provides prognostic information, including survival and treatment response information. Because hypoxia decreases a tumor's sensitivity to radiation therapy, dose escalation to an FMISO-positive volume is an attractive strategy. Although this idea is not new, an insufficient amount of evidence has been obtained regarding this concept. New tracers for hypoxia imaging such as (18)F-DiFA are being tested. In the future, hypoxia imaging will play an important role in glioma management.

Title: Report of first recurrent glioma patients examined with PET-MRI prior to re-irradiation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The advantage of combined PET-MRI over sequential PET and MRI is the high spatial conformity and the absence of time delay between the examinations. The benefit of this technique for planning of re-irradiation (re-RT) treatment is unkown yet. Imaging data from a phase 1 trial of re-RT for recurrent glioma was analysed to assess whether planning target volumes and treatment margins in glioma re-RT can be adjusted by PET-MRI with rater independent PET based biological tumour volumes (BTVs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Combined PET-MRI with the tracer O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) prior to re-RT was performed in recurrent glioma patients in a phase I trial. GTVs including all regions suspicious of tumour on contrast enhanced MRI were delineated by three experienced radiation oncologists and included into MRI based consensus GTVs (MRGTVs). BTVs were semi-automatically delineated with a fixed threshold of 1.6 x background activity. Corresponding BTVs and MRGTVs were fused into union volume PET-MRGTVs. The Sorensen-Dice coefficient and the conformity index were used to assess the geometric overlap of the BTVs with the MRGTVs. A recurrence pattern analysis was performed based on the original planning target volumes (PTVs = GTV + 10 mm margin or 5 mm in one case) and the PET-MRGTVs with margins of 10, 8, 5 and 3 mm. RESULTS: Seven recurrent glioma patients, who received PET-MRI prior to re-RT, were included into the present planning study. At the time of re-RT, patients were in median 54 years old and had a median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of 80. Median post-recurrence survival after the beginning of re-RT was 13 months. Concomitant bevacizumab therapy was applied in six patients and one patient received chemoradiation with temozolomide. Median GTV volumes of the three radiation oncologists were 35.0, 37.5 and 40.5 cubic centimeters (cc) and median MRGTV volume 41.8 cc. Median BTV volume was 36.6 cc and median PET-MRGTV volume 59.3 cc. The median Sorensen-Dice coefficient for the comparison between MRGTV and BTV was 0.61 and the median conformity index 0.44. Recurrence pattern analysis revealed two central, two in-field and one distant recurrence within both, the original PTV, as well as the PET-MRGTV with a reduced margin of 3 mm. CONCLUSION: PET-MRI provides radiation treatment planning imaging with high spatial and timely conformity for high-grade glioma patients treated with re-RT with potential advancements for target volume delineation. Prospective randomised trials are warranted to further investigate the treatment benefits of PET-MRI based re-RT planning.

Title: 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in the Prediction of Molecular Subtypes and Prognosis for Gliomas.
Abstract: AIM: To study the association of metabolic features of F-fluorocholine in gliomas with histopathological and molecular parameters, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Prospective multicenter and nonrandomized study (Functional and Metabolic Glioma Analysis). Patients underwent a basal F-fluorocholine PET/CT and were included after histological confirmation of glioma. Histological and molecular profile was assessed: grade, Ki-67, isocitrate dehydrogenase status and 1p/19q codeletion. Patients underwent standard treatment after surgery or biopsy, depending on their clinical situation. Overall survival and PFS were obtained after follow-up. After tumor segmentation of PET images, SUV and volume-based variables, sphericity, surface, coefficient of variation, and multilesionality were obtained. Relations of metabolic variables with histological, molecular profile and prognosis were evaluated using Pearson chi and t test. Receiver operator caracteristic curves were used to obtain the cutoff of PET variables. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were assessed; 38 were diagnosed as having high-grade gliomas. Significant differences of SUV-based variables with isocitrate dehydrogenase status, tumor grade, and Ki-67 were found. Tumor grade, Ki-67, SUVmax, and SUVmean were related to progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant associations of SUVmax, SUVmean, and multilesionaly with OS and PFS. SUVmean, sphericity, and multilesionality were independent predictors of OS and PFS in Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic information obtained from F-fluorocholine PET of patients with glioma may be useful in the prediction of tumor biology and patient prognosis.

Title: (18)F-Fluoroethyl-tyrosine uptake is correlated with amino acid transport and neovascularization in treatment-naive glioblastomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the in vivo correlation between (18)F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) uptake and amino acid transporter expression and vascularization in treatment-naive glioblastomas. METHODS: A total of 43 stereotactic biopsies were obtained from 13 patients with suspected glioblastoma prior to therapy. All patients underwent a dynamic (18)F-FET PET/MRI scan before biopsy. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against SLC7A5 (amino acid transporter), MIB-1 (Ki67, proliferation), CD31 (vascularization) and CA-IX (hypoxia). The intensity of staining was correlated with (18)F-FET uptake and the dynamic (18)F-FET uptake slope at the biopsy target point. RESULTS: In all patients, the final diagnosis was IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Static (18)F-FET uptake was significantly correlated with SLC7A5 staining (r = 0.494, p = 0.001). While the dynamic (18)F-FET uptake slope did not show a significant correlation with amino acid transporter expression, it was significantly correlated with the number of CD31-positive vessels (r = -0.350, p = 0.031), which is line with earlier results linking (18)F-FET kinetics with vascularization and perfusion. Besides, static (18)F-FET uptake also showed correlations with CA-IX staining (r = 0.394, p = 0.009) and CD31 positivity (r = 0.410, p = 0.006). While the correlation between static (18)F-FET uptake and SLC7A5 staining was confirmed as significant in multivariate analysis, this was not the case for the correlation with CD31 positivity, most likely because of the lower effect size and the relatively low number of samples. No significant correlation between (18)F-FET uptake and Ki67 proliferation index was observed in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results support the findings of preclinical studies suggesting that specific (18)F-FET uptake in glioblastomas is mediated by amino acid transporters. As proposed previously, dynamic (18)F-FET parameters might be more influenced by perfusion and therefore related to properties of the tumour neovascularization.

Title: Combined PET/MRI in brain glioma imaging.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumours in children and adults, consisting of a heterogeneous group of neoplastic diseases arise from the supporting cells of the CNS (glial cells). Their histopathological and molecular characteristics vary considerably as do their management and prognosis. Conventional gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the primary imaging modality for initial work up and follow up of patients with gliomas, although it has some limitations, especially in differentiating high from low grade tumours and in distinguishing disease recurrence from post-therapy changes. Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI is a relatively novel tool that combines MRI sequences with metabolic information from PET, and therefore different PET radiotracers, in a single scan. This article discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of combined PET/MRI compared to other conventional or more widely available imaging tools, such as MRI or combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The main uses of PET/MRI and the most commonly used PET radiotracers in providing diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in patients with glioma are covered.

Title: Diverse Behavior in 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT of Brain Tumors in Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
Abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes CNS tumors in around 20% of patients, being pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), and particularly optic pathway gliomas (OPG), the most common. We present three cases of NF1 patients referred for F-fluorocholine PET/CT because of suspected glioma in the setting of ongoing FUMEGA (Functional and Metabolic Glioma Analysis) trial. One case turned out to be a WHO grade I ganglioglioma; the second was a high grade glioma; and the last one (negative in PET) a probable low-grade glioma.

Title: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Suspected Residual or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To retrospectively investigate the uptake of F-fluciclovine on PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). METHODS: Twenty-one patients were included. The standard of truth was histopathologic interpretation if available. When histopathology was not available or rebiopsy did not show signs of malignancy, clinical follow-up including MRI and clinical outcome was considered the standard of truth. RESULTS: All 21 patients met the reference standard of either histopathologic proof of HGG recurrence (n = 10) or disease progression clinically and with tumor growth corresponding to the primary tumor sites on follow-up MRI (n = 11). Median time from PET/CT to death was 5 months (range, 1-20 months). Median time from primary diagnosis to death was 14.5 months (range, 6 to >400). Average SUVmax of the lesions was 8.3 +/- 5.3 (SD) and 0.34 +/- 0.13 for normal brain tissue. Median lesion-to-background ratio was 21.6 (range, 3.1-84.4). In 4 patients, F-fluciclovine PET/CT detected small satellite tumors that had not been reported on MR. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of F-fluciclovine in clinically and/or histopathologically confirmed recurrent HGG is high compared with the uptake reported for other amino acid PET tracers. Because of the high tumor uptake and thus high tracer contrast, small satellite tumors with a diameter below usual reported PET spatial resolution and not reported on MRI were detected in 4 patients. As no patients with confirmed treatment-related changes were included, we cannot as of yet ascertain the ability of F-fluciclovine PET to discriminate between recurrent HGG and treatment-related changes, for example, pseudoprogression and radionecrosis.

Title: (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) PET imaging of GRPR in children with optic pathway glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a rare neoplasm that arises predominantly during childhood. Its location in a sensitive region involving the optic pathways, onset in young patients and controversial therapy choice make the management of OPG a challenge in paediatric neuro-oncology. In this study we assessed gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in children with OPG, and the application of a PET/MRI imaging-guided surgery navigation platform. METHODS: Eight children (five boys, mean age 8.81 years, range 5-14 years) with suspicion of optic pathway glioma on MRI were recruited. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and legal guardians. Brain PET/CT or PET/MRI acquisitions were performed 30 min after intravenous injection of 1.85 MBq/kg body weight of (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14). Four patients also underwent (18)F-FDG brain PET/CT for comparison. All patients underwent surgical resection within 1 week. RESULTS: All 11 lesions (100%) in the eight patients showed prominent (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) uptake with excellent contrast in relation to surrounding normal brain tissue. Tumour-to-background ratios (SUVmax and SUVmean) were significantly higher for (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) than for (18)F-FDG (28.4 +/- 5.59 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.11 and 18.3 +/- 4.99 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.07, respectively). Fusion images for tumour delineation were obtained in all patients using the PET/MRI navigation platform. All lesions were pathologically confirmed as OPGs with positive GRPR expression, and 75% were pilocytic astrocytoma WHO grade I and 25% were diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade II. There was a positive correlation between the SUV of (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) and the expression level of GRPR (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01, for SUVmax; r(2) = 0.47, P < 0.05, for SUVmean). CONCLUSION: This prospective study showed the feasibility of (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) PET in children with OPG for tumour detection and localization. (68)Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) PET/MRI may be helpful for assisting surgery planning in OPG patients with severe symptoms, GRPR-targeted PET has the potential to provide imaging guidance for further GRPR-targeted therapy in patients with OPG.

Title: Hypoxia Imaging and Adaptive Radiotherapy: A State-of-the-Art Approach in the Management of Glioma.
Abstract: Severe hypoxia [oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) below 5-10 mmHg] is more frequent in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared to lower-grade gliomas. Seminal studies in the 1950s demonstrated that hypoxia was associated with increased resistance to low-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. In experimental conditions, the total radiation dose has to be multiplied by a factor of 3 to achieve the same cell lethality in anoxic situations. The presence of hypoxia in human tumors is assumed to contribute to treatment failures after radiotherapy (RT) in cancer patients. Therefore, a logical way to overcome hypoxia-induced radioresistance would be to deliver substantially higher doses of RT in hypoxic volumes delineated on pre-treatment imaging as biological target volumes (BTVs). Such an approach faces various fundamental, technical, and clinical challenges. The present review addresses several technical points related to the delineation of hypoxic zones, which include: spatial accuracy, quantitative vs. relative threshold, variations of hypoxia levels during RT, and availability of hypoxia tracers. The feasibility of hypoxia imaging as an assessment tool for early tumor response to RT and for predicting long-term outcomes is discussed. Hypoxia imaging for RT dose painting is likewise examined. As for the radiation oncologist's point of view, hypoxia maps should be converted into dose-distribution objectives for RT planning. Taking into account the physics and the radiobiology of various irradiation beams, preliminary in silico studies are required to investigate the feasibility of dose escalation in terms of normal tissue tolerance before clinical trials are undertaken.

Title: Awake Craniotomy and Resection of a Left Frontal High-Grade Glioma: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.
Abstract: A 48-yr-old female patient presented in our outpatients' clinic after an episode of speech arrest and seizures a week earlier. On physical examination, there were no neurological deficits. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast-enhancing tumor of the superior and middle frontal gyrus. A 18F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) showed a high tracer uptake, and we suspected the lesion to be a high-grade glioma. The tumor was located next to the cortical motor and language areas. We performed a left frontal craniotomy while the patient was asleep, and then conducted cortical and subcortical stimulation under an awake condition. The patient was asked to move her right upper extremity and to name objects. Based on MRI navigation, we achieved a complete tumor resection. Postoperative imaging confirmed gross total resection, and final histopathology revealed an anaplastic astrocytoma isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mut, 1p19q noncodeleted WHO degrees III. The patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day with a supplementary motor area syndrome and diminishing word-finding difficulties. We safely achieved gross total tumor resection in a highly eloquent localization through awake craniotomy with direct cortical and subcortical stimulation and electrophysiological monitoring. Awake craniotomy remains the gold standard for tumor resection in eloquent language areas in our clinics.  We obtained informed consent from the patient.

Title: Performance of 18F-FDG, 11C-Methionine, and 18F-FET PET for Glioma Grading: A Meta-analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Gliomas constitute the most frequent primary brain tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common and malignant glioma in adults, has dismal prognosis with any current therapy. On the other hand, low-grade gliomas, the second most common type of gliomas, are potentially curative with appropriate treatment. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the performance of PET tracers with the best available evidence, namely, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), C-methionine (MET), and F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET), in differentiating low- from high-grade gliomas. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with a total of 994 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivities of both MET PET and FET PET were found to be significantly higher than of FDG PET (94%, 88%, and 63% respectively, P < 0.001). The pooled specificity of FDG PET was found to be significantly greater compared with both MET PET and FET PET (89%, 55%, and 57%, respectively; P = 0.002). Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was superior in terms of higher positive likelihood ratio values compared with both FET PET and MET PET. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that both MET and FET were superior to FDG in terms of sensitivity for identifying glioma grade.

Title: Differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumour progression: a direct comparison between dynamic FET PET and ADC values obtained from DWI MRI.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Following brain cancer treatment, the capacity of anatomical MRI to differentiate neoplastic tissue from treatment-related changes (e.g., pseudoprogression) is limited. This study compared apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) obtained by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) with static and dynamic parameters of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumour progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight pretreated high-grade glioma patients with anatomical MRI findings suspicious for progression (median time elapsed since last treatment was 16 weeks) were investigated using DWI and dynamic FET PET. Maximum and mean tumour-to-brain ratios (TBR(max), TBR(mean)) as well as dynamic parameters (time-to-peak and slope values) of FET uptake were calculated. For mean ADC calculation, regions-of-interest analyses were performed on ADC maps calculated from DWI coregistered with the contrast-enhanced MR image. Diagnoses were confirmed neuropathologically (21%) or clinicoradiologically. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver-operating-characteristic analyses or Fisher's exact test for a combinational approach. RESULTS: Ten of 48 patients had treatment-related changes (21%). The diagnostic performance of FET PET was significantly higher (threshold for both TBR(max) and TBR(mean), 1.95; accuracy, 83%; AUC, 0.89 +/- 0.05; P < 0.001) than that of ADC values (threshold ADC, 1.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; accuracy, 69%; AUC, 0.73 +/- 0.09; P = 0.13). The addition of static FET PET parameters to ADC values increased the latter's accuracy to 89%. The highest accuracy was achieved by combining static and dynamic FET PET parameters (93%). Moreover, in contrast to ADC values, TBRs <1.95 at suspected progression predicted a significantly longer survival (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that static and dynamic FET PET provide valuable information concerning the differentiation of early treatment-related changes from tumour progression and outperform ADC measurement for this highly relevant clinical question.

Title: Histogram analysis of 11C-methionine integrated PET/MRI may facilitate to determine the O6-methylguanylmethyltransferase methylation status in gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the O6-methylguanylmethyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status noninvasively by analyzing radiomics features of C-methionine (MET) PET images, which may reflect the detailed biological properties of gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas, who were initially examined with C-MET PET/MR were retrospectively enrolled. Quantitative uptake of MET was assessed using conventional, histogram and texture features. These features were compared between the two groups classified by MGMT promoter methylation status. RESULTS: The histogram features (Skewness and Kurtosis) of the MGMT methylated group were significantly higher than those of the MGMT unmethylated group (Skewness: 0.90 +/- 0.71 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.45; P = 0.01) (Kurtosis: 1.36 +/- 2.30 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.65; P = 0.003), but there were no significant differences in Skewness or Kurtosis between the groups in glioma-grade-matched subgroup analysis. Moreover, there was no significant difference in other features between the methylated group and unmethylated group. CONCLUSION: The histogram features (Skewness and Kurtosis) of MET PET/MRI may be two key indicators to detect MGMT methylation status in gliomas and valuable predictors for the clinical responses of patients scheduled to receive temozolomide chemotherapeutics.

Title: 18F-FACBC PET/MRI in Diagnostic Assessment and Neurosurgery of Gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the amino acid tracer F-FACBC with simultaneous PET/MRI in diagnostic assessment and neurosurgery of gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with suspected primary or recurrent low- or high-grade glioma received an F-FACBC PET/MRI examination before surgery. PET and MRI were used for diagnostic assessment, and for guiding tumor resection and histopathological tissue sampling. PET uptake, tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs), time-activity curves, as well as PET and MRI tumor volumes were evaluated. The sensitivities of lesion detection and to detect glioma tissue were calculated for PET, MRI, and combined PET/MRI with histopathology (biopsies for final diagnosis and additional image-localized biopsies) as reference. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for lesion detection was 54.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.4-83.3) for PET, 45.5% (95% CI, 16.7-76.6) for contrast-enhanced MRI (MRICE), and 100% (95% CI, 71.5-100.0) for combined PET/MRI, with a significant difference between MRICE and combined PET/MRI (P = 0.031). TBRs increased with tumor grade (P = 0.004) and were stable from 10 minutes post injection. PET tumor volumes enclosed most of the MRICE volumes (>98%) and were generally larger (1.5-2.8 times) than the MRICE volumes. Based on image-localized biopsies, combined PET/MRI demonstrated higher concurrence with malignant findings at histopathology (89.5%) than MRICE (26.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Low- versus high-grade glioma differentiation may be possible with F-FACBC using TBR. F-FACBC PET/MRI outperformed MRICE in lesion detection and in detection of glioma tissue. More research is required to evaluate F-FACBC properties, especially in grade II and III tumors, and for different subtypes of gliomas.

Title: Re-evaluation of the diagnostic performance of (11)C-methionine PET/CT according to the 2016 WHO classification of cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We evaluated the usefulness of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for grading cerebral gliomas according to the 2016 WHO classification with special emphasis on the presence of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. METHODS: In total, 144 patients underwent MET PET/CT before surgery. The ratios of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the gliomas to the mean SUV of the contralateral cortex on MET PET/CT (MET TNR) were calculated. RESULTS: The median MET TNRs in IDH1-mutant and IDH1-wildtype tumours were 1.95 and 3.35, respectively. From among 74 IDH1-mutant tumours, the oligodendrogliomas showed a higher median MET TNR than the astrocytic tumours (2.90 vs. 1.40, P < 0.001). In grade II, III and IV IDH1-mutant astrocytic tumours, the median MET TNRs were 1.20, 2.05 and 2.20, respectively (grade II vs. grade III, P < 0.0001; grade II vs. grade IV, P = 0.023). In oligodendrogliomas, the MET TNR was lower fin grade II tumours than in grade III tumours (2.30 vs. 3.30 P = 0.008). In differentiating low-grade (grade II) from high-grade (grade III and IV) gliomas, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed a higher area under the curve for wildtype tumours (0.976) than for all tumours (0.852; P < 0.001) and IDH1-mutant tumours (0.817; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: IDH1-mutant tumours showed lower MET uptake than IDH1-wildtype tumours. Regardless of IDH1 mutation status, oligodendrogliomas with 1p/19q codeletion showed MET uptake as high as that in high-grade IDH1-wildtype tumours. Therefore, MET uptake for glioma grading was more consistent for IDH1-wildtype tumours than for IDH1-mutant tumours.

Title: Photopenic defects on O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET: clinical relevance in glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET has a sensitivity of more than 90% to detect gliomas. In the remaining small fraction of gliomas without increased tracer uptake, some tumors even show photopenic defects whose clinical significance is unclear. METHODS: Glioma patients with a negative FET PET scan prior to neuropathological confirmation were identified retrospectively. Gliomas were rated visually as (i) having indifferent FET uptake or (ii) photopenic, if FET uptake was below background activity. FET uptake in the area of signal hyperintensity on the T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery-weighted MRI was evaluated by mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and mean tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR). The progression-free survival (PFS) of photopenic gliomas was compared with that of gliomas with indifferent FET uptake. RESULTS: Of 100 FET-negative gliomas, 40 cases with photopenic defects were identified. Fifteen of these 40 cases (38%) had World Health Organization (WHO) grades III and IV gliomas. FET uptake in photopenic gliomas was significantly decreased compared with both the healthy-appearing brain tissue (SUV, 0.89 +/- 0.26 vs 1.08 +/- 0.23; P < 0.001) and gliomas with indifferent FET uptake (TBR, 0.82 +/- 0.09 vs 0.96 +/- 0.13; P < 0.001). Irrespective of the applied treatment, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma patients with indifferent FET uptake (n = 25) had a significantly longer PFS than patients with IDH-mutated diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II) with photopenic defects (n = 11) (51 vs 24 mo; P = 0.027). The multivariate survival analysis indicated that photopenic defects predict an unfavorable PFS (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Photopenic gliomas in negative FET PET scans should be managed more actively, as they seem to have a higher risk of harboring a higher-grade glioma and an unfavorable outcome.

Title: Tc-99m Glucoheptonate Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography-Computed Tomography for Detection of Recurrent Glioma: A Prospective Comparison with N-13 Ammonia Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess the efficacies of Tc-99m glucoheptonate single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (Tc-99m GHA SPECT-CT) and N-13 ammonia positron emission tomography-computed tomography (N-13 NH(3) PET-CT) in detecting recurrent glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive, histologically proven, and previously treated glioma patients (age, 38.9 +/- 12.2 years; 61.8% males) presenting with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated with Tc-99m GHA SPECT-CT and N-13 NH(3) PET-CT. Images were evaluated both qualitatively and semiquantitatively. A combination of clinicoradiological follow-up, repeat imaging, and/or biopsy (when available) was considered as the reference standard. RESULTS: Based on the reference standard, 28/55 (50.9%) patients had recurrence. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy of Tc-99m GHA SPECT-CT, and N-13 NH(3) PET-CT were 85.7%, 85.2%, 85.7%, 85.2%, 85.5% and 78.6%, 88.9%, 88.0%, 80.0%, 83.6%, respectively (concordant findings in 46 patients). The performances of the two modalities were equivalent both in overall and subgroup McNemar analyses (P = 0.508, overall; P = 0.687, low grade; P = 1.000, high grade). CONCLUSION: Tc-99m GHA SPECT-CT is an alternative imaging modality equally efficacious as N-13 NH(3) PET-CT in detecting recurrent glioma.

Title: Advanced MR imaging and (18)F-DOPA PET characteristics of H3K27M-mutant and wild-type pediatric diffuse midline gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate MRI-derived diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), (1)H-MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging in comparison with (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) PET with respect to diagnostic evaluation of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) H3K27M-mutant and wild-type. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 22 pediatric patients with DMG histologically proved and molecularly classified as H3K27M-mutant (12 subjects) and wild-type (10 subjects) who underwent DWI, (1)H-MRS, and ASL performed within 2 weeks of (18)F-DOPA PET. DWI-derived relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC min), (1)H-MRS data [choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA), choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), and presence of lactate] and relative ASL-derived cerebral blood flow max (rCBF max) were compared with (18)F-DOPA uptake Tumor/Normal tissue (T/N) and Tumor/Striatum (T/S) ratios, and correlated with histological and molecular features of DMG. Statistics included Pearson's chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman's rank correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The highest degrees of correlation among different techniques were found between T/S, rADC min and Cho/NAA ratio (p < 0.01), and between rCBF max and rADC min (p < 0.01). Significant differences between histologically classified low- and high-grade DMG, independently of H3K27M-mutation, were found among all imaging techniques (p </= 0.02). Significant differences in terms of rCBF max, rADC min, Cho/NAA and (18)F-DOPA uptake were also found between molecularly classified mutant and wild-type DMG (p </= 0.02), even though wild-type DMG included low-grade astrocytomas, not present among mutant DMG. When comparing only histologically defined high-grade mutant and wild-type DMG, only the (18)F-DOPA PET data T/S demonstrated statistically significant differences independently of histology (p < 0.003). ROC analysis demonstrated that T/S ratio was the best parameter for differentiating mutant from wild-type DMG (AUC 0.94, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced MRI and (18)F-DOPA PET characteristics of DMG depend on histological features; however, (18)F-DOPA PET-T/S was the only parameter able to discriminate H3K27M-mutant from wild-type DMG independently of histology.

Title: Dose-painted volumetric modulated arc therapy of high-grade glioma using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine positron emission tomography.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dose painting with volumetric modulated arc therapy for high-grade gliomas using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) could achieve dose-escalated coverage of biological target volumes (BTVs) without increasing the dose to cranial organs at risk (OARs). METHODS: 10 patients with high-grade gliomas underwent CT, MRI, and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT images for post-operative radiation therapy planning. Two volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were retrospectively generated for each patient: a conventional plan with 60 Gy in 30 fractions to the planning target volume delineated on MRI and a dose-escalated plan with a maximum dose of 80 Gy in 30 fractions to BTVs. BTVs were created by thresholding (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT uptake using a linear quadratic model that assumed tracer uptake was linearly related to tumour cell density. The maximum doses and equivalent uniform doses of OARs were compared. RESULTS: The median volume of the planning target volume receiving at least 95% of the prescribed dose (V (95%)) was 99.6% with and 99.5% without dose painting. The median V (95%) was >99.2% for BTVs. The maximum doses and equivalent uniform doses to the OARs did not differ significantly between the conventional and dose-painted plans. CONCLUSION: Using commercially available treatment planning software, dose painting for high-grade gliomas was feasible with good BTV coverage and no significant change in the dose to OARs. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: A novel treatment planning strategy was used to achieve dose painting for gliomas with BTVs obtained from (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT using a radiobiological model.

Title: Usefulness of [(11)C] Methionine PET in the Differentiation of Tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis from High Grade Astrocytoma.
Abstract: Tumefactive multiple sclerosis (tumefactive MS) is an atypical variant of MS characterized by a large isolated demyelinating lesion. Because tumefactive MS mimics high grade astrocytoma clinically and radiologically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two using only traditional diagnostic modalities, such as routine magnetic resonance imaging. [(11)C] methionine positron emission tomography (MET PET) has been known as a useful diagnostic tool for glioma. However, it has not been established as a diagnostic tool for tumefactive MS yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of MET PET in differentiating tumefactive MS from high grade astrocytoma. We studied patients with tumefactive MS [six patients (three men, three women), 7 lesions] and 77 patients with astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade II: 13 patients, grade III: 28 patients, and grade IV: 36 patients), and we compared MET uptake of tumefactive demyelinating lesions and astrocytoma. For MET PET analysis, Lesion/Normal region ratios (L/N ratios) were calculated and compared between tumefactive demyelinating lesions and astrocytoma. On MET PET, the L mean/N ratio of tumefactive MS was 1.18 +/- 0.50, which was significantly lower than that of high-grade glioma (astrocytoma grade III: 1.95 +/- 0.62, P = 0.006; grade IV: 2.35 +/- 0.54, P <0.0001). The L maximum (L max)/N ratio of tumefactive demyelinating lesion was also significantly lower than that of high grade astrocytoma (tumefactive MS: 1.89 +/- 0.55; astrocytoma grade III: 3.37 +/- 1.36, P = 0.0232; astrocytoma grade IV: 4.35 +/- 1.30, P <0.0001). In conclusion, MET PET can help differentiate tumefactive MS from high grade astrocytoma.

Title: Comparison of [(18)F]Fluoroethyltyrosine PET and Sodium MRI in Cerebral Gliomas: a Pilot Study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) improves the diagnostics of cerebral gliomas compared with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sodium MRI is an evolving method to assess tumor metabolism. In this pilot study, we explored the relationship of [(18)F]FET-PET and sodium MRI in patients with cerebral gliomas in relation to the mutational status of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). PROCEDURES: Ten patients with untreated cerebral gliomas and one patient with a recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) were investigated by dynamic [(18)F]FET-PET and sodium MRI using an enhanced simultaneous single-quantum- and triple-quantum-filtered imaging of (23)Na (SISTINA) sequence to estimate total (NaT), weighted non-restricted (NaNR, mainly extracellular), and restricted (NaR, mainly intracellular) sodium in tumors and normal brain tissue. [(18)F]FET uptake and sodium parameters in tumors with a different IDH mutational status were compared. After biopsy or resection, histology and the IDH mutational status were determined neuropathologically. RESULTS: NaT (p = 0.05), tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR) of NaT (p = 0.02), NaNR (p = 0.003), and the ratio of NaT/NaR (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in IDH-mutated than in IDH-wild-type gliomas (n = 5 patients each) while NaR was significantly lower in IDH-mutated gliomas (p = 0.01). [(18)F]FET parameters (TBR, time-to-peak) were not predictive of IDH status in this small cohort of patients. There was no obvious relationship between sodium distribution and [(18)F]FET uptake. The patient with a recurrent GBM exhibited an additional radiation injury with strong abnormalities in sodium MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium MRI appears to be more strongly related to the IDH mutational status than are [(18)F]FET-PET parameters. A further evaluation of the combination of the two methods in a larger group of high- and low-grade gliomas seems promising.

Title: Comparison of L-Methyl-11C-Methionine PET With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Detecting Newly Diagnosed Glioma.
Abstract: AIMS: Amino acid PET and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are at the forefront of noninvasive imaging techniques used for detection and subtyping of glioma-suspicious lesions. In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopathologic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion subgroups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. RESULTS: Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma patients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker distribution showed no clear trend. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed TBRmax to be the best performing parameter in identifying IDH status (area under the curve, 0.67) and all spectroscopy markers combined in identifying glioma subgroups (area under the curve, 0.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-Methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS bear limited potential in glioma subgrouping. L-Methyl-C-methionine PET appears to be superior in differentiating IDH status, whereas MRS is more helpful in glioma subgrouping.

Title: Prognostic Value of O-(2-[(18)F]Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine PET/CT in Newly Diagnosed WHO 2016 Grade II and III Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The use of [(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has proven valuable in brain tumor management. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of radiotracer uptake in newly diagnosed grade II or III gliomas according to the current 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. PROCEDURES: A total of 35 treatment-naive patients (mean age, 48 +/- 17 years) with histologically proven WHO grade II or III gliomas as defined by the current 2016 WHO classification were included. Static PET/CT imaging was performed 20 min after intravenous [(18)F]FET injection. Images were assessed visually and semi-quantitatively using regions of interest for both tumor (SUVmax, SUVmean) and background (BKGmean) to calculate tumor-to-background (TBR) ratios. The association among histological results, molecular markers (including isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status), clinical features (age), and PET findings was tested and compared with outcome (progression-free [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). RESULTS: Fourteen patients presented with grade II (diffuse astrocytoma n = 10, oligodendroglioma n = 4) and 21 patients with grade III glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma n = 15, anaplastic oligodendroglioma n = 6). Twenty-seven out of the 35 patients were PET-positive (grade II n = 8/14, grade III n = 19/21), with grade III tumors exhibiting significantly higher amino acid uptake (TBR(mean) and TBR(max); p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). PET-negative lesions demonstrated significantly prolonged PFS (p = 0.003) as compared to PET-positive gliomas. PET-positive disease had a complementary value in prognostication in addition to patient age, glioma grade, and molecular markers. CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid uptake as assessed by [(18)F]FET-PET/CT imaging is useful as non-invasive read-out for tumor biology and prognosis in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive gliomas according to the 2016 WHO classification.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of (13)N-ammonia PET, (11)C-methionine PET and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET: a comparative study in patients with suspected cerebral glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with glioma depended on the nature of the lesion and on histological grade of the tumor. Positron emission tomography (PET) using (13)N-ammonia (NH(3)), (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have been used to assess brain tumors. Our aim was to compare their diagnostic accuracies in patients with suspected cerebral glioma. METHODS: Ninety patients with suspicion of glioma based on previous CT/MRI, who underwent NH(3) PET, MET PET and FDG PET, were prospectively enrolled in the study. The reference standard was established by histology or clinical and radiological follow-up. Images were interpreted by visual evaluation and semi-quantitative analysis using the lesion-to-normal white matter uptake ratio (L/WM ratio). RESULTS: Finally, 30 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 27 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 10 non-glioma tumors and 23 non-neoplastic lesions (NNL) were diagnosed. On visual evaluation, sensitivity and specificity for differentiating tumors from NNL were 62.7% (42/67) and 95.7% (22/23) for NH(3) PET, 94.0% (63/67) and 56.5% (13/23) for MET PET, and 35.8% (24/67) and 65.2% (15/23) for FDG PET. On semi-quantitative analysis, brain tumors showed significantly higher L/WM ratios than NNL both in NH(3) and MET PET (both P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, respectively, were 64.2, 100% and 0.819 for NH(3); and 89.6, 69.6% and 0.840 for MET. Besides, the L/WM ratios of NH(3), MET and FDG PET in HGG all significantly higher than that in LGG (all P < 0.001). The predicted (by ROC) accuracy of the tracers (AUC shown in parentheses) were 86.0% (0.896) for NH(3), 87.7% (0.928) for MET and 93.0% (0.964) for FDG. While no significant differences in the AUC were seen between them. CONCLUSION: NH(3) PET has remarkably high specificity for the differentiation of brain tumors from NNL, but low sensitivity for the detection of LGG. MET PET was found to be highly useful for detection of brain tumors. However, like FDG, high MET uptake is frequently observed in some NNL. NH(3), MET and FDG PET all appears to be valuable for evaluating the histological grade of gliomas.

Title: Ictal FDGPET and SPECT in hemifacial seizures due to cerebellar epilepsy-Case report.
Abstract: The role of cerebellum in seizure generation is debatable. Semiology and electroencephalography (EEG) findings are non-specific and sometimes misleading, posing further difficulty in proving the epileptogenicity in pre-surgical workup. We report two cases of cerebellar lesions who presented with hemifacial seizures since the neonatal period and were refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Both inter-ictal and ictal EEGs were non-contributory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lesion in the cerebellum, in proximity to cerebellar peduncle in both the patients. (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed focal hypermetabolism and hyperperfusion respectively, corresponding to the lesion on MRI in both the cases. Intraoperative electrocorticography showed rhythmic spikes confirming the epileptogenic nature of the lesion. Both patients were operated with a favorable surgical outcome. Histopathology was suggestive of a ganglioglioma in one child and a low-grade glioma in the other. Both cases illustrate that FDG-PET and SPECT can act as surrogate markers for invasive recordings to prove the epileptogenicity of cerebellar lesions, especially in resource limited settings.

Title: Immunohistochemical Characterization of Procaspase-3 Overexpression as a Druggable Target With PAC-1, a Procaspase-3 Activator, in Canine and Human Brain Cancers.
Abstract: Gliomas and meningiomas are the most common brain neoplasms affecting both humans and canines, and identifying druggable targets conserved across multiple brain cancer histologies and comparative species could broadly improve treatment outcomes. While satisfactory cure rates for low grade, non-invasive brain cancers are achievable with conventional therapies including surgery and radiation, the management of non-resectable or recurrent brain tumors remains problematic and necessitates the discovery of novel therapies that could be accelerated through a comparative approach, such as the inclusion of pet dogs with naturally-occurring brain cancers. Evidence supports procaspase-3 as a druggable brain cancer target with PAC-1, a pro-apoptotic, small molecule activator of procaspase-3 that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Procaspase-3 is frequently overexpressed in malignantly transformed tissues and provides a preferential target for inducing cancer cell apoptosis. While preliminary evidence supports procaspase-3 as a viable target in preclinical models, with PAC-1 demonstrating activity in rodent models and dogs with spontaneous brain tumors, the broader applicability of procaspase-3 as a target in human brain cancers, as well as the comparability of procaspase-3 expressions between differing species, requires further investigation. As such, a large-scale validation of procaspase-3 as a druggable target was undertaken across 651 human and canine brain tumors. Relative to normal brain tissues, procaspase-3 was overexpressed in histologically diverse cancerous brain tissues, supporting procaspase-3 as a broad and conserved therapeutic target. Additionally, procaspase-3 expressing glioma and meningioma cell lines were sensitive to the apoptotic effects of PAC-1 at biologically relevant exposures achievable in cancer patients. Importantly, the clinical relevance of procaspase-3 as a potential prognostic variable was demonstrated in human astrocytomas of variable histologic grades and associated clinical outcomes, whereby tumoral procaspase-3 expression was negatively correlated with survival; findings which suggest that PAC-1 might provide the greatest benefit for patients with the most guarded prognoses.

Title: Differential Uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (PSMA-11) in Low-Grade Versus High-Grade Gliomas in Treatment-Naive Patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II membrane glycoprotein, which is not only overexpressed in prostate cancers but also in variety of solid tumors including glioblastoma multiforme. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate PSMA expression in gliomas using Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC(PSMA 11) PET/CT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with initially MRI suspected and eventually histopathologically proven gliomas [8 males (age range 30-73 yr; mean age 51.8 yr); 2 females aged 39 and 55 years] were subjected preoperatively to regional brain PET scan with Ga-PSMA-11 and F-FDG PET/CT. Final histopathology of brain lesions, their MIB-1 proliferation index (MIB-1 PI) were compared with PSMA and FDG PET findings. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT showed distinct FDG uptake in high-grade gliomas, whereas low-grade gliomas were non-FDG-avid amidst physiological tracer uptake. In vivo PSMA expression was seen in all patients with glioma. Of these, the 7 patients of glioblastoma harboring 8 lesions showed significantly higher PSMA expression than those with low-grade gliomas, average SUVmax being 16.93 and 2.93, respectively. Similarly, average tumor-to-background ratios (13.95 and 3.42, respectively) and MIB-1 PI (17.31 and 3.3, respectively) were substantially more in high-grade versus low-grade gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study show that Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT can be used to characterize the PSMA expression in gliomas, high-grade ones demonstrating higher SUVmax, MIB-1 PI tumor-to-background ratio than the low-grade ones. With these results as basis, certain patients may benefit from potential PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy.

Title: Comparison of dual-time point 18F-FDG PET/CT tumor-to-background ratio, intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence scale, and Ki-67 index in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare preoperative dual-time point F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake pattern with intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence in high-grade gliomas. In addition, we assessed for possible associations with a pathologic parameter (Ki-67 index).Thirty-one patients with high-grade glioma (M:F = 19:12, mean age = 60.6 +/- 11.2 years) who underwent dual-time point F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan before surgery were retrospectively enrolled; 5-ALA was applied to the surgical field of all these patients and its fluorescence intensity was evaluated during surgery. Measured F-FDG PET/CT parameters were maximum and peak tumor-to-background ratio (maxTBR and peakTBR) at base (-base) and delayed (-delay) scan. The intensity of 5-ALA fluorescence was graded on a scale of three (grade I as no or mild intensity, grade II as moderate intensity, and grade III as strong intensity).Seven of the patients had WHO grade III brain tumors and 24 had WHO grade IV tumors (mean tumor size = 4.8 +/- 1.8 cm). MaxTBR-delay and peakTBR-delay showed significantly higher values than maxTBR-base and peakTBR-base, respectively (all P < .001). Among the F-FDG PET/CT parameters, only maxTBR-delay demonstrated significance according to grade of 5-ALA (P = .030), and maxTBR-delay gradually decreased as the fluorescence intensity increased. Also, maxTBR-delay and peakTBR-delay showed significant positive correlation with Ki-67 index (P = .011 and .009, respectively).Delayed F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images could reflect proliferation in high-grade glioma, and it has a complementary role with 5-ALA fluorescence.

Title: Integrated PET-MRI for Glioma Surveillance: Perfusion-Metabolism Discordance Rate and Association With Molecular Profiling.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Both (18)F-FDG PET and perfusion MRI are commonly used techniques for posttreatment glioma surveillance. Using integrated PET-MRI, we assessed the rate of discordance between simultaneously acquired FDG PET images and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MR images and determined whether tumor genetics predicts discordance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with high-grade gliomas (20 with grade IV gliomas and 21 with grade III gliomas) underwent a standardized tumor protocol performed using an integrated 3-T PET-MRI scanner. Quantitative measures of standardized uptake value, plasma volume, and permeability were obtained from segmented whole-tumor volumes of interest and targeted ROIs. ROC curve analysis and the Youden index were used to identify optimal cutoffs for FDG PET and DCE-MRI. Two-by-two contingency tables and percent agreement were used to assess accuracy and concordance. Twenty-six patients (63%) from the cohort underwent next-generation sequencing for tumor genetics. RESULTS: The best-performing FDG PET and DCE-MRI cutoffs achieved sensitivities of 94% and 91%, respectively; specificities of 56% and 89%, respectively; and accuracies of 80% and 83%, respectively. FDG PET and DCE-MRI findings were discordant for 11 patients (27%), with DCE-MRI findings correct for six of these patients (55%). Tumor grade, tumor volume, bevacizumab exposure, and time since radiation predicted discordance between FDG PET and DCE-MRI findings, with an ROC AUC value of 0.78. Isocitrate dehydrogenase gene and receptor tyrosine kinase gene pathway mutations increased the ROC AUC value to 0.83. CONCLUSION: FDG PET and DCE-MRI show comparable accuracy and sensitivity in identifying tumor progression. These modalities were shown to have discordant findings for more than a quarter of the patients assessed. Tumor genetics may contribute to perfusion-metabolism discordance, warranting further investigation.

Title: High-resolution metabolic mapping of gliomas via patch-based super-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 7T.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of 7 T magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), combined with patch-based super-resolution (PBSR) reconstruction, for high-resolution multi-metabolite mapping of gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas (6/4, male/female; 45 +/- 9 years old) were prospectively measured between 2014 and 2018 on a 7 T whole-body MR imager after routine 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Free induction decay MRSI with a 64 x 64-matrix and a nominal voxel size of 3.4 x 3.4 x 8 mm(3) was acquired in six minutes, along with standard T1/T2-weighted MRI. Metabolic maps were obtained via spectral LCmodel processing and reconstructed to 0.9 x 0.9 x 8 mm(3) resolutions via PBSR. RESULTS: Metabolite maps obtained from combined 7 T MRSI and PBSR resolved the density of metabolic activity in the gliomas in unprecedented detail. Particularly in the more heterogeneous cases (e.g. post resection), metabolite maps enabled the identification of complex metabolic activities, which were in topographic agreement with PET enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: PBSR-MRSI combines the benefits of ultra-high-field MR systems, cutting-edge MRSI, and advanced postprocessing to allow millimetric resolution molecular imaging of glioma tissue beyond standard methods. An ideal example is the accurate imaging of glutamine, which is a prime target of modern therapeutic approaches, made possible due to the higher spectral resolution of 7 T systems.

Title: Recent developments and future directions in adult lower-grade gliomas: Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) consensus.
Abstract: The finding that most grades II and III gliomas harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations conveying a relatively favorable and fairly similar prognosis in both tumor grades highlights that these tumors represent a fundamentally different entity from IDH wild-type gliomas exemplified in most glioblastoma. Herein we review the most recent developments in molecular neuropathology leading to reclassification of these tumors based upon IDH and 1p/19q status, as well as the potential roles of methylation profiling and deletional analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A and 2B. We discuss the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, benefit of surgical resection, and neuroimaging features of lower-grade gliomas as they relate to molecular subtype, including advanced imaging techniques such as 2-hydroxyglutarate magnetic resonance spectroscopy and amino acid PET scanning. Recent, ongoing, and planned studies of radiation therapy and both cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapies are summarized, including both small molecule and immunotherapy approaches specifically targeting the mutant IDH protein.

Title: L-[Methyl-(11)C] Methionine-Positron-Emission Tomography (MET-PET).
Abstract: Methionine (MET) dependence is a cancer-specific metabolic abnormality that is due to MET overuse for aberrant transmethylation reactions. [(11)C]-MET is very useful for positron-emission tomography (PET) due to MET overuse in malignant tumors. Many benefits of MET-PET have been demonstrated. MET-PET can differentiate recurrent glioma and necrosis. [(11)C]-MET-PET can also predict prognosis in gliomas better than [(18)F]-FDG PET. [(11)C]-MET-PET is better than MRI for predicting survival in low-grade glioma (LGG). MET-PET has greater specificity for detecting residual tumor after surgery than MRI.

Title: Combined Amino Acid Positron Emission Tomography and Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide valuable information about brain tumor patients. Particularly amino acid PET, advanced MRI techniques, and combinations thereof are of great interest for the non-invasive assessment of biological characteristics in patients with primary or secondary brain cancer. A methodological innovation that potentially advances research in patients with brain tumors is the increasing availability of hybrid PET/MRI systems, which enables the simultaneous acquisition of both imaging modalities. Furthermore, the advent of ultra-high field MRI scanners operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 T or more will allow further development of metabolic MR imaging at higher resolution. This review focuses on the combination of amino acid PET with MR spectroscopic imaging, perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging, as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer in patients with high-grade gliomas, especially glioblastomas.

Title: Pattern of FDG and MET Distribution in High- and Low-Grade Gliomas on PET Images.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: This study aimed to determine the most effective metabolic index of FDG-PET and MET-PET to differentiate high- and low-grade gliomas, and then to characterize tumor metabolism according to the 2016 WHO classification. We also developed a new calculation method of potential infiltrative tumor volume to overcome the current limitations of tumor evaluation according to metabolic index, which focuses solely on tumor core area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent both FDG-PET and MET-PET, as well as surgical treatment, were retrospectively identified. All tumors were diagnosed histologically and included 44 high-grade and 19 low-grade gliomas. Metabolic indices of tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio and maximum value within the tumor itself were compared between high- and low-grade tumors. A calculation method for potential infiltrative tumor volume was developed and compared between these 2 grades. RESULTS: T/N, calculated as tumor value divided by normal cortex value, was the most effective (area under the curve, 0.800 for FDG-PET; area under the curve, 0.773 for MET-PET) for differentiating high- and low-grade gliomas. Potential infiltrative volume effectively distinguished between high- and low-grade glioma (43.8 +/- 30.2 mL vs 14.0 +/- 12.6 mL; P = 0.005 [t test]). A combination of T/N, with a cutoff value of 0.9 or higher on FDG-PET and/or 3.0 or higher on MET-PET, and potential infiltrative volume, with a cutoff value of 20.0 mL or higher, provided a diagnostic accuracy of 89% in distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of potential infiltrative volume surrounding the tumor core area, in addition to the T/N ratio of the tumor core, may help distinguish between high- and low-grade gliomas.

Title: (18)F-Branched-Chain Amino Acids: Structure-Activity Relationships and PET Imaging Potential.
Abstract: The large, neutral L-type amino acid transporters (LAT1-LAT4) are sodium-independent transporters that are widely distributed throughout the body. LAT expression levels are increased in many types of cancer, and their expression increases as cancers progress, leading to high expression levels in high-grade tumors and metastases. Because of the key role and overexpression of LAT in many types of cancer, radiolabeled LAT substrates are promising candidates for nuclear imaging of malignancies that are not well revealed by conventional radiotracers. The goal of this study was to examine the structure-activity relationships of a series of (18)F-labeled amino acids that were predicted to be substrates of the LAT transport system. Methods: Using a photocatalytic radical fluorination, we prepared a series of 11 fluorinated branched-chain amino acids and evaluated them and their nonfluorinated parents in a cell-based LAT affinity assay. We radiofluorinated selected branched-chain amino acids via the same radical fluorination reaction and evaluated tumor uptake in U-87 glioma xenograft-bearing mice. Results: Structure-activity relationship trends observed in a LAT affinity assay were maintained in further in vitro studies, as well as in vivo using a U-87 xenograft model. LAT1 uptake was tolerant of fluorinated amino acid stereochemistry and chain length. PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed that the tracer (S)-5-(18)F-fluorohomoleucine had rapid tumor uptake, favorable in vivo kinetics, and good stability. Conclusion: By using an in vitro affinity assay, we could predict LAT-mediated cancer cell uptake in a panel of fluorinated amino acids. These predictions were consistent when applied to different cell lines and murine tumor models, and several new tracers may be suitable for further development as oncologic PET imaging agents.

Title: Treatment Combining CD200 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor and Tumor-Lysate Vaccination after Surgery for Pet Dogs with High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: Recent advances in immunotherapy have included inhibition of immune checkpoint proteins in the tumor microenvironment and tumor lysate-based vaccination strategies. We combined these approaches in pet dogs with high-grade glioma. Administration of a synthetic peptide targeting the immune checkpoint protein, CD200, enhanced the capacity of antigen-presenting cells to prime T-cells to mediate an anti-glioma response. We found that in canine spontaneous gliomas, local injection of a canine-specific, CD200-directed peptide before subcutaneous delivery of an autologous tumor lysate vaccine prolonged survival relative to a historical control treated with autologous tumor lysate alone (median survivals of 12.7 months and 6.36 months, respectively). Antigen-presenting cells and T-lymphocytes primed with this peptide suppressed their expression of the inhibitory CD200 receptor, thereby enhancing their ability to initiate immune reactions in a glioblastoma microenvironment replete with the immunosuppressive CD200 protein. These results support consideration of a CD200 ligand as a novel glioblastoma immunotherapeutic agent.

Title: Comparison Between 18F-Dopa and 18F-Fet PET/CT in Patients with Suspicious Recurrent High Grade Glioma: A Literature Review and Our Experience.
Abstract: PURPOSES: The aims of the present study were to: 1- critically assess the utility of L-3,4- dihydroxy-6-18Ffluoro-phenyl-alanine (18F-DOPA) and O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) in patients with high grade glioma (HGG) and 2- describe the results of 18F-DOPA and 18F-FET PET/CT in a case series of patients with recurrent HGG. METHODS: We searched for studies using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. The search terms were: glioma OR brain neoplasm and DOPA OR DOPA PET OR DOPA PET/CT and FET OR FET PET OR FET PET/CT. From a mono-institutional database, we retrospectively analyzed the 18F-DOPA and 18F-FET PET/CT of 29 patients (age: 56 +/- 12 years) with suspicious for recurrent HGG. All patients underwent 18F-DOPA or 18F-FET PET/CT for a multidisciplinary decision. The final definition of recurrence was made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or multidisciplinary decision, mainly based on the clinical data. RESULTS: Fifty-one articles were found, of which 49 were discarded, therefore 2 studies were finally selected. In both the studies, 18F-DOPA and 18F-FET as exchangeable in clinical practice particularly for HGG patients. From our institutional experience, in 29 patients, we found that sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-DOPA PET/CT in HGG were 100% (95% confidence interval- 95%CI - 81-100%), 63% (95%CI: 39-82%) and 62% (95%CI: 39-81%), respectively. 18F-FET PET/CT was true positive in 4 and true negative in 4 patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for 18F-FET PET/CT in HGG were 100%. CONCLUSION: 18F-DOPA and 18F-FET PET/CT have a similar diagnostic accuracy in patients with recurrent HGG. However, 18F-DOPA PET/CT could be affected by inflammation conditions (false positive) that can alter the final results. Large comparative trials are warranted in order to better understand the utility of 18F-DOPA or 18F-FET PET/CT in patients with HGG.

Title: (18)F-DOPA uptake does not correlate with IDH mutation status and 1p/19q co-deletion in glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The role of amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) in glioma grading and outcome prognostication has not yet been well established. This is particularly true in the context of the new WHO 2016 classification, which introduced a definition of glioma subtypes primarily based on molecular fingerprints. The aim of the present study was to correlate 3,4‑dihydroxy‑6‑[(18)F]‑fluoro-L‑phenylalanine (F-DOPA) uptake parameters with IDH mutation, 1p/19q status, and survival outcomes in patients with glioma. METHODS: The study population consisted of 33 patients (17 M/16 F, mean age: 46 +/- 13 years) who underwent F-DOPA PET/CT for the evaluation of tumor extent before the start of chemo or radiotherapy. The presence of IDH mutation and 1p/19q status was assessed in all the cases. Tumor volume and semiquantitative uptake parameters, namely SUV(max), tumor-to-normal brain ratio and tumor-to-normal striatum ratio, were calculated for each tumor. Imaging-derived parameters were compared between patients stratified according to molecular fingerprints, using parametric or non-parametric tests, where appropriate. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess differences of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between groups. PET parameters were also tested as prognostic factors in univariate Cox survival regression models. RESULTS: There were 12 IDH-wild-type and 21 IDH-mutant patients. Stratification according to 1p/19q co-deletion resulted in 20 non-co-deleted and 13 co-deleted patients. Median follow-up time from PET/CT exam was 30.5 months (range 3.5-74 months). Semiquantitative uptake parameters did correlate neither with IDH mutation nor with 1p/19q status. Uptake was similar in low-grade and high-grade tumors, respectively. In addition, F-DOPA uptake parameters, macroscopic tumor volume, or tumor grade did not stratify OS, while a correlation between SUV(max) and PFS was shown in the subgroup of astrocytomas. On the other hand, IDH mutation status and presence of 1p/19q co-deletion had a significant impact on survival outcomes. The prognostic value of IDH mutation status was also confirmed in the subgroup of patients with astrocytic tumors. CONCLUSIONS: F-DOPA uptake parameters do not correlate with tumor molecular and histological characteristics. The predictive value of PET-derived parameters on outcomes of survival is limited.

Title: Ischemic Complications After High-Grade Glioma Resection Could Interfere With Residual Tumor Detection With 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT.
Abstract: Ischemic complications after resection of high-grade glioma are frequent and may constitute potential cause of false-positive results in postsurgical evaluation using F-fluorocholine PET/CT. On the other hand, hypoxia caused by ischemia promotes invasive glioma growth. We present 3 cases of patients with different grades of ischemic injury after resection of high-grade glioma. The combined interpretation of diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map on MRI, in this clinical setting, is mandatory to avoid PET/CT misinterpretations.

Title: Hybrid 11C-MET PET/MRI Combined With "Machine Learning" in Glioma Diagnosis According to the Revised Glioma WHO Classification 2016.
Abstract: PURPOSE: With the advent of the revised WHO classification from 2016, molecular features, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation have become important in glioma subtyping. This pilot trial analyzed the potential for C-methionine (MET) PET/MRI in classifying glioma according to the revised WHO classification using a machine learning model. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed WHO grade II-IV glioma underwent preoperative MET-PET/MRI imaging. Patients were retrospectively divided into four groups: IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GBM), IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (GII/III-IDHwt), IDH mutant grade II/III glioma with codeletion of 1p19q (GII/III-IDHmut1p19qcod) or without 1p19q-codeletion (GII/III-IDHmut1p19qnc). Within each group, the maximum tumor-to-brain-ratio (TBRmax) of MET-uptake was calculated. To gain generalizable implications from our data, we made use of a machine learning algorithm based on a development and validation subcohort. A support vector machine model was fit to the development subcohort and evaluated on the validation subcohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis served as metric to assess model performance. RESULTS: Of a total of 259 patients, 39 patients met the inclusion criteria. TBRmax was highest in the GBM cohort (TBRmax 3.83 +/- 1.30) and significantly higher (P = 0.004) compared to GII/III-IDHmut1p19qnc group, where TBRmax was lowest (TBRmax 2.05 +/- 0.94). ROC analysis showed poor AUC for glioma subtyping (AUC 0.62) and high AUC of 0.79 for predicting IDH status. In the GII/III-IDHmut1p19qcod group, TBR values were slightly higher than in the IDHmut1p19qnc group. CONCLUSIONS: MET-PET/MRI imaging in pre-operatively classifying glioma entities appears useful for the assessment of IDH status. However, a larger trial is needed prior to translation into the clinical routine.

Title: Targeting iron metabolism in high-grade glioma with 68Ga-citrate PET/MR.
Abstract: Noninvasive tools that target tumor cells could improve the management of glioma. Cancer generally has a high demand for Fe(III), an essential nutrient for a variety of biochemical processes. We tested whether 68Ga-citrate, an Fe(III) biomimetic that binds to apo-transferrin in blood, detects glioma in preclinical models and patients using hybrid PET/MRI. Mouse PET/CT studies showed that 68Ga-citrate accumulates in subcutaneous U87MG xenografts in a transferrin receptor-dependent fashion within 4 hours after injection. Seventeen patients with WHO grade III or IV glioma received 3.7-10.2 mCi 68Ga-citrate and were imaged with PET/MR 123-307 minutes after injection to establish that the radiotracer can localize to human tumors. Multiple contrast-enhancing lesions were PET avid, and tumor to adjacent normal white matter ratios were consistently greater than 10:1. Several contrast-enhancing lesions were not PET avid. One minimally enhancing lesion and another tumor with significantly reduced enhancement following bevacizumab therapy were PET avid. Advanced MR imaging analysis of one patient with contrast-enhancing glioblastoma showed that metabolic hallmarks of viable tumor spatially overlaid with 68Ga-citrate accumulation. These early data underscore that high-grade glioma may be detectable with a radiotracer that targets Fe(III) transport.

Title: Characterization of Diffuse Gliomas With Histone H3-G34 Mutation by MRI and Dynamic 18F-FET PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that diffuse gliomas carrying mutations in codon 34 of the H3 histone family 3A protein represent a very rare, distinct subgroup of IDH-wild type malignant astrocytic gliomas. However, characteristics detectable by MRI and F-FET PET in H3-G34-mutant gliomas are unknown. METHODS: We report on MRI and F-FET PET findings in 8 patients from 4 German centers with H3-G34-mutant diffuse gliomas. MRI analyses included multifocality, contrast enhancement, necrosis, cysts, hemorrhages, calcification, and edema. F-FET PET characteristics were evaluated on the basis of static F-FET PET parameters, such as maximal tumor-to-background ratio (TBRmax) and biological tumor volume (BTV), as well as the minimal time-to-peak (TTPmin) obtained from dynamic F-FET PET data. RESULTS: MRI showed multifocal lesions in 2 of 8, contrast enhancement in 6 of 8, necrosis in 3 of 8, cysts in 3 of 8, hemorrhage in 1 of 8, and calcifications in 1 of 8 patients. None of the tumors showed marked peritumoral edema. However, all 8 H3-G34-mutant gliomas were characterized by a high uptake intensity on F-FET PET with a median TBRmax of 3.4 (range, 2.5-11.7) and a relatively diffuse uptake pattern leading to a large BTV (median, 41.9 mL; range, 7.5-115.6). Dynamic PET data revealed a short median TTPmin of 12.5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: MRI features of diffuse gliomas with H3-G34 mutation may present very heterogeneously with some cases not even fulfilling the imaging criteria of high-grade glioma. In contrast, in F-FET PET, these tumors show an extensive and diffuse tracer uptake resulting in large BTV with a high TBRmax and a short TTPmin, thus resembling PET characteristics of aggressive high-grade gliomas, namely, glioblastomas.

Title: The role of (13)N-ammonia in the differential diagnosis of gliomas and brain inflammatory lesions.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of (13)N-ammonia PET/CT imaging in the differential diagnosis of gliomas and brain inflammations. METHODS: (13)N-ammonia PET/CT imaging data of 77 patients with gliomas and 34 patients with brain inflammations were retrospectively analyzed. No patients received any treatment before (13)N-ammonia imaging. All the patients were diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy or clinical follow-up. Visual and semi-quantitative analysis was performed to analyze the results of (13)N-ammonia imaging. Finally, the uptake ratios of each lesion were calculated and its differences among different groups were tested with one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: 29.4% inflammations, 51.6% low-grade gliomas and 91.3% high-grade gliomas were positive by visual analysis in (13)N-ammonia imaging. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the diagnosis of gliomas were 75.3%, 55.8% and 67.8%, respectively. As for semi-quantitative analysis, the T/G ratios of inflammatory lesions, low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas were 0.88 +/- 0.24, 1.04 +/- 0.43 and 1.43 +/- 0.49, respectively. One-way ANOVA revealed that the T/G ratios of high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than those of low-grade gliomas and inflammations (P < 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between low-grade gliomas and inflammations (P = 0.118). Among the inflammatory lesions, T/G ratios were not statistically different between infectious and demyelinating lesions (P > 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value of T/G ratio in distinguishing gliomas from inflammations was 1.21 with the AUC 0.78. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 52.9%, 94.4%, 65.3%, 95.7% and 45.9%, respectively. ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value of T/G ratio in distinguishing high-grade gliomas from low-grade gliomas was 1.06 with the AUC 0.78. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 81.5%, 67.7%, 76.5%, 81.5% and 67.7%, respectively. ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value of T/G ratio in distinguishing high-grade gliomas from low-grade gliomas and inflammations was 1.19 with the AUC 0.84. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 70.4%, 85.1%, 78.5%, 79.2% and 78.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: (13)N-ammonia imaging is effective in distinguishing high-grade gliomas from low-grade gliomas and inflammations, but its role in the differential diagnosis of low-grade gliomas and brain inflammatory lesions is limited, and the accuracy needs to be improved.

Title: Hypermetabolism Caused by Seizure Mimicking Tumor Recurrence.
Abstract: A 41-year-old man had a right frontal grade I glioma resection 17 years ago. He was tumor free since. However, 1 month ago, he presented with an uncontrollable seizure, which raised the possibility of recurrent tumor. The FDG PET/CT brain scan showed increased tracer uptake at the margin of the previous resected tumor, suggesting the possibility of tumor recurrence. However, on a repeat FDG PET brain scan confirmed by electroencephalography monitory as an interictal study, no elevated FDG uptake was revealed at this site. These results indicate that the elevated F-FDG activity on the original study was a result of seizure.

Title: Feasibility and robustness of dynamic (18)F-FET PET based tracer kinetic models applied to patients with recurrent high-grade glioma prior to carbon ion irradiation.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the robustness and diagnostic value of different compartment models for dynamic (18)F-FET PET in recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). Dynamic (18)F-FET PET data of patients with recurrent WHO grade III (n:7) and WHO grade IV (n: 9) tumors undergoing re-irradiation with carbon ions were analyzed by voxelwise fitting of the time-activity curves with a simplified and an extended one-tissue compartment model (1TCM) and a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), respectively. A simulation study was conducted to assess robustness and precision of the 2TCM. Parameter maps showed enhanced detail on tumor substructure. Neglecting the blood volume V(B) in the 1TCM yields insufficient results. Parameter K(1) from both 1TCM and 2TCM showed correlation with overall patient survival after carbon ion irradiation (p = 0.043 and 0.036, respectively). The 2TCM yields realistic estimates for tumor blood volume, which was found to be significantly higher in WHO IV compared to WHO III (p = 0.031). Simulations on the 2TCM showed that K(1) yields good accuracy and robustness while k(2) showed lowest stability of all parameters. The 1TCM provides the best compromise between parameter stability and model accuracy; however application of the 2TCM is still feasible and provides a more accurate representation of tracer-kinetics at the cost of reduced robustness. Detailed tracer kinetic analysis of (18)F-FET PET with compartment models holds valuable information on tumor substructures and provides additional diagnostic and prognostic value.

Title: Modified fractal analysis of methionine positron emission tomography images for predicting prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess intratumoural metabolic heterogeneity using modified fractal analysis and to determine its prognostic significance in patients with glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients with newly diagnosed glioma who underwent methionine PET-computed tomography between August 2012 and January 2017 were enrolled. The requirement for informed consent was waived for this retrospective study. Tumour-to-normal tissue ratio, metabolic tumour volume, total lesion methionine uptake and modified fractal dimension (m-FD) were calculated for each tumour using methionine PET-computed tomography. Associations between these indices and tumour grade and overall survival were analysed. RESULTS: Overall, eight patients had grade II, 20 had grade III and 29 had grade IV tumours. The tumour-to-normal tissue ratios of grade III and grade IV tumours were significantly greater than that of grade II tumours. The metabolic tumour volume and total lesion methionine uptake of grade III tumours were significantly greater than those of grade II and grade IV tumours. The m-FD of grade IV tumours was significantly greater than those of grade II and grade III tumours. A total of 47 patients were followed up, and their prognoses were evaluated. Only the m-FD was significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P<0.05). Multivariate analyses identified age (>58 years) (hazard ratio: 5.73; 95.0% confidence interval: 1.4-29.9; P=0.015) and the m-FD (>0.87) (hazard ratio: 4.80; 95.0% confidence interval: 1.12-32.9; P=0.033) as independent prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSION: Intratumoural metabolic heterogeneity is a useful imaging biomarker in patients with glioma.

Title: Uptake of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL in Cerebral Radionecrosis: Implications for Diagnostic Imaging of High-Grade Gliomas.
Abstract: Recent PET imaging of glioblastoma multiforme and other high-grade gliomas using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted small-molecule radiotracers suggests a role for these agents in diagnostic imaging of recurrent/residual tumor and that PSMA-targeted endoradiotherapies may provide a new approach to therapy for patients with these difficult-to-treat tumors. We present a case of cerebral radionecrosis demonstrating PSMA-targeted radiotracer uptake. Our findings may represent a potential pitfall and limitation to the diagnostic application of PSMA-targeted agents for high-grade gliomas.

Title: Comparison of (18)F-GE-180 and dynamic (18)F-FET PET in high grade glioma: a double-tracer pilot study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: PET represents a valuable tool for glioma imaging. In addition to amino acid tracers such as (18)F-FET, PET targeting the 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator-protein (TSPO) is of high interest for high-grade glioma (HGG) imaging due to its upregulation in HGG cells. (18)F-GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, has shown a high target-to-background contrast in HGG. Therefore, we intra-individually compared its uptake characteristics to dynamic (18)F-FET PET and contrast-enhanced MRI in patients with HGG. METHODS: Twenty HGG patients (nine IDH-wildtype, 11 IDH-mutant) at initial diagnosis (n = 8) or recurrence (n = 12) were consecutively included and underwent (18)F-GE-180 PET, dynamic (18)F-FET PET, and MRI. The maximal tumour-to-background ratios (TBR(max)) and biological tumour volumes (BTV) were evaluated in (18)F-GE-180 and (18)F-FET PET. Dynamic (18)F-FET PET analysis included the evaluation of minimal time-to-peak (TTP(min)). In MRI, the volume of contrast-enhancement was delineated (VOL(CE)). Volumes were spatially correlated using the Sorensen-Dice coefficient. RESULTS: The median TBR(max) tended to be higher in (18)F-GE-180 PET compared to (18)F-FET PET [4.58 (2.33-8.95) vs 3.89 (1.56-7.15); p = 0.062] in the overall group. In subgroup analyses, IDH-wildtype gliomas showed a significantly higher median TBR(max) in (18)F-GE-180 PET compared to (18)F-FET PET [5.45 (2.56-8.95) vs 4.06 (1.56-4.48); p = 0.008]; by contrast, no significant difference was observed in IDH-mutant gliomas [3.97 (2.33-6.81) vs 3.79 (2.01-7.15) p = 1.000]. Only 5/20 cases showed higher TBR(max) in (18)F-FET PET compared to (18)F-GE-180 PET, all of them being IDH-mutant gliomas. No parameter in (18)F-GE-180 PET correlated with TTP(min) (p > 0.05 each). There was a tendency towards higher median BTV(GE-180) [32.1 (0.4-236.0) ml] compared to BTV(FET) [19.3 (0.7-150.2) ml; p = 0.062] with a moderate spatial overlap [median Sorensen-Dice coefficient 0.55 (0.07-0.85)]. In MRI, median VOL(CE) [9.7 (0.1-72.5) ml] was significantly smaller than both BTV(FET) and BTV(GE180) (p < 0.001 each), leading to a poor spatial correlation with BTV(GE-180) [0.29 (0.01-0.48)] and BTV(FET) [0.38 (0.01-0.68)]. CONCLUSION: PET with (18)F-GE-180 and (18)F-FET provides differing imaging information in HGG dependent on the IDH-mutational status, with diverging spatial overlap and vast exceedance of contrast-enhancement in MRI. Combined PET imaging might reveal new insights regarding non-invasive characterization of tumour heterogeneity and might influence patients' management.

Title: FET PET in the evaluation of indeterminate brain lesions on MRI: Differentiating glioma from other non-neoplastic causes - A pilot study.
Abstract: We aimed to determine the utility of FET PET in the management of indeterminate CNS lesions found on MRI. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with FET PET at a single tertiary institution from 2011 to 2015. FET PET images were processed using usual methods and measurements taken including SUVmax, TBRmax, and analysis of dynamic series where available (Kipeak, Vdpeak, as well as tumor:background ratio for these variables). Correlation studies were performed using ANOVA between cohorts of high-grade histology, low-grade histology, and benign histology/stable on observation. Thirty-five patients were included, of whom 34 were suitable for analysis with median follow-up of 5 months. The positive predictive value of FET PET in this cohort was 83.3%. FET SUVmax differentiated between patients with high-grade (mean SUV 3.38, 95% CI 2.21-4.55), low-grade (1.88, 95% CI 1.33-2.43) and benign/observation (1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.71) cohorts (p = 0.0003). Similarly, tumour to brain ratio was significant (p < 0.0001). Kipeak distinguished between high grade and observation cohorts (p = 0.036), as did KiTBR (p = 0.025). Vd peak was not significantly different in these two cohorts (p = 0.057) but Vd TBR was (p = 0.041). In conclusion, FET PET demonstrated a high positive predictive value for glioma in patients with indeterminate brain lesions on MRI. The combination of negative FET and negative FDG PET scans may predict an indolent clinical course. Confirmatory trials are needed to establish the potential value of FET PET in guiding surgical management in this cohort.

Title: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy differentiates tumefactive demyelinating lesions from gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is often difficult to accurately differentiate tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs) from gliomas using MRI. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in differentiating TDLs from gliomas. METHODS: Cohort 1 included 6 patients with TDLs and 5 with gliomas (3 high-grade), as assessed using a 1.5T MR unit. Cohort 2 included 6 patients with TDLs and 17 patients with gliomas (8 high-grade), as assessed using a 3.0T MR unit. Single-voxel proton MRS was performed to compare the following metabolite area ratios: choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr, and Cho/NAA in both cohorts. Correlations between the target-to-normal-tissue ratio (TNR) obtained using methionine-positron emission tomography (MET-PET) and each MRS metabolite ratio were examined in a subset of cohort 2 (4 patients with TDLs and 11 with gliomas). RESULTS: Mean Cho/NAA ratio was significantly higher in gliomas than in TDLs or MS in cohort 1 (p < 0.05). Mean Cho/NAA ratio was significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in TDLs in both cohorts (p(s) < 0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, high-grade glioma rather than TDL was indicated when the Cho/NAA ratio was >1.72 (the area under the curve was 0.958, and the maximum sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 87%, respectively). A significant positive correlation was observed between Cho/NAA ratio and the MET-PET TNR (r(2 )= 0.35, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MRS effectively differentiates TDLs from high-grade gliomas. Therefore, the clinical use of MRS is likely to enhance patient outcomes.

Title: Naturally Occurring Canine Glioma as a Model for Novel Therapeutics.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current animal models of glioma are limited to small animal models, which are less predictive of treatment of human disease. Canines often develop gliomas de novo, but the natural history of the disease is not well described. OBJECTIVE: We provide data for naturally occurring canine gliomas; evaluating medical and surgical therapies. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of pet dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of glioma from MRI imaging that underwent surgery as part of the Canine Brain Tumor Clinical Trials Program. Breed, age, sex, median progression-free, and overall survival times and cause of death were recorded for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Ninety five dogs (56 male; mean age = 8.3 years) were included, but nine were excluded as final pathology was non-neoplastic. Gross total resection was reported in 81 cases based on postoperative MRI. Seventy had high-grade tumors (grade III or IV). Eighty three dogs presented with seizures, being the most common presenting clinical sign. Median survival after surgery was 723 days (95% CI 343-1103) for grade II tumors, 301 days (197-404) for grade III and 200 days (126-274) for grade IV (p = .009 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; Log Rank test). Age (cox regression, p = .14) or sex (Kaplan-Meier test, p = .22) did not predict survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes normative data for a model exploiting dogs with naturally occurring glioma, which can be used to test novel therapies prior to translation to human trials. Further work will focus on the effects of different therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

Title: Neurosarcoidosis Mimics High-Grade Glioma in Dynamic 18F-FET PET Due to LAT Expression.
Abstract: We present a 45-year-old man with newly generalized tonic-clonic seizures due to a contrast-enhancing frontal lesion with perifocal edema suggestive for high-grade glioma (HGG). For further evaluation, a dynamic F-FET PET scan was performed, which showed high F-FET-uptake with early peak and constantly decreasing time-activity curves, a characteristic feature of HGG. Stereotactic biopsy and histological evaluation excluded a neoplastic lesion but confirmed a manifestation of neurosarcoidosis with strong expression of the L-amino-acid-transporter considered responsible for F-FET-uptake. Therefore, unknown manifestations of neurosarcoidosis represent a clinical pitfall in F-FET PET and can mimic HGG.

Title: Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) for MRI-based 3D mapping of metabolism in vivo.
Abstract: Currently, the only widely available metabolic imaging technique in the clinic is positron emission tomography (PET) detection of the radioactive glucose analog 2-(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)FDG). However, (18)FDG-PET does not inform on metabolism downstream of glucose uptake and often provides ambiguous results in organs with intrinsic high glucose uptake, such as the brain. Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is a novel, noninvasive approach that combines deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging with oral intake or intravenous infusion of nonradioactive (2)H-labeled substrates to generate three-dimensional metabolic maps. DMI can reveal glucose metabolism beyond mere uptake and can be used with other (2)H-labeled substrates as well. We demonstrate DMI by mapping metabolism in the brain and liver of animal models and human subjects using [6,6'-(2)H(2)]glucose or [(2)H(3)]acetate. In a rat glioma model, DMI revealed pronounced metabolic differences between normal brain and tumor tissue, with high-contrast metabolic maps depicting the Warburg effect. We observed similar metabolic patterns and image contrast in two patients with a high-grade brain tumor after oral intake of (2)H-labeled glucose. Further, DMI used in rat and human livers showed [6,6'-(2)H(2)]glucose stored as labeled glycogen. DMI is a versatile, robust, and easy-to-implement technique that requires minimal modifications to existing clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanners. DMI has great potential to become a widespread method for metabolic imaging in both (pre)clinical research and the clinic.

Title: Is Visible Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Fluorescence an Independent Biomarker for Prognosis in Histologically Confirmed (World Health Organization 2016) Low-Grade Gliomas?
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of low-grade gliomas (LGG) display visible protoporphyrin fluorescence during surgery after 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) administration. OBJECTIVE: To determine if fluorescence represents a prognostic marker in LGG. METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with LGG (World Health Organization 2016) were operated on with 5-ALA. Fluorescent tissue was specifically biopsied. Tumor size, age, Karnofsky index, contrast-enhancement, fluorescence, and molecular factors (IDH1/IDH2-mutations, Ki67/MIB1 Index, 1p19q codeletions, ATRX, EGFR, p53 expression, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promotor methylation), were related to progression-free survival (PFS), malignant transformation-free survival (MTFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Sixteen of seventy-four LGGs (21.6%) fluoresced. Fluorescence was partially related to weak enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging and increased (positron emission tomography)PET-FET uptake, but not to Karnofsky Performance Score, tumor size, or age. Regarding molecular markers, only EGFR expression differed marginally (fluorescing vs nonfluorescing: 19% vs 5%; P = .057). Median follow-up was 46.4 mo (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.8-51.1). PFS, MTFS, and OS were shorter in fluorescing tumors (PFS: median 9.8 mo, 95% CI: 1.00-27.7 vs 45.8, 31.9-59.7, MTFS: 43.0 [27.5-58.5] vs 64.6 [57.7-71.5], median not reached, P = .015; OS: 51.6, [34.8-68.3] vs [68.2, 62.7-73.8], P = .002). IDH mutations significantly predicted PFS, MTFS, and OS. In multivariate analysis IDH status and fluorescence both independently predicted MTFS and OS. PFS was not independently predicted by fluorescence. CONCLUSION: This is the first report investigating the role of ALA-induced fluorescence in histologically confirmed LGG. Fluorescence appeared to be a marker for inherent malignant transformation and OS, independently of known prognostic markers. Fluorescence in LGG might be taken into account when deciding on adjuvant therapies.

Title: Paediatric gliomas: diagnosis, molecular biology and management.
Abstract: Paediatric gliomas represent the most common brain tumour in children. Early diagnosis and treatment greatly improve survival. Histological grade is the most significant classification system affecting treatment planning and prognosis. Paediatric gliomas depend on pathways and genes responsible for mitotic activity and cell proliferation as well as angiogenesis (MAPK, VEGF, EFGR pathways). Symptoms such as focal neurologic deficit or seizures can facilitate diagnosis, but they are not always present and therefore diagnosis is occasionally delayed. Imaging has adequate diagnostic accuracy (surpassing 90%), and novel imaging techniques such as MR spectroscopy and PET increase only slightly this percentage. Low grade gliomas (LGG) can be approached conservatively but most authors suggest surgical excision. High grade gliomas (HGG) are always operated with exception of specific contradictions including butterfly or extensive dominant hemisphere gliomas. Surgical excision is universally followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which slightly increase survival. Inoperable cases can be managed with or without radiosurgery depending on location and size, with adjunctive use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical excision must be aggressive and gross total resection (GTR) should be attempted, if possible, since it can triple survival. Radiosurgery is effective on smaller tumours of <2 cm(2). Surgical excision is always the treatment of choice, but glioma recurrences, and residual tumours in non-critical locations are candidates for radiosurgery especially if tumour volume is low. Management of recurrences includes surgery, radiosurgery and chemoradiotherapy and it should be individualized according to location and size. In combination with molecular targeted therapeutic schemes, glioma management will be immensely improved in the next years.

Title: Quantification of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine kinetics in glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study identified the optimal tracer kinetic model for quantification of dynamic O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) positron emission tomography (PET) studies in seven patients with diffuse glioma (four glioblastoma, three lower grade glioma). The performance of more simplified approaches was evaluated by comparison with the optimal compartment model. Additionally, the relationship with cerebral blood flow-determined by [(15)O]H(2)O PET-was investigated. RESULTS: The optimal tracer kinetic model was the reversible two-tissue compartment model. Agreement analysis of binding potential estimates derived from reference tissue input models with the distribution volume ratio (DVR)-1 derived from the plasma input model showed no significant average difference and limits of agreement of - 0.39 and 0.37. Given the range of DVR-1 (- 0.25 to 1.5), these limits are wide. For the simplified methods, the 60-90 min tumour-to-blood ratio to parent plasma concentration yielded the highest correlation with volume of distribution V(T) as calculated by the plasma input model (r = 0.97). The 60-90 min standardized uptake value (SUV) showed better correlation with V(T) (r = 0.77) than SUV based on earlier intervals. The 60-90 min SUV ratio to contralateral healthy brain tissue showed moderate agreement with DVR with no significant average difference and limits of agreement of - 0.24 and 0.30. A significant but low correlation was found between V(T) and CBF in the tumour regions (r = 0.61, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Uptake of [(18)F]FET was best modelled by a reversible two-tissue compartment model. Reference tissue input models yielded estimates of binding potential which did not correspond well with plasma input-derived DVR-1. In comparison, SUV ratio to contralateral healthy brain tissue showed slightly better performance, if measured at the 60-90 min interval. SUV showed only moderate correlation with V(T). V(T) shows correlation with CBF in tumour.

Title: The prognostic value of [(123)I]-vascular endothelial growth factor ([(123)I]-VEGF) in glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown that tumor vascular endothelial cells and various tumor cells overexpress receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of [(123)I]-VEGF scintigraphy in patients with histologically verified brain tumors. METHODS: 23 consecutive patients (9 women and 14 men aged 30-83 years, mean age 56.6 +/- 14.4 years) with histopathologically-verified primary brain tumors were included in the study. All patients had undergone [(123)I]-VEGF scintigraphy. SPECT examinations of brain were performed 30 min and 18 h after injection. Additional [(11)C]-methionine PET ([(11)C]-MET PET) was performed in eight of the 23 patients. Both [(123)I]-VEGF and [(11)C]-MET PET were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively by tumor-to-normal brain uptake ratio (T/N ratio). Thresholds of the T/N ratio were evaluated by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma lesions showed [(123)I]-VEGF uptake 18 h after the injection, whereas other brain tumors of grade II or III showed negative results. There was no significant difference in the tumor size between VEGF positive and VEGF negative tumors. Patients with [(123)I]-VEGF T/N ratio threshold <1.32 showed significantly longer survival than patients with T/N ratio >/= 1.32 (2680 days vs 295 days; P < 0.05). In the subgroup of 16 grade IV glioma patients, significant OS differences were found using a T/N ratio of 1.75 as threshold (T/N ratio < 1.75: 720 days; T/N >/= 1.75: 183 days; P < 0.05). Significant difference (P < 0.05) was also found in [(11)C]-MET PET T/N ratios between the grade IV glioma (mean T/N ratio: 3.71) and the grade II or III glioma (mean T/N ratio: 1.74). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that [(123)I]-VEGF scintigraphy may be useful for visualization of tumor angiogenesis. In addition, [(123)I]-VEGF may provide relevant prognostic information in patients with glioma.

Title: Combined 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 and 18F-FDG PET/CT Can Discriminate Uncommon Meningioma Mimicking High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Uncommon pathological subtypes of meningioma may present with severe peritumoral brain edema and mimic high-grade glioma (HGG). In a prospective cohort study of Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT to evaluate glioma, we occasionally observed that a combination of Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 and F-FDG was able to differentiate these 2 lesion types. METHODS: From 2013 to 2016, 21 patients suspected of HGG by MRI were recruited for evaluation using Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT. Brain F-FDG PET/CT was performed within 3 days for comparison, and the tumor was surgically removed. The PET results were compared with integrin alphavbeta3 expression and microvascular density quantification of tumor samples. RESULTS: Of the 21 recruited patients, 5 patients were finally pathologically diagnosed as uncommon meningioma with severe peritumoral brain edema, including chordoid meningioma (n = 1), angiomatous meningioma (n = 1), and mixed angiomatous and microcystic meningioma (n = 3). Sixteen were diagnosed as HGG. All the meningioma lesions (n = 5) exhibited intense and homogeneous Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 uptake with higher SUVmax on Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET (1.64-7.86; mean +/- SD, 4.23 +/- 2.48) than the HGG lesions (0.81-2.99; mean +/- SD, 1.57 +/- 0.33; P = 0.0047). Moreover, the uptake ratios of Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 over F-FDG, normalized as lg100 * SUVmax (RGD / FDG), in the uncommon meningiomas were significantly higher than those in HGG (1.87 +/- 1.36 vs 1.04 +/- 0.87, P = 0.0001). A cutoff value of 1.58 was able to discriminate between these lesion types. There were positive correlations among the expression level of integrin alphavbeta3, microvascular density, and the tumor-to-background ratio derived from Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a specific imaging pattern of uncommon meningioma mimicking HGG, in which Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET provided added value to F-FDG PET.

Title: [(18)F]Fluciclovine PET discrimination between high- and low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ability to accurately and non-invasively distinguish high-grade glioma from low-grade glioma remains a challenge despite advances in molecular and magnetic resonance imaging. We investigated the ability of fluciclovine ((18)F) PET as a means to identify and distinguish these lesions in patients with known gliomas and to correlate uptake with Ki-67. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with a total of 18 newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas (n = 6) and high grade gliomas (n = 12) underwent fluciclovine PET imaging after histopathologic assessment. Fluciclovine PET analysis comprised tumor SUV(max) and SUV(mean), as well as metabolic tumor thresholds (1.3*, 1.6*, 1.9*) to normal brain background (TB(max), and TB(mean)). Comparison was additionally made to the proliferative status of the tumor as indicated by Ki-67 values. Fluciclovine uptake greater than normal brain parenchyma was found in all lesions studied. Time activity curves demonstrated statistically apparent flattening of the curves for both high-grade gliomas and low-grade gliomas starting 30 min after injection, suggesting an influx/efflux equilibrium. The best semiquantitative metric in discriminating HGG from LGG was obtained utilizing a metabolic 1 tumor threshold of 1.3* contralateral normal brain parenchyma uptake to create a tumor: background (TB(mean1.3)) cutoff of 2.15 with an overall sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 95.5%. Additionally, using a SUV(max) > 4.3 cutoff gave a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 97.5%. Tumor SUV(mean) and tumor SUV(max) as a ratio to mean normal contralateral brain were both found to be less relevant predictors of tumor grade. Both SUV(max) (R = 0.71, p = 0.0227) and TB(mean) (TB(mean1.3): R = 0.81, p = 0.00081) had a high correlation with the tumor proliferative index Ki-67. CONCLUSIONS: Fluciclovine PET produces high-contrast images between both low-grade and high grade gliomas and normal brain by visual and semiquantitative analysis. Fluciclovine PET appears to discriminate between low-grade glioma and high-grade glioma, but must be validated with a larger sample size.

Title: Correlation of 4'-[methyl-(11)C]-thiothymidine uptake with human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 and thymidine kinase-1 expressions in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We examined expressions of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) and thymidine kinase-1 (TK1), the key enzyme in 4'-[methyl-(11)C]-thiothymidine (4DST) phosphorylation, to elucidate the mechanism of 4DST uptake in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. METHODS: A total of 19 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined with 4DST PET. Tumor lesions were identified as areas of focally increased uptake, exceeding that of normal brain background. For semi-quantitative analysis, tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue (T/N) ratio was determined by dividing the maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) for tumor by that of the mean SUV for reference tissue. The expressions of hENT1, TK1 and Ki-67 in tumor specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry and compared with 4DST T/N ratio. RESULTS: All but two gliomas showed focally increased 4DST uptake. All gliomas showed hENT1 staining, except one grade II glioma, which was also not visualized on 4DST PET. A significant correlation was observed between T/N ratio and hENT1 score (rho = 0.90, p < 0.001). All gliomas showed TK1 staining, except two gliomas which were also not visualized on 4DST PET. There was a significant correlation between T/N ratio and TK1 score (rho = 0.92, p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between T/N ratio and Ki-67 index (rho = 0.50, p < 0.03). CONCLUSION: Results of this preliminary study indicate that expressions of hENT1 and TK1 appear to be important determinants of 4DST uptake in newly diagnosed gliomas.

Title: Fluorescence-guidance in non-Gadolinium enhancing, but FET-PET positive gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We report on five patients with gadolinium-negative (non-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging-MRI) but (18)F-fluoroethyl tyrosine positron-emission tomography (FET-PET) positive glioma (NEG) undergoing surgery under fluorescence-guidance with fluorescein sodium 10% (FL, Alkon, Germany) in combination with a dedicated light filter (YELLOW 560 nm, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). PATIENTS AND METHOD: Since 2017, five patients (3 female, 2 male; mean age 45.4 years) underwent fluorescence-guided surgery for supratentorial, intracerebral lesions which showed no contrast-enhancement in the preoperative MRI but were, however, strongly suspicious for gliomas. Accordingly, all patients received a preoperative FET-PET scan and detailed histopathological workup was performed. After giving written informed consent, all patients received 5 mg/kg of FL at the induction of anesthesia. Surgery was conducted under white light and under the YELLOW 560 nm filter. We reviewed the surgical protocols, navigational storage and the image databases of our surgical microscopes for evidence of intraoperative fluorescence that corresponded to the FET-PET positive area. RESULTS: In all patients we found distinct accordances between the FET-PET positive areas and the fluorescing regions within the targeted lesions. Histopathological workup of the fluorescent tissue revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19-codeleted (WHO grade III) (n = 2), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH-mutant (WHO grade III) (n = 1), oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted (WHO grade II) (n = 1) and pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade I) (n = 1). No adverse events were noted. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of gadolinium-enhancement in the preoperative MRI, all patients intravenously received FL to guide resection. Irrespective of the final grading, FL was extremely helpful in detecting the lesions and in identifying their border zones. In selected patients with NEG, but strong metabolic activity according to the FET-PET, FL may significantly increase the accuracy of surgery.

Title: Differential Diagnosis between Low-Grade and High-Grade Astrocytoma Using System A Amino Acid Transport PET Imaging with C-11-MeAIB: A Comparison Study with C-11-Methionine PET Imaging.
Abstract: INTRODUCTIONS: [N-methyl-C-11]alpha-Methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) is an artificial amino acid radiotracer used for PET study, which is metabolically stable in vivo. In addition, MeAIB is transported by system A neutral amino acid transport, which is observed ubiquitously in all types of mammalian cells. It has already been shown that MeAIB-PET is useful for malignant lymphoma, head and neck cancers, and lung tumors. However, there have been no reports evaluating the usefulness of MeAIB-PET in the diagnosis of brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of system A amino acid transport PET imaging, MeAIB-PET, in clinical brain tumor diagnosis compared to [S-methyl-C-11]-L-methionine (MET)-PET. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (male: 16, female: 15), who were suspected of having brain tumors, received both MeAIB-PET and MET-PET within a 2-week interval. All patients were classified into two groups: Group A as a benign group, which included patients who were diagnosed as low-grade astrocytoma, grade II or less, or other low-grade astrocytoma (n=12) and Group B as a malignant group, which included patients who were diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), or recurrent GBM despite prior surgery or chemoradiotherapy (n=19). PET imaging was performed 20 min after the IV injection of MeAIB and MET, respectively. Semiquantitative analyses of MeAIB and MET uptake using SUVmax and tumor-to-contralateral normal brain tissue (T/N) ratio were evaluated to compare these PET images. ROC analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of MeAIB-PET and MET-PET were also calculated. RESULTS: In MeAIB-PET imaging, the SUVmax was 1.20 +/- 1.29 for the benign group and 2.94 +/- 1.22 for the malignant group (p < 0.005), and the T/N ratio was 3.77 +/- 2.39 for the benign group and 16.83 +/- 2.39 for the malignant group (p < 0.001). In MET-PET, the SUVmax was 3.01 +/- 0.94 for the benign group and 4.72 +/- 1.61 for the malignant group (p < 0.005), and the T/N ratio was 2.64 +/- 1.40 for the benign group and 3.21 +/- 1.14 for the malignant group (n.s.). For the analysis using the T/N ratio, there was a significant difference between the benign and malignant groups with MeAIB-PET with p < 0.001. The result of ROC analysis using the T/N ratio indicated a better diagnosis accuracy for MeAIB-PET for brain tumors than MET-PET (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MeAIB, a system A amino acid transport-specific radiolabeled agents, could provide better assessments for detecting malignant type brain tumors. In a differential diagnosis between low-grade and high-grade astrocytoma, MeAIB-PET is a useful diagnostic imaging tool, especially in evaluations using the T/N ratio. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with UMIN000032498.

Title: Imaging practice in low-grade gliomas among European specialized centers and proposal for a minimum core of imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Imaging studies in diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) vary across centers. In order to establish a minimal core of imaging necessary for further investigations and clinical trials in the field of DLGG, we aimed to establish the status quo within specialized European centers. METHODS: An online survey composed of 46 items was sent out to members of the European Low-Grade Glioma Network, the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies, the German Society of Neurosurgery and the Austrian Society of Neurosurgery. RESULTS: A total of 128 fully completed surveys were received and analyzed. Most centers (n = 96, 75%) were academic and half of the centers (n = 64, 50%) adhered to a dedicated treatment program for DLGG. There were national differences regarding the sequences enclosed in MRI imaging and use of PET, however most included T1 (without and with contrast, 100%), T2 (100%) and TIRM or FLAIR (20, 98%). DWI is performed by 80% of centers and 61% of centers regularly performed PWI. CONCLUSION: A minimal core of imaging composed of T1 (w/wo contrast), T2, TIRM/FLAIR, PWI and DWI could be identified. All morphologic images should be obtained in a slice thickness of </= 3 mm. No common standard could be obtained regarding advanced MRI protocols and PET. IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY: We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we were able to determine similarities in numerous aspects of LGG imaging. Using the proposed "minimal core of imaging" in clinical routine will facilitate future cooperative studies.

Title: (18)F-FET-PET as a biomarker for therapy response in non-contrast enhancing glioma following chemotherapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Monitoring treatment response after chemotherapy of gadolinium-(Gd)-negative gliomas is challenging as conventional MRI often indicates no radiological changes. We hypothesize that (18)F-FET-PET can be used as a biomarker for response assessment in Gd-negative gliomas undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Sixty-one patients harboring Gd-negative WHO grade II or III glioma receiving alkylating agents (temozolomide or CCNU/procarbacine) were included. All patients underwent MRI and (18)F-FET-PET before chemotherapy and 6 months later. We calculated T(2)-volume, (18)F-FET-PET based biological tumour volume (BTV) and maximal tumour-to-brain ratio (TBR(max)). Moreover, dynamic PET acquisition was performed using time-activity-curves (TACs) analysis. For MRI-based response assessment, RANO criteria for low-grade glioma were used. For (18)F-FET-PET, following classification scheme was tested: responsive disease (RD) when a decrease in either BTV >/= 25% and/or TBR(max) >/= 10% occurred, an increase in BTV >/= 25% and/or TBR(max) increase > 10% characterized progressive disease (PD), minor changes +/- 25% for BTV and +/- 10% for TBR(max) were regarded as stable disease (SD). Post-chemotherapy survival (PCS) and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: (18)F-FET-PET based response has shown patients with RD to have the longest TTF time (78.5 vs 24.6 vs 24.1 months, p = 0.001), while there was no significant difference between patients with a SD and PD. A comparable pattern was observed for PCS (p < 0.001). T(2)-volume based assessment was not associated with outcome. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET-PET is a promising biomarker for early response assessment in Gd-negative gliomas undergoing chemotherapy. It might be helpful for a timely adjustment of potentially ineffective treatment concepts and overcomes limitations of conventional structural imaging.

Title: The brain-penetrant clinical ATM inhibitor AZD1390 radiosensitizes and improves survival of preclinical brain tumor models.
Abstract: Poor survival rates of patients with tumors arising from or disseminating into the brain are attributed to an inability to excise all tumor tissue (if operable), a lack of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of chemotherapies/targeted agents, and an intrinsic tumor radio-/chemo-resistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein orchestrates the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) to cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR). ATM genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition results in tumor cell hypersensitivity to IR. We report the primary pharmacology of the clinical-grade, exquisitely potent (cell IC(50), 0.78 nM), highly selective [>10,000-fold over kinases within the same phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family], orally bioavailable ATM inhibitor AZD1390 specifically optimized for BBB penetration confirmed in cynomolgus monkey brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of microdosed (11)C-labeled AZD1390 (K(p,uu), 0.33). AZD1390 blocks ATM-dependent DDR pathway activity and combines with radiation to induce G(2) cell cycle phase accumulation, micronuclei, and apoptosis. AZD1390 radiosensitizes glioma and lung cancer cell lines, with p53 mutant glioma cells generally being more radiosensitized than wild type. In in vivo syngeneic and patient-derived glioma as well as orthotopic lung-brain metastatic models, AZD1390 dosed in combination with daily fractions of IR (whole-brain or stereotactic radiotherapy) significantly induced tumor regressions and increased animal survival compared to IR treatment alone. We established a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-efficacy relationship by correlating free brain concentrations, tumor phospho-ATM/phospho-Rad50 inhibition, apoptotic biomarker (cleaved caspase-3) induction, tumor regression, and survival. On the basis of the data presented here, AZD1390 is now in early clinical development for use as a radiosensitizer in central nervous system malignancies.

Title: Convection-enhanced delivery for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: a single-centre, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is one of the deadliest central nervous system tumours of childhood, with a median overall survival of less than 12 months. Convection-enhanced delivery has been proposed as a means to efficiently deliver therapeutic agents directly into the brainstem while minimising systemic exposure and associated toxic effects. We did this study to evaluate the safety of convection-enhanced delivery of a radioimmunotherapy agent targeting the glioma-associated B7-H3 antigen in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS: We did a phase 1, single-arm, single-centre, dose-escalation study at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Eligible patients were aged 3-21 years and had diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma as diagnosed by consensus of a multidisciplinary paediatric neuro-oncology team; a Lansky (patients <16 years of age) or Karnofsky (patients >/=16 years) performance score of at least 50 at study entry; a minimum weight of 8 kg; and had completed external beam radiation therapy (54.0-59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction over 30-33 fractions) at least 4 weeks but no more than 14 weeks before enrolment. Seven dose-escalation cohorts were planned based on standard 3 + 3 rules: patients received a single infusion of 9.25, 18.5, 27.75, 37, 92.5, 120.25, or 148 MBq, respectively, at a concentration of about 37 MBq/mL by convection-enhanced delivery of the radiolabelled antibody [(124)I]-8H9. The primary endpoint was identification of the maximum tolerated dose. The analysis of the primary endpoint was done in the per-protocol population (patients who received the full planned dose of treatment), and all patients who received any dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01502917, and is ongoing with an expanded cohort. FINDINGS: From April 5, 2012, to Oct 8, 2016, 28 children were enrolled and treated in the trial, of whom 25 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached as no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One (4%) of 28 patients had treatment-related transient grade 3 hemiparesis and one (4%) had grade 3 skin infection. No treatment-related grade 4 adverse events or deaths occurred. Estimated volumes of distribution (Vd) were linearly dependent on volumes of infusion (Vi) and ranged from 1.5 to 20.1 cm(3), with a mean Vd/Vi ratio of 3.4 (SD 1.2). The mean lesion absorbed dose was 0.39 Gy/MBq (124)I (SD 0.20). Systemic exposure was negligible, with an average lesion-to-whole body ratio of radiation absorbed dose higher than 1200. INTERPRETATION: Convection-enhanced delivery in the brainstem of children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma who have previously received radiation therapy seems to be a rational and safe therapeutic strategy. PET-based dosimetry of the radiolabelled antibody [(124)I]-8H9 validated the principle of using convection-enhanced delivery in the brain to achieve high intra-lesional dosing with negligible systemic exposure. This therapeutic strategy warrants further development for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

Title: The Treatment of Gliomas in Adulthood.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gliomas are the most common intrinsic tumors of the brain, with an incidence of 6 per 100 000 persons per year. Recent years have seen marked changes in the diagnosis and treatment of gliomas, with molecular parameters now being an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, with special attention to the new WHO glioma classification. RESULTS: The classification of gliomas on the basis of additional molecular parameters enables more accurate prognostication and serves as a basis for therapeutic decision-making and treatment according to precisely specified algorithms. PET scanning with 18F-fluoroethyl tyrosine and 11C-methionine for the measurement of metabolic activity in gliomas has further refined the diagnostic evaluation. The median overall survival of patients with glioblastoma who have undergone resection of all tumor tissue with a disrupted blood-brain barrier (i.e., all contrast-enhancing tumor tissue) has been prolonged to up to 20 months. The 5-year survival of patients with WHO grade II gliomas is now as high as 97% after near-total resection. The surgical resection of all contrast-enhancing tumor tissue and subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the key elements of treatment. New surgical strategies and new methods of planning radiotherapy have made these techniques safer and more effective. The percutaneous application of tumor-treating fields is a new therapeutic option that has gained a degree of acceptance. Accompanying measures such as psycho-oncology and palliative care are very important for patients and should be considered mandatory. CONCLUSION: The consistent application of the existing multimodal treatment options for glioma has led in recent years to improved survival. Areas of important current and future scientific activity include immunotherapy and targeted and combined chemotherapy, as well as altered neurocognition, modern approaches to palliative care, and complementary therapies.

Title: PET imaging of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, as compared with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, in experimental rodent models of engrafted glioblastoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracers triggering alphavbeta3 integrins, such as certain RGD-containing peptides, were found promising in previous pilot studies characterizing high-grade gliomas. However, only limited comparisons have been performed with current PET tracers. This study aimed at comparing the biodistribution of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) with that of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, an easily synthesized monomeric RGD compound with rapid kinetics, in two different rodent models of engrafted human glioblastoma. METHODS: Nude rodents bearing human U87-MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in the flank (34 tumors in mice) or in the brain (5 tumors in rats) were analyzed. Kinetics of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD and of (18)F-FDG were compared with PET imaging in the same animals, along with additional autohistoradiographic analyses and blocking tests for (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD. RESULTS: Both tracers showed a primary renal route of clearance, although with faster clearance for (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD resulting in higher activities in the kidneys and bladder. The tumor activity from (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD, likely corresponding to true integrin binding (i.e., suppressed by co-injection of a saturating excess of unlabeled RGD), was found relatively high, but only at the 2(nd) hour following injection, corresponding on average to 53% of total tumor activity. Tumor uptake of (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD decreased progressively with time, contrary to that of (18)F-FDG, although (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD exhibited 3.4 and 3.7-fold higher tumor-to-normal brain ratios on average compared to (18)F-FDG in mice and rat models, respectively. Finally, ex-vivo analyses revealed that the tumor areas with high (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD uptake also exhibited the highest rates of cell proliferation and alphav integrin expression, irrespective of cell density. CONCLUSIONS: (68)Ga-NODAGA-RGD has a high potential for PET imaging of glioblastomas, especially for areas with high integrin expression and cell proliferation, although PET recording needs to be delayed until the 2(nd) hour following injection in order to provide sufficiently high integrin specificity.

Title: Is It Possible to Establish the Extent of Resection of Glioblastoma With 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT?
Abstract: Defining high-grade glioma resectability is a challenge; and currently, it is based on anatomical imaging. However, complete removal of contrast-enhancing tumor is difficult to define in MRI. We present three cases of patients diagnosed with high-grade glioma. Brain MRI and F-fluorocholine PET/CT were performed before and after surgery to establish the extent of resection (EOR) and residual volume. Postoperative brain MRI and PET parameters showed discordant results in all the reported cases. PET was able to assess properly the EOR; however, the rules for the EOR establishment and its prognostic implication should be validated in prospective studies.

Title: Dynamic 18F-FET PET is a powerful imaging biomarker in gadolinium-negative gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to elucidate the place of dynamic O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET in prognostic models of gadolinium (Gd)-negative gliomas. METHODS: In 98 patients with Gd-negative gliomas undergoing 18F-FET PET guided biopsy, time activity curves (TACs) of each tumor were qualitatively categorized as either increasing or decreasing. Additionally, post-hoc quantitative analyses were done using minimal time-to-peak (TTPmin) measurements. Prognostic factors were obtained from multivariate hazards models. The fit of the biospecimen- and imaging-derived models was compared. RESULTS: A homogeneous increasing, mixed, and homogeneous decreasing TAC pattern was seen in 51, 19, and 28 tumors, respectively. Mixed TAC tumors exhibited both increasing and decreasing TACs. Corresponding adjusted 5-year survival was 85%, 47%, and 19%, respectively (P < 0.001). Qualitative and quantitative TAC measurements were highly intercorrelated (P < 0.0001). TTPmin was longest (shortest) in the homogeneous increasing (decreasing) TAC group and in between in the mixed TAC group. TTPmin was longer in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors (P < 0.001). Outcome was similarly precisely predicted by biospecimen- and imaging-derived models. In the biospecimen model, World Health Organization (WHO) grade (P < 0.0001) and IDH status (P < 0.001) were predictors for survival. Outcome of homogeneous increasing (homogeneous decreasing) TAC tumors was nearly identical, with both TTPmin > 25 min (TTPmin </= 12.5 min) tumors and IDH-mutant grade II (IDH-wildtype) gliomas. Outcome of mixed TAC tumors matched that of both intermediate TTPmin (>12.5 min and </=25 min) and IDH-mutant, grade III gliomas. Each of the 3 prognostic clusters differed significantly from the other ones of the respective models (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: TAC measurements constitute a powerful biomarker independent from tumor grade and IDH status.

Title: Investigational PET tracers for high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most common primary malignant tumors of the brain, with glioblastoma (GBM) constituting over 50% of all the gliomas in adults. The disease carries very high mortality, and even with optimal treatment, the median survival is 2-5 years for anaplastic tumors and 1-2 years for GBMs. Neuroimaging is critical to managing patients with HGG for diagnosis, treatment planning, response assessment, and detecting recurrent disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone of imaging in neuro-oncology, but molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can overcome some of the inherent limitations of MRI. Additionally, PET has the potential to target metabolic and molecular alterations in HGGs relevant to prognosis and therapy that cannot be assessed with anatomic imaging. Many classes of PET tracers have been evaluated in HGG including agents that target cell membrane biosynthesis, protein synthesis, amino acid transport, DNA synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, hypoxic environments, cell surface receptors, blood flow, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGFR), and the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), among others. This chapter will provide an overview of PET tracers for HGG that have been evaluated in human subjects with a focus on tracers that are not yet in widespread use for neuro-oncology.

Title: Amino acid tracers in PET imaging of diffuse low-grade gliomas: a systematic review of preoperative applications.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using amino acid tracers has in recent years become widely used in the diagnosis and prediction of disease course in diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG). However, implications of preoperative PET for treatment and prognosis in this patient group have not been systematically studied. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the preoperative diagnostic and prognostic value of amino acid PET in suspected diffuse LGG. Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were systematically searched using keywords "PET," "low-grade glioma," and "amino acids tracers" with their respective synonyms. Out of 2137 eligible studies, 28 met the inclusion criteria. Increased amino acid uptake (lesion/brain) was consistently reported among included studies; in 25-92% of subsequently histopathology-verified LGG, in 83-100% of histopathology-verified HGG, and also in some non-neoplastic lesions. No consistent results were found in studies reporting hot spot areas on PET in MRI-suspected LGG. Thus, the diagnostic value of amino acid PET imaging in suspected LGG has proven difficult to interpret, showing clear overlap and inconsistencies among reported results. Similarly, the results regarding the prognostic value of PET in suspected LGG and the correlation between uptake ratios and the molecular tumor status of LGG were conflicting. This systematic review illustrates the difficulties with prognostic studies presenting data on group-level without adjustment for established clinical prognostic factors, leading to a loss of additional prognostic information. We conclude that the prognostic value of PET is limited to analysis of histological subgroups of LGG and is probably strongest when using kinetic analysis of dynamic FET uptake parameters.

Title: Canine (Pet Dog) Tumor Microsurgery and Intratumoral Concentration and Safety of Metronomic Chlorambucil for Spontaneous Glioma: A Phase I Clinical Trial.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Metronomic (daily low-dose) chlorambucil requires further study before use in human patients with glioma. The aim of this study was to investigate distribution and safety of metronomic chlorambucil in naturally occurring canine glioma. METHODS: Eight client-owned (pet) dogs with newly diagnosed spontaneous glioma were prospectively enrolled. Chlorambucil was administered preoperatively at 4 mg/m(2) every 24 hours for >/=3 days and continued postoperatively until death or dose-limiting adverse events. Chlorambucil concentrations in the surgical glioma specimen, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum were analyzed. Dogs additionally received lomustine postoperatively. Dogs were monitored for seizures, myoclonus, cytopenias, and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: Complete microsurgical resection was achieved in 7 oligodendrogliomas and 1 astrocytoma (6 high grade, 2 low grade). Median surgical glioma specimen chlorambucil concentration was 0.52 ng/g (range, 0-2.62 ng/g), or 37% (range, 0%-178%) of serum concentration. Median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 0.1 ng/mL (range, 0-0.3 ng/mL). Chlorambucil was not associated with increase in seizure activity. Six dogs displayed prolonged seizure-free intervals. There was no myoclonus. Three dogs developed asymptomatic thrombocytopenia after 8-12 months of chlorambucil. Median progression-free survival was 253 days (range, 63-860 days). Median overall survival was 257 days (range, 64-860 days). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intratumoral chlorambucil indicated an altered blood-brain barrier that varied from case to case. Despite sporadic previous reports of neurotoxicity, prolonged seizure-free intervals supported a high safety margin at this dose in this species. Metronomic chlorambucil was well tolerated. Spontaneous canine glioma offers a robust preclinical model.

Title: Impact of (18)F-FET PET on Target Volume Definition and Tumor Progression of Recurrent High Grade Glioma Treated with Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy.
Abstract: High-precision radiotherapy (HPR) of recurrent high grade glioma (HGG) requires accurate spatial allocation of these infiltrative tumors. We investigated the impact of (18)F-FET PET on tumor delineation and progression of recurrent HGG after HPR with carbon ions. T(1) contrast enhanced MRI and (18)F-FET-PET scans of 26 HGG patients were fused with radiotherapy planning volumes. PET-positive (PET+) tumor volumes using different isocontours (I%) were systematically investigated and compared with MRI-derived gross tumor volumes (GTV). Standardized uptake ratios (SUR) were further correlated with GTV and tumor progression patterns. In grade IV glioma, SUR > 2.92 significantly correlated with poor median overall survival (6.5 vs 13.1 months, p = 0.00016). We found no reliable SUR cut-off criteria for definition of PET+ volumes. Overall conformity between PET and MRI-based contours was low, with maximum conformities between 0.42-0.51 at I40%. The maximum sensitivity and specificity for PET+ volumes outside of GTV predicting tumor progression were 0.16 (I40%) and 0.52 (I50%), respectively. In 75% of cases, FLAIR hyperintense area covered over 80% of PET+ volumes. (18)F-FET-PET derived SUR has a prognostic impact in grade IV glioma. The value of substantial mismatches between MRI-based GTV and PET+ volumes to improve tumor delineation in radiotherapy awaits further validation in randomized prospective trials.

Title: Integrated analysis of dynamic FET PET/CT parameters, histology, and methylation profiling of 44 gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Dynamic (18)F-FET PET/CT is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of gliomas.(18)F-FET PET time-activity curves (TAC) allow differentiation between histological low-grade gliomas (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). Molecular methods such as epigenetic profiling are of rising importance for glioma grading and subclassification. Here, we analysed dynamic (18)F-FET PET data, and the histological and epigenetic features of 44 gliomas. METHODS: Dynamic (18)F-FET PET was performed in 44 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated glioma: 10 WHO grade II glioma, 13 WHO grade III glioma and 21 glioblastoma (GBM). All patients underwent stereotactic biopsy or tumour resection after (18)F-FET PET imaging. As well as histological analysis of tissue samples, DNA was subjected to epigenetic analysis using the Illumina 850 K methylation array. TACs, standardized uptake values corrected for background uptake in healthy tissue (SUVmax/BG), time to peak (TTP) and kinetic modelling parameters were correlated with histological diagnoses and with epigenetic signatures. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FET PET in relation to the tumour groups identified by histological and methylation-based analysis. RESULTS: Epigenetic profiling led to substantial tumour reclassification, with six grade II/III gliomas reclassified as GBM. Overlap of HGG-typical TACs and LGG-typical TACs was dramatically reduced when tumours were clustered on the basis of their methylation profile. SUVmax/BG values of GBM were higher than those of LGGs following both histological diagnosis and methylation-based diagnosis. The differences in TTP between GBMs and grade II/III gliomas were greater following methylation-based diagnosis than following histological diagnosis. Kinetic modeling showed that relative K1 and fractal dimension (FD) values significantly differed in histology- and methylation-based GBM and grade II/III glioma between those diagnosed histologically and those diagnosed by methylation analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed slightly greater diagnostic accuracy with methylation-based diagnosis. IDH-mutant gliomas and GBM subgroups tended to differ in their (18)F-FET PET kinetics. CONCLUSION: The status of dynamic (18)F-FET PET as a biologically and clinically relevant imaging modality is confirmed in the context of molecular glioma diagnosis.

Title: Influence of region-of-interest designs on quantitative measurement of multimodal imaging of MR non-enhancing gliomas.
Abstract: A number of studies have revealed the usefulness of multimodal imaging in gliomas. Although the results have been heavily affected by the method used for region of interest (ROI) design, the most discriminatory method for setting the ROI remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the most suitable ROI design for (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the viewpoint of grades of non-enhancing gliomas. A total of 31 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed magnetic resonance (MR) non-enhancing gliomas who underwent FDG-PET, MET-PET and DTI were retrospectively investigated. Quantitative measurements were performed using four different ROIs; hotspot/tumor center and whole tumor, constructed in either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). Histopathological grading of the tumor was considered as empirical truth and the quantitative measurements obtained from each ROI was correlated with the grade of the tumor. The most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the different imaging modalities. 2D-hotspot/center ROI was most discriminating for FDG-PET (P=0.087), ADC map (P=0.0083), and FA map (P=0.25), whereas 3D-whole tumor ROI was best for MET-PET (P=0.0050). In the majority of scenarios, 2D-ROIs performed better than 3D-ROIs. Results from the image analysis using FDG-PET, MET-PET, ADC and FA may be affected by ROI design and the most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the imaging modality.

Title: The role of amino-acid PET in the light of the new WHO classification 2016 for brain tumors.
Abstract: Since its introduction in 2016, the revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors has already changed the diagnostic and therapeutic approach in glial tumors. Blurring the lines between entities formerly labelled as "high-grade" or "low-grade", molecular markers define distinct biological subtypes with different clinical course. This new classification raises the demand for non-invasive imaging methods focusing on depicting metabolic processes. We performed a review of current literature on the use of amino-acid PET (AA-PET) for obtaining diagnostic or prognostic information on glioma in the setting of the current WHO 2016 classification. So far, only a few studies have focused on combining molecular genetic information and metabolic imaging using AA-PET. The current review summarizes the information available on "molecular grading" as well as prognostic information obtained from AA-PET and delivers an insight into a possible interrelation between metabolic imaging and glioma genetics. Within the framework of molecular characterization of gliomas, metabolic imaging using AA-PET is a promising tool for non-invasive characterization of molecular features and to provide additional prognostic information. Further studies incorporating molecular and metabolic features are necessary to improve the explanatory power of AA-PET in glial tumors.

Title: Investigation of cis-4-[(18)F]Fluoro-D-Proline Uptake in Human Brain Tumors After Multimodal Treatment.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Cis-4-[(18)F]fluoro-D-proline (D-cis-[(18)F]FPro) has been shown to pass the intact blood-brain barrier and to accumulate in areas of secondary neurodegeneration and necrosis in the rat brain while uptake in experimental brain tumors is low. This pilot study explores the uptake behavior of D-cis-[(18)F]FPro in human brain tumors after multimodal treatment. PROCEDURES: In a prospective study, 27 patients with suspected recurrent brain tumor after treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy (SRC) were investigated by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) using D-cis-[(18)F]FPro (22 high-grade gliomas, one unspecified glioma, and 4 metastases). Furthermore, two patients with untreated lesions were included (one glioblastoma, one reactive astrogliosis). Data were compared with the results of PET using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET) which detects viable tumor tissue. Tracer distribution, mean and maximum lesion-to-brain ratios (LBR(mean), LBR(max)), and time-to-peak (TTP) of the time activity curve (TAC) of tracer uptake were evaluated. Final diagnosis was determined by histology (n = 9), clinical follow-up (n = 10), or by [(18)F]FET PET (n = 10). RESULTS: D-cis-[(18)F]FPro showed high uptake in both recurrent brain tumors (n = 11) and lesions classified as treatment-related changes (TRC) only (n = 16) (LBR(mean) 2.2 +/- 0.7 and 2.1 +/- 0.6, n.s.; LBR(max) 3.4 +/- 1.2 and 3.2 +/- 1.3, n.s.). The untreated glioblastoma and the lesion showing reactive astrogliosis exhibited low D-cis-[(18)F]FPro uptake. Distribution of [(18)F]FET and D-cis-[(18)F]FPro uptake was discordant in 21/29 cases indicating that the uptake mechanisms are different. CONCLUSION: The high accumulation of D-cis-[(18)F]FPro in pretreated brain tumors and TRC supports the hypothesis that tracer uptake is related to cell death. Further studies before and after therapy are needed to assess the potential of D-cis-[(18)F]FPro for treatment monitoring.

Title: (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI characteristics correlate with degree of malignancy and predict survival in treatment-naive gliomas: a cross-sectional study.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To report the potential value of pre-operative (18)F-FDOPA PET and anatomic MRI in diagnosis and prognosis of glioma patients. METHODS: Forty-five patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioma with pre-operative (18)F-FDOPA PET and anatomic MRI were retrospectively examined. The volume of contrast enhancement and T2 hyperintensity on MRI images along with the ratio of maximum (18)F-FDOPA SUV in tumor to normal tissue (T/N SUV(max)) were measured and used to predict tumor grade, molecular status, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between WHO grade and: the volume of contrast enhancement (r = 0.67), volume of T2 hyperintensity (r = 0.42), and (18)F-FDOPA uptake (r = 0.60) (P < 0.01 for each correlation). The volume of contrast enhancement and (18)F-FDOPA T/N SUV(max) were significantly higher in glioblastoma (WHO IV) compared with lower grade gliomas (WHO I-III), as well as for high-grade gliomas (WHO III-IV) compared with low-grade gliomas (WHO I-II). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analyses confirmed the volume of contrast enhancement and (18)F-FDOPA T/N SUV(max) could each differentiate patient groups. No significant differences in (18)F-FDOPA uptake were observed by IDH or MGMT status. Multivariable Cox regression suggested age (HR 1.16, P = 0.0001) and continuous measures of (18)F-FDOPA PET T/N SUV(max) (HR 4.43, P = 0.016) were significant prognostic factors for OS in WHO I-IV gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest a potential role for the use of pre-operative (18)F-FDOPA PET in suspected glioma. Increased (18)F-FDOPA uptake may not only predict higher glioma grade, but also worse OS.

Title: The diagnostic accuracy of detecting malignant transformation of low-grade glioma using O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine positron emission tomography: a retrospective study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic accuracy of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) PET scanning in detecting the malignant transformation of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) is controversial. In this study, the authors retrospectively assessed the diagnostic potential of FET PET in patients with MRI-suspected malignant progression of LGGs that had previously been treated and the relationship between FET uptake and MRI and molecular biomarkers. METHODS: Forty-two patients who had previously undergone surgical or multimodal treatment for a histologically verified LGG were referred for FET PET assessment because of clinical signs and/or MRI findings suggestive of tumor progression. Maximal and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBRmax and TBRmean, respectively) on FET PET as well as kinetic FET PET parameters (time to peak [TTP] and time-activity curve [TAC]) were determined. Final diagnoses were confirmed histologically. The diagnostic accuracy of FET parameters, separately and combined, for the detection of malignant progression was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Possible predictors that might influence the diagnostic accuracy of FET PET were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Spearman's rank correlation r method was applied to determine the correlation between TBRmax and TAC, and molecular biomarkers from tumor tissues. RESULTS: A total of 47 FET PET scans were obtained and showed no significant association between FET parameters and contrast enhancement on MRI. ROC curve analyses overall were unable to demonstrate any significant differentiation between nontransformed LGGs and LGGs that had transformed to high-grade gliomas when evaluating FET parameters separately or combined. After excluding the oligodendroglial subgroup, a significant difference was observed between nontransformed and transformed LGGs when combining FET parameters (i.e., TBRmax > 1.6, TAC describing a plateau or decreasing pattern, and TTP < 25 minutes), with the best result yielded by a combined analysis of TBRmax > 1.6 and TAC with a plateau or decreasing pattern (sensitivity 75% and specificity 83%, p = 0.003). The difference was even greater when patients who had previously undergone oncological treatment were also excluded (sensitivity 93% and specificity 100%, p = 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of an oligodendroglial component (p = 0.029), previous oncological treatment (p = 0.039), and the combined FET parameters (p = 0.027) were significant confounding factors in the detection of malignant progression. TBRmax was positively correlated with increasing cell density (p = 0.040) and inversely correlated with IDH1 mutation (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A single FET PET scan obtained at the time of radiological and/or clinical progression seems to be of limited value in distinguishing transformed from nontransformed LGGs, especially if knowledge of the primary tumor histopathology is not known. Therefore, FET PET imaging alone is not adequate to replace histological confirmation, but it may provide valuable information on the location and delineation of active tumor tissue, as well as an assessment of tumor biology in a subgroup of LGGs.

Title: Use of FET PET in glioblastoma patients undergoing neurooncological treatment including tumour-treating fields: initial experience.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We present our first clinical experience with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET in patients with high-grade glioma treated with various neurooncological therapies including tumour-treating fields (TTFields) for the differentiation of tumour progression from treatment-related changes. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 12 patients (mean age 51 +/- 12 years, range 33-72 years) with high-grade glioma (11 glioblastomas, 1 gliosarcoma) in whom the treatment regimen included TTFields and who had undergone FET PET scans for differentiation of tumour progression from treatment-related changes. Mean and maximum tumour-to-brain ratios (TBR(mean), TBR(max)) were calculated. The definitive diagnosis (tumour progression or posttherapeutic changes) was confirmed either by histopathology (4 of 12 patients) or on clinical follow-up. RESULTS: In all nine patients with confirmed tumour progression, the corresponding FET PET showed increased uptake (TBR(max) 3.5 +/- 0.6, TBR(mean) 2.7 +/- 0.7). In one of these nine patients, FET PET was consistent with treatment-related changes, whereas standard MRI showed a newly diagnosed contrast-enhancing lesion. In two patients treated solely with TTFields without any other concurrent neurooncological therapy, serial FET PET revealed a decrease in metabolic activity over a follow-up of 6 months or no FET uptake without any signs of tumour progression or residual tumour on conventional MRI. CONCLUSION: FET PET may add valuable information in monitoring therapy in individual patients with high-grade glioma undergoing neurooncological treatment including TTFields.

Title: Transient Focal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Abnormalities After Status Epilepticus Showed 11C-Methionine Uptake with Positron Emission Tomography in a Patient with Cerebral Cavernous Malformation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transient focal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities after status epilepticus (SE) are rarely seen in patients with benign brain tumors, and the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We report a rare case of cerebral cavernous malformation with transient focal MRI abnormalities around the tumor and accumulation of 11C-methionine on positron emission tomography (PET) after SE. These findings mimicked those of a glioma because the MRI and methionine PET findings were similar. We also speculate about the cause of this phenomenon in relation to pathologic findings of this case. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man suffered from SE. MRI demonstrated a focal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense area. 11C-methionine PET showed high accumulation of methionine in the same lesion. The initial diagnosis was low-grade glioma. However, these MRI abnormalities were transient and completely resolved. The patient underwent surgical removal of the tumor, and the histologic diagnosis was typical cavernous malformation. Pathologic findings of the gyrus around the tumor revealed mild gliosis with proliferating astrocytes but no evidence of glioma. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that transient focal MRI abnormalities after SE may indicate reversible cortical brain edema. Accumulation of 11C-methionine on PET could occur in the corresponding lesion even if no malignant tumor is present. Because distinguishing transient MRI abnormalities after SE from a glioma is difficult, repeated imaging studies should be performed in patients with brain tumor-related seizures.

Title: Positron emission tomography of sodium glucose cotransport activity in high grade astrocytomas.
Abstract: A novel glucose transporter, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), has been demonstrated to contribute to the demand for glucose by pancreatic and prostate tumors, and its functional activity has been imaged using a SGLT specific PET imaging probe, alpha-methyl-4-[F-18]fluoro-4-deoxy-D-glucopyaranoside (Me-4FDG). In this study, Me-4FDG PET was extended to evaluate patients with high-grade astrocytic tumors. Me-4FDG PET scans were performed in four patients diagnosed with WHO Grade III or IV astrocytomas and control subjects, and compared with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (2-FDG) PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same subjects. Immunocytochemistry was carried out on Grade IV astrocytomas to determine the cellular location of SGLT proteins within the tumors. Me-4FDG retention was pronounced in astrocytomas in dramatic contrast to the lack of uptake into the normal brain, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio. Macroscopically, the distribution of Me-4FDG within the tumors overlapped with that of 2-FDG uptake and tumor definition using contrast-enhanced MRI images. Microscopically, the SGLT2 protein was found to be expressed in neoplastic glioblastoma cells and endothelial cells of the proliferating microvasculature. This preliminary study shows that Me-4FDG is a highly sensitive probe for visualization of high-grade astrocytomas by PET. The distribution of Me-4FDG within tumors overlapped that for 2-FDG, but the absence of background brain Me-4FDG resulted in superior imaging sensitivity. Furthermore, the presence of SGLT2 protein in astrocytoma cells and the proliferating microvasculature may offer a novel therapy using the SGLT2 inhibitors already approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Title: Potential use of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for detecting the tumor neovasculature of brain tumors by PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M anti-PSMA minibody.
Abstract: Tumor angiogenesis has attracted increasing attention because of its potential as a valuable marker in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors as well as a novel therapeutic target. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed by the neovasculature endothelium of some tumors, with little to no expression by the tumor cells or normal vasculature endothelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of PSMA for the evaluation of the tumor neovasculature of various brain tumors and the possibility of detecting PSMA expression in brain tumors using PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M (anti-PSMA minibody). Eighty-three tissue specimens including gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL), or radiation necroses were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with PSMA antibody. (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M PET scans were performed in three patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas or metastatic brain tumor. PSMA was highly expressed in the vascular endothelium of high-grade glioma and metastatic brain tumor, whereas PSMA was poorly expressed in the vascular endothelium of PCNSL and radiation necrosis. PSMA expression in high-grade gliomas and a metastatic brain tumor was clearly visualized by PET imaging with (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M. Furthermore, a trend toward a positive correlation between the degree of (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M uptake and PSMA expression levels in tumor specimens was observed. PET imaging of PSMA using (89)Zr-Df-IAB2M may have potential value in the differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma from PCNSL or radiation necrosis as well as in the prediction of treatment efficacy and assessment of treatment response to bevacizumab therapy for high-grade glioma.

Title: A surgical strategy using a fusion image constructed from 11C-methionine PET, 18F-FDG-PET and MRI for glioma with no or minimum contrast enhancement.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of 11C-methionine (MET) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the hyperintense area in T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) in glioma with no or poor gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI). Cases were also analyzed pathologically. We prospectively investigated 16 patients with non- or minimally enhancing (< 10% volume) glioma. All patients underwent MET-PET and FDG-PET scans preoperatively. After delineating the tumor based on MET uptake, integrated 3D images from FDG-PET and MRI (GdMRI, T2WI or FLAIR) were generated and the final resection plane was planned. This resection plane was determined intraoperatively using the navigation-guided fencepost method. The delineation obtained by MET-PET imaging was larger than that with GdMRI in all cases with an enhanced effect. In contrast, the T2WI-abnormal signal area (T2WI+) tended to be larger than the MET uptake area (MET+). Tumor resection was > 95% in the non-eloquent area in 4/5 cases (80%), whereas 10 of 11 cases (90.9%) had partial resection in the eloquent area. In a case including the language area, 92% resection was achieved based on the MET-uptake area, in contrast to T2WI-based partial resection (65%), because the T2WI+/MET- area defined the language area. Pathological findings showed that the T2WI+/MET+ area is glioma, whereas 6 of 9 T2WI+/MET- lesions included normal tissues. Tissue from T2W1+/MET+/FDG+/GdMRI+ lesions gave an accurate diagnosis of grade in six cases. Non- or minimally enhancing gliomas were classified as having a MET uptake area that totally or partially overlapped with the T2WI hyperintense area. Resection planning with or without a metabolically active area in non- or minimally enhancing gliomas may be useful for accurate diagnosis, malignancy grading, and particularly for eloquent area although further study is needed to analyze the T2WI+/MET- area.

Title: The roles of (11)C-acetate PET/CT in predicting tumor differentiation and survival in patients with cerebral glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This prospective study aimed to evaluate the clinical values of (11)C-acetate positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in predicting histologic grades and survival in patients with cerebral glioma. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with surgically confirmed cerebral gliomas (19 grade II, 21 grade III, and 33 grade IV) who underwent (11)C-acetate PET/CT before surgery were included. Tumor-to-choroid plexus ratio (TCR), which was defined as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of tumors to the mean SUV of choroid plexus, was compared between three World Health Organization (WHO) grade groups. Moreover, metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) were calculated. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Median TCR was 1.20 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.14 to 1.4) in grade II, 1.65 (IQR, 1.26 to 1.79) in grade III, and 2.53 (IQR, 1.93 to 3.30) in grade IV gliomas. Significant differences in TCR were seen among the three WHO grade groups (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analysis including TCR, MTV, molecular markers, and other clinical factors, TCR was prognostic for PFS (P = 0.016) and TCR and MTV were prognostic for OS (P = 0.024 [TCR], P = 0.030 [MTV]). PFS and OS were significantly shorter in patients with a TCR >/= 1.6 than in those with a TCR < 1.6. OS were significantly shorter in patients with a MTV >/= 1 than in those with a TCR < 1. CONCLUSIONS: TCR on (11)C-acetate PET/CT significantly differed between low- and high-grade cerebral gliomas, and it showed the capability to further differentiate grade III from grade IV tumors. TCR and MTV were independent prognostic factors and predicted survival better than did the WHO grade.

Title: Biological tumour volumes of gliomas in early and standard 20-40 min (18)F-FET PET images differ according to IDH mutation status.
Abstract: PURPOSE: For the clinical evaluation of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET images, the use of standard summation images obtained 20-40 min after injection is recommended. However, early summation images obtained 5-15 min after injection have been reported to allow better differentiation between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) by capturing the early (18)F-FET uptake peak specific for HGG. We compared early and standard summation images with regard to delineation of the PET-derived biological tumour volume (BTV) in correlation with the molecular genetic profile according the updated 2016 WHO classification. METHODS: The analysis included 245 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically verified glioma and a positive (18)F-FET PET scan prior to any further treatment. BTVs were delineated during the early 5-15 min and standard 20-40 min time frames using a threshold of 1.6 x background activity and were compared intraindividually. Volume differences between early and late summation images of >20% were considered significant and were correlated with WHO grade and the molecular genetic profile (IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status). RESULTS: In 52.2% of the patients (128/245), a significant difference in BTV of >20% between early and standard summation images was found. While 44.3% of WHO grade II gliomas (31 of 70) showed a significantly smaller BTV in the early summation images, 35.0% of WHO grade III gliomas (28/80) and 37.9% of WHO grade IV gliomas (36/95) had a significantly larger BTVs. Among IDH-wildtype gliomas, an even higher portion (44.4%, 67/151) showed significantly larger BTVs in the early summation images, which was observed in 5.3% (5/94) of IDH-mutant gliomas only: most of the latter had significantly smaller BTVs in the early summation images, i.e. 51.2% of IDH-mutant gliomas without 1p/19q codeletion (21/41) and 39.6% with 1p/19q codeletion (21/53). CONCLUSION: BTVs delineated in early and standard summation images differed significantly in more than half of gliomas. While the standard summation images seem appropriate for delineation of LGG as well as IDH-mutant gliomas, a remarkably high percentage of HGG and, particularly, IDH-wildtype gliomas were depicted with significantly larger volumes in early summation images. This finding might be of interest for optimization of treatment planning (e.g. radiotherapy) in accordance with the individual IDH mutation status.

Title: Glioma grading by dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion and (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography using different regions of interest.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The use of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion and (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) for glioma grading is currently not standardized. The purpose of this study was to identify regions of interest (ROIs) that enable the best performance and clinical applicability in both methods, as well as to evaluate the complementarity of DSC perfusion and MET-PET in spatial hotspot definition. METHODS: In 41 patient PET/MRI datasets, different ROIs were drawn: in T2-hyperintense tumour, in T2-hyperintense tumour and adjacent oedema and in tumour areas with contrast enhancement, altered perfusion or pathological radiotracer uptake. The performance of DSC perfusion and MET-PET using the different ROIs to distinguish high- and low-grade gliomas was assessed. The spatial overlap of hotspots identified by DSC perfusion and MET-PET was assessed visually. RESULTS: ROIs in T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence-hyperintense tumour revealed the most significant differences between high- and low-grade gliomas and reached the highest diagnostic performance in both DSC perfusion (p = 0.046; area under the curve = 0.74) and MET-PET (p = 0.007; area under the curve = 0.80). The combination of methods yielded an area under the curve of 0.80. Hotspots were completely overlapped in one half of the patients, partially overlapped in one third of the patients and present in only one method in approximately 20% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: For multi-parametric examinations with DSC perfusion and MET-PET, we recommend an ROI definition based on T2-hyperintense tumour. DSC perfusion and MET-PET contain complementary information concerning the spatial hotspot definition.

Title: Positron emission tomography (PET) for prediction of glioma histology: protocol for an individual-level data meta-analysis of test performance.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Gliomas, the most commonly diagnosed primary brain tumours, are associated with varied survivals based, in part, on their histological subtype. Therefore, accurate pretreatment tumour grading is essential for patient care and clinical trial design. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform an individual-level data meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the ability of different types of positron emission tomography (PET) to differentiate high from low-grade gliomas. We will search PubMed and Scopus from inception through 30 July 2017 with no language restriction and full-text evaluation of potentially relevant articles. We will choose studies that assess PET using 18-Fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), l-[Methyl-()11C]Methionine (11C-MET), 18F-Fluoro-Ethyl-Tyrosine (18F-FET) or (18)F-Fluorothymidine (18F-FLT)for grading, verified with histological confirmation. We will include both prospective and retrospective studies. Bias will be assessed by two reviewers with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and as per method described by Deeks et al. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not applicable, as this is a meta-analytic study. Results of the analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Title: Prognostic implications of (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis (N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) PET/CT in patients with glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The potential of positron emission tomography/computed tomography using (62)Cu-diacetyl-bis (N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT), which was originally developed as a hypoxic tracer, to predict therapeutic resistance and prognosis has been reported in various cancers. Our purpose was to investigate prognostic value of (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT in patients with glioma, compared to PET/CT using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG). METHOD: 56 patients with glioma of World Health Organization grade 2-4 were enrolled. All participants had undergone both (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT within mean 33.5 days prior to treatment. Maximum standardized uptake value and tumor/background ratio were calculated within areas of increased radiotracer uptake. The prognostic significance for progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed by log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Disease progression and death were confirmed in 37 and 27 patients in follow-up periods, respectively. In univariate analysis, there was significant difference of both progression-free survival and overall survival in age, tumor grade, history of chemoradiotherapy, maximum standardized uptake value and tumor/background ratio calculated using (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT. Multivariate analysis revealed that maximum standardized uptake value calculated using (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT was an independent predictor of both progression-free survival and overall survival (p < 0.05). In a subgroup analysis including patients of grade 4 glioma, only the maximum standardized uptake values calculated using (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT showed significant difference of progression-free survival (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT is a more promising imaging method to predict prognosis of patients with glioma compared to (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

Title: Value of (18)F-FET PET in adult brainstem glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) imaging characteristics of adult brainstem glioma (BSG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: FET-PET imaging and progression-free survival (PFS) of 16 adult patients with BSG was analyzed (9 high-grade gliomas, 7 low-grade gliomas). SUV(max), TBR, and time activity curves of FET-PET were calculated. RESULTS: Progressive gliomas had higher SUV(max) (3.57 +/- 1.47 vs. 1.60 +/- 0.51; p = 0.003) and TBR(max) (3.00 +/- 1.12 vs. 1.36 +/- 0.33; p = 0.001) than stable gliomas. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed longer PFS of tumors with TBR(max) < 2.0 compared to tumors with TBR(max) > 2.0 (665 +/- 32 days versus 220 +/- 39 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FET-PET uptake might be associated with disease progression in adult BSG.

Title: Prospective trial evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET and MRI in patients with recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: Treatment-related changes can be difficult to differentiate from progressive glioma using MRI with contrast (CE). The purpose of this study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DOPA-PET and MRI in patients with recurrent glioma. Thirteen patients with MRI findings suspicious for recurrent glioma were prospectively enrolled and underwent 18F-DOPA-PET and MRI for neurosurgical planning. Stereotactic biopsies were obtained from regions of concordant and discordant PET and MRI CE, all within regions of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity. The sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DOPA-PET and CE were calculated based on histopathologic analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed optimal tumor to normal (T/N) and SUVmax thresholds. In the 37 specimens obtained, 51% exhibited MRI contrast enhancement (M+) and 78% demonstrated 18F-DOPA-PET avidity (P+). Imaging characteristics included M-P- in 16%, M-P+ in 32%, M+P+ in 46% and M+P- in 5%. Histopathologic review of biopsies revealed grade II components in 16%, grade III in 43%, grade IV in 30% and no tumor in 11%. MRI CE sensitivity for recurrent tumor was 52% and specificity was 50%. PET sensitivity for tumor was 82% and specificity was 50%. A T/N threshold > 2.0 altered sensitivity to 76% and specificity to 100% and SUVmax > 1.36 improved sensitivity and specificity to 94 and 75%, respectively. 18F-DOPA-PET can provide increased sensitivity and specificity compared with MRI CE for visualizing the spatial distribution of recurrent gliomas. Future studies will incorporate 18F-DOPA-PET into re-irradiation target volume delineation for RT planning.

Title: Addition of Amide Proton Transfer Imaging to FDG-PET/CT Improves Diagnostic Accuracy in Glioma Grading: A Preliminary Study Using the Continuous Net Reclassification Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amide proton transfer imaging has been successfully applied to brain tumors, however, the relationships between amide proton transfer and other quantitative imaging values have yet to be investigated. The aim was to examine the additive value of amide proton transfer imaging alongside [(18)F] FDG-PET and DWI for preoperative grading of gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were included in this retrospective study. All patients had undergone MR imaging, including DWI and amide proton transfer imaging on 3T scanners, and [(18)F] FDG-PET. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between each imaging parameter and the presence of high-grade (grade III and/or IV) glioma. These parameters included the tumor-to-normal ratio of FDG uptake, minimum ADC, mean amide proton transfer value, and their combinations. In each model, the overall discriminative power for the detection of high-grade glioma was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Additive information from minimum ADC and mean amide proton transfer was also evaluated by continuous net reclassification improvement. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Tumor-to-normal ratio, minimum ADC, and mean amide proton transfer demonstrated comparable diagnostic accuracy in differentiating high-grade from low-grade gliomas. When mean amide proton transfer was combined with the tumor-to-normal ratio, the continuous net reclassification improvement was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.036-1.24; P = .04) for diagnosing high-grade glioma and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.39-1.52; P = .001) for diagnosing glioblastoma. When minimum ADC was combined with the tumor-to-normal ratio, the continuous net reclassification improvement was 0.43 (95% CI, -0.17-1.04; P = .16) for diagnosing high-grade glioma, and 1.36 (95% CI, 0.79-1.92; P < .001) for diagnosing glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of amide proton transfer imaging to FDG-PET/CT may improve the ability to differentiate high-grade from low-grade gliomas.

Title: Discrimination between primary low-grade and high-grade glioma with (11)C-methionine PET: a bivariate diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of (11)C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) to discriminate between primary low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). METHODS: A systematic database search was performed by a librarian in relevant databases with the latest search on 07 November 2016. Hits were assessed for inclusion independently by two authors. Individual patient data on relative MET uptake was extracted on patients examined pre-operatively with MET PET and subsequent neuropathological diagnosis of astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. Individual patient data were analysed for diagnostic accuracy using a bivariate diagnostic random-effects meta-analysis model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation method. Bivariate meta-regression and subgroup analyses assessed study heterogeneity and validity. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016050747. RESULTS: Out of 1828 hits, 13 studies comprising of 241 individuals were included in the quantitative and qualitative analysis. MET PET had an area under the bivariate summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.78 to discriminate between LGG and HGG and a summary sensitivity of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.66-0.88) and a summary false positive rate of 0.28, 95% CI (0.19-0.38). Heterogeneity was described by; bias in patient inclusion, study quality, and ratio method. Optimal cutoff for relative MET uptake was 2.21. CONCLUSION: MET PET had a moderately high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination between primary LGG and HGG. Advances in knowledge: MET PET can be used as a clinical tool for the non-invasive discrimination between LGG and HGG with a moderately high accuracy at cut-off 2.21.

Title: Glioma Survival Prediction with Combined Analysis of In Vivo (11)C-MET PET Features, Ex Vivo Features, and Patient Features by Supervised Machine Learning.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common type of tumor in the brain. Although the definite diagnosis is routinely made ex vivo by histopathologic and molecular examination, diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected glioma is mainly done using MRI. Nevertheless, l-S-methyl-(11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET holds great potential in the characterization of gliomas. The aim of this study was to establish machine-learning-driven survival models for glioma built on in vivo (11)C-MET PET characteristics, ex vivo characteristics, and patient characteristics. Methods: The study included 70 patients with a treatment-naive glioma that was (11)C-MET-positive and had histopathology-derived ex vivo feature extraction, such as World Health Organization 2007 tumor grade, histology, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H mutational status. The (11)C-MET-positive primary tumors were delineated semiautomatically on PET images, followed by the extraction of tumor-to-background-based general and higher-order textural features by applying 5 different binning approaches. In vivo and ex vivo features, as well as patient characteristics (age, weight, height, body mass index, Karnofsky score), were merged to characterize the tumors. Machine-learning approaches were used to identify relevant in vivo, ex vivo, and patient features and their relative weights for predicting 36-mo survival. The resulting feature weights were used to establish 3 predictive models per binning configuration: one model based on a combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and clinical patient information (M36(IEP)); another based on in vivo and patient information only (M36(IP)); and a third based on in vivo information only (M36(I)). In addition, a binning-independent model based on ex vivo and patient information only (M36(EP)) was created. The established models were validated in a Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme. Results: The most prominent machine-learning-selected and -weighted features were patient-based and ex vivo-based, followed by in vivo-based. The highest areas under the curve for our models as revealed by the Monte Carlo cross-validation were 0.9 for M36(IEP), 0.87 for M36(EP), 0.77 for M36(IP), and 0.72 for M36(I)Conclusion: Prediction of survival in amino acid PET-positive glioma patients was highly accurate using computer-supported predictive models based on in vivo, ex vivo, and patient features.

Title: Recent Developments of 18F-FET PET in Neuro-oncology.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: From the past decade to date, several studies related to O-(2- [18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) in brain tumours have been published in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the recent developments and the current role of 18F-FET PET in brain tumours according to recent literature data. METHODS: Main findings from selected recently published and relevant articles on the role of 18F-FET PET in neuro-oncology are described. RESULTS: 18F-FET PET may be useful in the differential diagnosis between brain tumours and non-neoplastic lesions and between low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Integration of 18F-FET PET into surgical planning allows better delineation of the extent of resection beyond margins visible with standard MRI. For biopsy planning, 18F-FET PET is particularly useful in identifying malignant foci within non-contrast-enhancing gliomas. 18F-FET PET may improve the radiation therapy planning in patients with gliomas. This metabolic imaging method may be useful to evaluate treatment response in patients with gliomas and it improves the differential diagnosis between brain tumours recurrence and posttreatment changes. 18F-FET PET may provide useful prognostic information in high-grade gliomas. CONCLUSION: Based on recent literature data 18F-FET PET may provide additional diagnostic information compared to standard MRI in neuro-oncology.

Title: The Validation Path of Hypoxia PET Imaging: Focus on Brain Tumours.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gliomas are brain tumours arising from the glia, the supportive tissue of the central nervous system (CNS), and constitute the commonest primary malignant brain tumours. Gliomas are graded from grade I to IV according to their appearance under the microscope. One of the most significant adverse features of high-grade gliomas is hypoxia, a biological phenomenon that develops when the oxygen concentration becomes insufficient to guarantee the normal tissue functions. Since tumour hypoxia influences negatively patient outcome and targeting hypoxia has potential therapeutic implications, there is currently great interest in imaging techniques measuring hypoxia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to provide up to date evidence on the radiotracers available for measuring hypoxia in brain tumours by means of positron emission tomography (PET), the most extensively investigated imaging approach to quantify hypoxia. METHODS: The review is based on preclinical and clinical papers and describes the validation status of the different available radiotracers. RESULTS: To date, [F-18] fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) remains the most widely used radiotracer for imaging hypoxia in patients with brain tumours, but experience with other radiotracers has expanded in the last two decades. Validation of hypoxia radiotracers is still on-going and essential before these radiopharmaceuticals can become widely used in the clinical setting. CONCLUSION: Availability of a non-invasive imaging method capable of reliably measuring and mapping different levels of oxygen in brain tumours would provide the critical means of selecting patients that may benefit from tailored treatment strategies targeting hypoxia.

Title: Synergistic and targeted therapy with a procaspase-3 activator and temozolomide extends survival in glioma rodent models and is feasible for the treatment of canine malignant glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Glioblastoma is a deadly brain cancer with a median survival time of  approximately 15 months. Ionizing radiation plus the DNA alkylator temozolomide (TMZ) is the current standard therapy. PAC-1, a procaspase-3 activating small molecule, is blood-brain barrier penetrant and has previously demonstrated ability to synergize with diverse pro-apoptotic chemotherapeutics. We studied if PAC-1 could enhance the activity of TMZ, and whether addition of PAC-1 to standard treatment would be feasible in spontaneous canine malignant gliomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using cell lines and online gene expression data, we identified procaspase-3 as a potential molecular target for most glioblastomas. We investigated PAC-1 as a single agent and in combination with TMZ against glioma cells in culture and in orthotopic rodent models of glioma. Three dogs with spontaneous gliomas were treated with an analogous human glioblastoma treatment protocol, with concurrent PAC-1. RESULTS: Procaspase-3 is expressed in gliomas, with higher gene expression correlating with increased tumor grade and decreased prognosis. PAC-1 is cytotoxic to glioma cells in culture and active in orthotopic rodent glioma models. PAC-1 added to TMZ treatments in cell culture increases apoptotic death, and the combination significantly increases survival in orthotopic glioma models. Addition of PAC-1 to TMZ and radiation was well-tolerated in 3 out of 3 pet dogs with spontaneous glioma, and partial to complete tumor reductions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Procaspase-3 is a clinically relevant target for treatment of glioblastoma. Synergistic activity of PAC-1/TMZ in rodent models and the demonstration of feasibility of the combined regime in canine patients suggest potential for PAC-1 in the treatment of glioblastoma.

Title: Toxicity and efficacy of re-irradiation of high-grade glioma in a phase I dose- and volume escalation trial.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PET and MRI guided re-irradiation of recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) and to assess the impact of radiotherapy dose, fractionation and irradiated volume. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with localized, recurrent HGG (grades III-IV) and no other treatment options were eligible for a prospective phase I trial. Gross tumor volumes for radiotherapy were defined using T1-contrast enhanced MRI and (18)F-fluoro-ethyl tyrosine PET. Radiotherapy was delivered using volumetric modulated arc therapy with a 2-mm margin. The dose prescription of four consecutive groups was (1) 35 Gy/10fr., (2) 42 Gy/10fr., (3) 29.5 Gy/5fr. and (4) 35 Gy/10fr. to larger tumor volumes (100-300 cm(3)), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated of which 81% had glioblastoma. The median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95%CI: 2.1-3.5) and the median overall survival was 7.0 months (95%CI: 3.5-10.5). Early side effects were mild and included headache and fatigue. Seven patients were progression-free beyond 10 weeks and were evaluable for late toxicity. Among these patients, three (43%) suffered late adverse events which included radionecrosis and irreversible white matter changes. CONCLUSION: Re-irradiation showed limited efficacy and 43% of patients achieving disease control suffered late toxicity that was manageable but not negligible.

Title: 18F-FAZA PET/CT Hypoxia Imaging of High-Grade Glioma Before and After Radiotherapy.
Abstract: A 57 year-old man underwent MRI with dynamic susceptibility contrast and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion for neurological symptoms suggesting the diagnosis of high-grade glioma. A F-FAZA PET/CT was performed because of the enrollment in a prospective clinical trial. Subsequent radiotherapy treatment has been planned based on conventional imaging; moreover, a F-FAZA PET/CT-guided treatment planning highlighting hypoxic regions has been simulated. After radiotherapy treatment, the man underwent MRI and F-FAZA PET/CT, showing partial response.

Title: Identification of time-to-peak on dynamic 18F-FET-PET as a prognostic marker specifically in IDH1/2 mutant diffuse astrocytoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stratification of glioma according to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status has gained major importance in the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Parameters derived from uptake dynamics of 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine PET (18F-FET-PET) such as minimal time-to-peak (TTPmin) allow discrimination between different prognostic glioma subgroups, too. The present study is aimed at exploring whether TTPmin analysis provides prognostic information beyond the WHO classification. METHODS: Three hundred patients with newly diagnosed WHO 2007 grades II-IV gliomas with 18F-FET-PET imaging at diagnosis were grouped into 4 subgroups (IDH1/2 mut-1p/19q codel; IDH1/2 mut-1p/19q non-codel; IDH1/2 wildtype WHO grade II and III tumors; and glioblastoma). Clinical and imaging factors such as age, Karnofsky performance score, treatment, TTPmin, and maximal tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax) were analyzed with regard to progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS) via univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: PFS and OS were longest in the IDH1/2 mut-1p/19q codel subgroup, followed by IDH1/2 mut-1p/19q non-codel, IDH1/2 wildtype, and GBM (P < 0.001). Further, outcome stratified by TTPmin with a cutoff of 17.5 minutes revealed significantly longer PFS and OS in patients with TTPmin >17.5 minutes (P < 0.001 for PFS and OS). Lower TBRmax values or the absence of 18F-FET uptake was also associated with favorable outcome in the entire group. In the subgroup analyses, longer median TTPmin was associated with improved outcome specifically in the IDH1/2 mut-1p/19q non-codel group. CONCLUSION: 18F-FET-PET-derived dynamic analysis defines prognostically distinct subgroups of IDH1/2 mutant-1p/19q non-codel gliomas which cannot be distinguished as yet by molecular marker analysis.

Title: Utilizing 18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine positron emission tomography in high grade glioma for radiation treatment planning in patients with contraindications to MRI.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Patients with high grade glioma (HGG) and contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are dependent on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan imaging for radiation therapy (RT) target volume delineation. This study reviews the experience with the utilization of 18F-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) to define residual disease post craniotomy and optimize RT planning. METHODS: Patients with HGG and a contraindication to MRI managed with radiation therapy between 2007 and 2015 were identified. RT target volumes including gross tumour volume (GTV) defined by CT-alone and the biological target volume (BTV) defined by PET-CT were recorded. Clinical target volumes (CTV) were created from the GTV and BTV respectively using standard protocol volume expansion. The expanded BTV was termed clinical target volume biological (CTV-B). Union and intersection between CTV and CTV-B, conformity index, volumetric parameters and individual patient outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Six patients fit study criteria. There was a mean increase in CTV-B from CTV by 31.6% with a conformity index of 0.78. Two out of six patients had FET-PET avid disease outside the constructed PTV when delineated by CT-alone. One patient with CT-only planning had a new contrast-enhancing mass within 1 month of completing RT, suggesting potential geographical miss. CONCLUSION: Patients with contraindication to MRI the addition of FET-PET can improve target volume delineation for RT Planning.

Title: Brainstem pilocytic astrocytoma with H3 K27M mutation: case report.
Abstract: In this report, the authors present the first case of adult brainstem pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with the H3 K27M mutation. A 53-year-old man was incidentally found to have a 2.5-cm partially enhanced tumor in the tectum on MRI. The enhancement in the lesion increased over 3 years, and gross-total removal was performed via the occipital transtentorial approach. The resected tissue indicated PA, WHO Grade I, and genetic analysis revealed the H3 K27M mutation. However, although the radiological, surgical, and pathological findings all corresponded to PA, this entity can easily be misdiagnosed as diffuse midline glioma with the H3 K27M mutation, which is classified as a WHO Grade IV tumor according to the updated classification. This case highlights the phenotypic spectrum of PA, as well as the biology of the H3 K27M-mutated gliomas, and may prove to be an exception to the rule that diffuse midline gliomas with the H3 K27M mutation behave in an aggressive manner. Based on the findings of this case, the authors conclude that, in addition to detecting the existence of the H3 K27M mutation, an integrated approach in which a combination of clinical, pathological, and genetic information is used should be applied for accurate diagnosis and determination of the appropriate treatment for diffuse midline gliomas.

Title: PET for Therapy Response Assessment in Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant and the most common type of glioma in adults, accounting for 60-70% of all malignant gliomas. Despite the current therapy, the clinical course of GB is usually rapid, with a mean survival time of approximately 1 year. For therapy response assessment in GB, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice. In 2010, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) was introduced, including the tumor size (in 2D) as measured on T2-weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)-weighted images, in addition to the contrast-enhancing tumor part. Although the RANO criteria addressed some of the limitations of the previous MacDonald criteria for therapy evaluation in high-grade glioma, treatment-related side effects hamper correct response assessment. To address the above-mentioned drawbacks in the follow-up of GB, incorporating changes in tumor biology measured by advanced MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which may precede anatomical changes of the tumor volume, is promising. Imaging biomarkers capable of predicting response at an early time point after treatment initiation are the premise of personalized treatment enabling change or discontinuation of therapy to prevent ineffective treatment or adverse events of treatment. In this chapter, an overview of applicable PET tracers for the therapy response assessment in GB and the determination of tumor recurrence versus treatment-related effects is given.

Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of Neuroimaging to Delineate Diffuse Gliomas within the Brain: A Meta-Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Brain imaging in diffuse glioma is used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up. PURPOSE: In this meta-analysis, we address the diagnostic accuracy of imaging to delineate diffuse glioma. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched studies of adults with diffuse gliomas and correlation of imaging with histopathology. STUDY SELECTION: Study inclusion was based on quality criteria. Individual patient data were used, if available. DATA ANALYSIS: A hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic method was applied. Low- and high-grade gliomas were analyzed in subgroups. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one studies described 3532 samples in 1309 patients. The mean Standard for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy score (13/25) indicated suboptimal reporting quality. For diffuse gliomas as a whole, the diagnostic accuracy was best with T2-weighted imaging, measured as area under the curve, false-positive rate, true-positive rate, and diagnostic odds ratio of 95.6%, 3.3%, 82%, and 152. For low-grade gliomas, the diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted imaging as a reference was 89.0%, 0.4%, 44.7%, and 205; and for high-grade gliomas, with T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging as a reference, it was 80.7%, 16.8%, 73.3%, and 14.8. In high-grade gliomas, MR spectroscopy (85.7%, 35.0%, 85.7%, and 12.4) and (11)C methionine-PET (85.1%, 38.7%, 93.7%, and 26.6) performed better than the reference imaging. LIMITATIONS: True-negative samples were underrepresented in these data, so false-positive rates are probably less reliable than true-positive rates. Multimodality imaging data were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used imaging is better for delineation of low-grade gliomas than high-grade gliomas on the basis of limited evidence. Improvement is indicated from advanced techniques, such as MR spectroscopy and PET.

Title: Peptide-based PET imaging of the tumor restricted IL13RA2 biomarker.
Abstract: Peptides that target cancer cell surface receptors are promising platforms to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic payloads specifically to cancer but not normal tissue. IL13RA2 is a tumor-restricted receptor found to be present in several aggressive malignancies, including in the vast majority of high-grade gliomas and malignant melanoma. This receptor has been successfully targeted for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes using modified IL-13 ligand and more recently using a specific peptide, Pep-1L. In the current work, we establish the in vitro and in vivo tumor binding properties of radiolabeled Pep-1L, designed for tumor imaging. We radiolabeled Pep-1L with Copper-64 and demonstrated specific cell uptake in the IL13RA2-over expressing G48 glioblastoma cell line having abundant IL13RA2 expression. [(64)Cu]Pep-1L binding was blocked by unlabeled ligand, demonstrating specificity. To demonstrate in vivo tumor uptake, we intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice and demonstrated that [(64)Cu]Pep-1L specifically bound tumors at 24 hours, which was significantly blocked (3-fold) by pre-injecting unlabeled peptide. To further demonstrate specificity of Pep-1L towards IL13RA2 in vivo, we exploited an IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumor model that does not express receptor at baseline but expresses abundant receptor after treatment with doxycycline. We injected [(64)Cu]Pep-1L into mice bearing IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumors and performed in vivo PET/CT and post-necropsy biodistribution studies and found that tumors that were induced to express IL13RA2 receptor by doxycycline pretreatment bound radiolabeled Pep-1L 3-4 fold greater than uninduced tumors, demonstrating receptor specificity. This work demonstrates that [(64)Cu]Pep-1L selectively binds hIL13RA2-expressing tumors and validates Pep-1L as an effective platform to deliver diagnostics and therapeutics to IL13RA2-expressing cancers.

Title: Whole-tumor histogram analysis of the cerebral blood volume map: tumor volume defined by 11C-methionine positron emission tomography image improves the diagnostic accuracy of cerebral glioma grading.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the tumor volume definition using conventional magnetic resonance (MR) and 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET/PET) images in the differentiation of the pre-operative glioma grade by using whole-tumor histogram analysis of normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) maps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with histopathologically proven primary brain low-grade gliomas (n = 15) and high-grade gliomas (n = 19) underwent pre-operative or pre-biopsy MET/PET, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted at 3.0 T. The histogram distribution derived from the nCBV maps was obtained by co-registering the whole tumor volume delineated on conventional MR or MET/PET images, and eight histogram parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The mean nCBV value had the highest AUC value (0.906) based on MET/PET images. Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved when the tumor volume was measured from MET/PET images compared with conventional MR images for the parameters of mean, 50th, and 75th percentile nCBV value (p = 0.0246, 0.0223, and 0.0150, respectively). CONCLUSION: Whole-tumor histogram analysis of CBV map provides more valuable histogram parameters and increases diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation of pre-operative cerebral gliomas when the tumor volume is derived from MET/PET images.

Title: Spatial Relationship of Glioma Volume Derived from (18)F-FET PET and Volumetric MR Spectroscopy Imaging: A Hybrid PET/MRI Study.
Abstract: PET imaging of amino acid transport using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) imaging of cell turnover measured by the ratio of choline to N-acetyl-aspartate (Cho/NAA) may provide additional information on tumor extent of cerebral gliomas compared with anatomic imaging; however, comparative studies are rare. Methods: In this prospective study, 41 patients (16 women, 25 men; mean age +/- SD, 48 +/- 14 y) with cerebral gliomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II: 10 [including 1 patient with 2 lesions], WHO III: 17, WHO IV: 13, without biopsy low-grade: 1, high-grade: 1) were investigated with a hybrid PET/MR scanner. Tumor extent, spatial overlap, and the distance between the corresponding centers of mass in (18)F-FET PET and MRS imaging of Cho/NAA, determined by simultaneously acquired, 3-dimensional spatially resolved MRS imaging data, were compared. Results: The average tumor volumes for (18)F-FET uptake and increased Cho/NAA were 19 +/- 20 cm(3) (mean +/- SD) and 22 +/- 24 cm(3), respectively, with an overlap of 40% +/- 25% and separation of the centers of mass by 9 +/- 8 mm. None of the parameters showed a significant correlation with tumor grade. Conclusion:(18)F-FET uptake and increased Cho/NAA ratio are not always congruent and may represent different properties of glioma metabolism. The relationship to histologic tumor extent needs to be further analyzed.

Title: Multimodal (18)F-Fluciclovine PET/MRI and Ultrasound-Guided Neurosurgery of an Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathologic tissue sampling are routinely performed as part of the diagnostic workup for patients with glioma. Because of the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, there is a risk of undergrading caused by histopathologic sampling errors. MRI has limitations in identifying tumor grade and type, detecting diffuse invasive growth, and separating recurrences from treatment induced changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) can provide quantitative information of cellular activity and metabolism, and may therefore complement MRI. In this report, we present the first patient with brain glioma examined with simultaneous PET/MRI using the amino acid tracer (18)F-fluciclovine ((18)F-FACBC) for intraoperative image-guided surgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 60-year old woman was admitted to the emergency care with speech difficulties and a mild left-sided hemiparesis. MRI revealed a tumor that was suggestive of glioma. Before surgery, the patient underwent a simultaneous PET/MRI examination. Fused PET/MRI, T1, FLAIR, and intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound images were used to guide histopathologic tissue sampling and surgical resection. Navigated, image-guided histopathologic samples were compared with PET/MRI image data to assess the additional value of the PET acquisition. Histopathologic analysis showed anaplastic oligodendroglioma in the most malignant parts of the tumor, while several regions were World Health Organization (WHO) grade II. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-Fluciclovine uptake was found in parts of the tumor where regional WHO grade, cell proliferation, and cell densities were highest. This finding suggests that PET/MRI with this tracer could be used to improve accuracy in histopathologic tissue sampling and grading, and possibly for guiding treatments targeting the most malignant part of extensive and eloquent gliomas.

Title: Diagnostic Performance and Safety of Positron Emission Tomography Using (18)F-Fluciclovine in Patients with Clinically Suspected High- or Low-grade Gliomas: A Multicenter Phase IIb Trial.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to assess the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography (PET) for gliomas using the novel tracer (18)F-fluciclovine (anti-[(18)F]FACBC) and to evaluate the safety of this tracer in patients with clinically suspected gliomas. METHODS: Anti-[(18)F]FACBC was administered to 40 patients with clinically suspected high- or low-grade gliomas, followed by PET imaging. T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (or T2-weighted) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to plan for the tissue collection. Tissues were collected from either "areas visualized using anti-[(18)F]FACBC PET imaging but not using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging" or "areas visualized using both anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging" and were histopathologically examined to assess the diagnostic accuracy of anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET for gliomas. RESULTS: The positive predictive value of anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET imaging for glioma in areas visualized using anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET imaging, but not visualized using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, was 100.0% (26/26), and the value in areas visualized using both contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging and anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET imaging was 87.5% (7/8). Twelve adverse events occurred in 7 (17.5%) of the 40 patients who received anti-[(18)F]FACBC. Five events in five patients were considered to be adverse drug reactions; however, none of the events were serious, and all except one resolved spontaneously without treatment. CONCLUSION: This Phase IIb trial showed that anti-[(18)F]FACBC-PET imaging was effective for the detection of gliomas in areas not visualized using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI and the tracer was well tolerated.

Title: Comparison of (18)F-FET PET and perfusion-weighted MRI for glioma grading: a hybrid PET/MR study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Both perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI) and O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET ((18)F-FET) provide grading information in cerebral gliomas. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of (18)F-FET PET and PWI for tumor grading in a series of patients with newly diagnosed, untreated gliomas using an integrated PET/MR scanner. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with untreated gliomas [22 low-grade gliomas (LGG), and 50 high-grade gliomas (HGG)] were investigated with (18)F-FET PET and PWI using a hybrid PET/MR scanner. After visual inspection of PET and PWI maps (rCBV, rCBF, MTT), volumes of interest (VOIs) with a diameter of 16 mm were centered upon the maximum of abnormality in the tumor area in each modality and the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Mean and maximum tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR(mean), TBR(max)) were calculated. In addition, Time-to-Peak (TTP) and slopes of time-activity curves were calculated for (18)F-FET PET. Diagnostic accuracies of (18)F-FET PET and PWI for differentiating low-grade glioma (LGG) from high-grade glioma (HGG) were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses (area under the curve; AUC). RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FET PET and PWI to discriminate LGG from HGG was similar with highest AUC values for TBR(mean) and TBR(max) of (18)F-FET PET uptake (0.80, 0.83) and for TBR(mean) and TBR(max) of rCBV (0.80, 0.81). In case of increased signal in the tumor area with both methods (n = 32), local hot-spots were incongruent in 25 patients (78%) with a mean distance of 10.6 +/- 9.5 mm. Dynamic FET PET and combination of different parameters did not further improve diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Both (18)F-FET PET and PWI discriminate LGG from HGG with similar diagnostic performance. Regional abnormalities in the tumor area are usually not congruent indicating that tumor grading by (18)F-FET PET and PWI is based on different pathophysiological phenomena.

Title: Differential diagnosis of posterior fossa brain tumors: Multiple discriminant analysis of Tl-SPECT and FDG-PET.
Abstract: This study investigated the combined capability of thallium-201 (Tl)-SPECT and fluorine-18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET for differential diagnosis of posterior fossa brain tumors using multiple discriminant analysis.This retrospective study was conducted under approval of the institutional review board. In the hospital information system, 27 patients with posterior fossa intra-axial tumor between January 2009 and June 2015 were enrolled and grouped as the following 7 entities: low grade glioma (LGG) 6, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) 2, glioblastoma (GBM) 3, medulloblastoma (MB) 3, hemangioblastoma (HB) 6, metastatic tumor (Mets) 3, and malignant lymphoma (ML) 4. Tl and FDG uptakes were measured at the tumors and control areas, and several indexes were derived. Using indexes selected by the stepwise method, discriminant analysis was conducted with leave-one-out cross-validation.The predicted accuracy for tumor classification was 70.4% at initial analysis and 55.6% at cross-validation to differentiate 7 tumor entities. HB, LGG, and ML were well-discriminated, but AA was located next to LGG. GBM, MB, and Mets largely overlapped and could not be well distinguished even applying multiple discriminant analysis. Correct classification in the original and cross-validation analyses was 44.4% and 33.3% for Tl-SPECT and 55.6% and 48.1% for FDG-PET.

Title: Characterizing hypoxia in human glioma: A simultaneous multimodal MRI and PET study.
Abstract: Hypoxia plays an important role for the prognosis and therapy response of cancer. Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[(18) F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([(18) F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T(2) , T(2) * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [(18) F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([(18) F]-FMISO(120-130 min) ), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [(18) F]-FMISO-k(3) , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [(18) F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [(18) F]-FMISO(120-130 min) concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T(1) -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [(18) F]-FMISO(120-130 min) as well as [(18) F]-FMISO-k(3) , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [(18) F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [(18) F]-FMISO-k(3) was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [(18) F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence. Overall, the two methods appear to rather provide complementary than redundant information about high-grade glioma biology.

Title: Delivering FLT to the Central Nervous System by Means of a Promising Targeting System: Synthesis, [(11)C]Radiosynthesis, and in Vivo Evaluation.
Abstract: The development of delivery systems to transport some specific radiotracers across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) needs to be investigated for brain imaging. [(18)F]FLT (3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluoro-l-thymidine), an analogue substrate of the nucleoside thymidine, has been developed as a proliferation tracer for oncological PET studies. Unfortunately, low-grade brain tumors are poorly visualized due to the low uptake of [(18)F]FLT in brain tissue, preventing its use in PET imaging to detect brain tumors at an early stage. Based on our previous work, a redox chemical delivery system (CDS) related to Bodor's strategy was developed to enable the penetration of FLT into the brain. To this end, FLT was covalently linked to a series of lipophilic carriers based on a 1,4-dihydroquinoline structure. To determine the best carrier, various sets of [(11)C]CDS-FLT were prepared and injected into rats. Pleasingly, in vivo results let us suggest that this CDS is a promising approach to overcome the BBB to target low-grade brain tumors for PET imaging.

Title: Grading and outcome prediction of pediatric diffuse astrocytic tumors with diffusion and arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI in comparison with 18F-DOPA PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate MRI-derived diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging in comparison with (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) PET with respect to diagnostic performance in tumor grading and outcome prediction in pediatric patients with diffuse astrocytic tumors (DAT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 26 children with histologically proven treatment naive low and high grade DAT who underwent ASL and DWI performed within 2 weeks of (18)F-DOPA PET. Relative ASL-derived cerebral blood flow max (rCBF max) and DWI-derived minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC min) were compared with (18)F-DOPA uptake tumor/normal tissue (T/N) and tumor/striatum (T/S) ratios, and correlated with World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade and progression-free survival (PFS). Statistics included Pearson's chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman's rank correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, discriminant function analysis (DFA), Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and Cox analysis. RESULTS: A significant correlation was demonstrated between rCBF max, rADC min, and (18)F-DOPA PET data (p < 0.001). Significant differences in terms of rCBF max, rADC min, and (18)F-DOPA uptake were found between low- and high-grade DAT (p </= 0.001). ROC analysis and DFA demonstrated that T/S and T/N values were the best parameters for predicting tumor progression (AUC 0.93, p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, all diagnostic tools correlated with PFS (p </= 0.001); however, on multivariate analysis, only (18)F-DOPA uptake remained significantly associated with outcome (p </= 0.03), while a trend emerged for rCBF max (p = 0.09) and rADC min (p = 0.08). The combination of MRI and PET data increased the predictive power for prognosticating tumor progression (AUC 0.97, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DWI, ASL and (18)F-DOPA PET provide useful complementary information for pediatric DAT grading. (18)F-DOPA uptake better correlates with PFS prediction. Combining MRI and PET data provides the highest predictive power for prognosticating tumor progression suggesting a synergistic role of these diagnostic tools.

Title: Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Imaging With [18F]DCFPyL in High-Grade Gliomas.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas (World Health Organization grade III-IV) are highly lethal primary brain tumors. Imaging modalities, including MRI and FDG PET, provide a limited ability to differentiate treatment effects (such as radiation necrosis) from recurrent or residual tumor. As the first step in validating the applicability of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted imaging in high-grade gliomas, we evaluated the ability of the PSMA-targeted small molecule [F]DCFPyL (2-(3-(1carboxy-5-(6-[F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid) to image high-grade gliomas in a series of 3 prospectively recruited patients. We found [F]DCFPyL binds PSMA in the neovasculature of glioblastoma multiforme and tumor cells of anaplastic astrocytoma.

Title: Late post-treatment radiographic changes 3 years following chemoradiation for glioma: the importance of histopathology.
Abstract: Treatment-related changes can mimic brain tumor progression both clinically and radiographically. Distinguishing these two entities represents a major challenge in neuro-oncology. No single imaging modality is capable of reliably achieving such distinction. While histopathology remains the gold standard, definitive pathological criteria are also lacking which can further complicate such cases. We report a patient with high-grade glioma who, after initially presenting with histopathologically confirmed pseudoprogression 10 months following treatment, re-presented 3 years following concurrent chemoradiation with clinical and radiographic changes that were most consistent with progressive disease but for which histopathology revealed treatment effects without active glioma. This case highlights the potential late onset of treatment-related changes and underscores the importance of histopathologic assessment even years following initial therapy.

Title: Diagnosis of Brain Tumors Using Amino Acid Transport PET Imaging with (18)F-fluciclovine: A Comparative Study with L-methyl-(11)C-methionine PET Imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: (18)F-fluciclovine (trans-1-amino-3-[(18)F] fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid, [FACBC]) is an artificial amino acid radiotracer used for positron emission tomography (PET) studies, which is metabolically stable in vivo and has a long half-life. It has already been shown that FACBC-PET is useful for glioma imaging. However, there have been no reports evaluating the efficiency of FACBC-PET in the diagnosis of brain tumors in comparison with other PET tracers in clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of FACBC-PET imaging in glioma diagnosis, compared to L-methyl- ((11)) C-methionine (MET)-PET. METHODS: Six consecutive patients (four male, two female), who were clinically suspected of having high- or low-grade glioma, received both FACBC-PET and MET-PET within a two-week interval. T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assist with subsequent tissue resection. Visual findings and semi-quantitative analyses of FACBC and MET uptake, using standardized uptake values (SUVs) and lesion-to-contralateral normal brain tissue (LN) ratios, were evaluated to compare PET images. RESULTS: SUVs for FACBC were lower than those for MET in the non-lesion cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellar hemisphere. There was a weak positive correlation between FACBC and MET uptake in glioma tissue, although L/N ratios for FACBC were higher than those for MET in all the cases. CONCLUSION: FACBC-PET showed higher contrast than MET-PET by both visual and semi-quantitative analyses and may therefore provide better assessment for the detection of glioma. This study was registered as clinical trial (No. JapicCTI-132289).

Title: Multimodal Imaging of Patients With Gliomas Confirms (11)C-MET PET as a Complementary Marker to MRI for Noninvasive Tumor Grading and Intraindividual Follow-Up After Therapy.
Abstract: The value of combined L-( methyl-[(11)C]) methionine positron-emitting tomography (MET-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with regard to tumor extent, entity prediction, and therapy effects in clinical routine in patients with suspicion of a brain tumor was investigated. In n = 65 patients with histologically verified brain lesions n = 70 MET-PET and MRI (T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced [T1w-Gd] and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery or T2-weighted [FLAIR/T2w]) examinations were performed. The computer software "visualization and analysis framework volume rendering engine (Voreen)" was used for analysis of extent and intersection of tumor compartments. Binary logistic regression models were developed to differentiate between World Health Organization (WHO) tumor types/grades. Tumor sizes as defined by thresholding based on tumor-to-background ratios were significantly different as determined by MET-PET (21.6 +/- 36.8 cm(3)), T1w-Gd-MRI (3.9 +/- 7.8 cm(3)), and FLAIR/T2-MRI (64.8 +/- 60.4 cm(3); P < .001). The MET-PET visualized tumor activity where MRI parameters were negative: PET positive tumor volume without Gd enhancement was 19.8 +/- 35.0 cm(3) and without changes in FLAIR/T2 10.3 +/- 25.7 cm(3). FLAIR/T2-MRI visualized greatest tumor extent with differences to MET-PET being greater in posttherapy (64.6 +/- 62.7 cm(3)) than in newly diagnosed patients (20.5 +/- 52.6 cm(3)). The binary logistic regression model differentiated between WHO tumor types (fibrillary astrocytoma II n = 10 from other gliomas n = 16) with an accuracy of 80.8% in patients at primary diagnosis. Combined PET and MRI improve the evaluation of tumor activity, extent, type/grade prediction, and therapy-induced changes in patients with glioma and serve information highly relevant for diagnosis and management.

Title: Clinical value of fluorine-18alpha-methyltyrosine PET in patients with gliomas: comparison with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between metabolic activity and histological features of gliomas using fluorine-18alpha-methyltyrosine ((18)F-FAMT) positron emission tomography (PET) compared with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET in 38 consecutive glioma patients. The tumor to normal brain ratios (T/N ratios) were calculated, and the relationships between T/N ratio and World Health Organization tumor grade or MIB-1 labeling index were evaluated. The diagnostic values of T/N ratios were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to differentiate between high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). RESULTS: Median T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was 2.85, 4.65, and 4.09 for grade II, III, and IV gliomas, respectively, with significant differences between HGGs and LGGs (p = 0.006). Both T/N ratio (p = 0.016) and maximum standardized uptake value (p = 0.033) of (18)F-FDG PET showed significant differences between HGGs and LGGs. ROC analysis yielded an optimal cut-off of 3.37 for the T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET to differentiate between HGGs and LGGs (sensitivity 81%, specificity 67%, accuracy 76%, area under the ROC curve 0.776). Positive predictive value was 84%, and negative predictive value was 62%. T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was not correlated with MIB-1 labeling index in all gliomas, whereas T/N ratio of (18)F-FDG PET was positively correlated (r (s)  = 0.400, p = 0.013). Significant positive correlation was observed between T/N ratios of (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FAMT (r (s)  = 0.454, p = 0.004), but median T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT PET was significantly higher than that of (18)F-FDG PET in all grades of glioma. CONCLUSIONS: The T/N ratio of (18)F-FAMT uptake has high positive predictive value for detection of HGGs. (18)F-FAMT PET had higher T/N ratio, with better tumor-normal brain contrast, compared to (18)F-FDG PET in both LGGs and HGGs. Therefore, (18)F-FAMT is a useful radiotracer for the preoperative visualization of gliomas.

Title: Glioma FMISO PET/MR Imaging Concurrent with Antiangiogenic Therapy: Molecular Imaging as a Clinical Tool in the Burgeoning Era of Personalized Medicine.
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide a focused overview of the current use of positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging in the burgeoning era of personalized medicine in the treatment of patients with glioma. Specifically, we demonstrate the utility of PET imaging as a tool for personalized diagnosis and therapy by highlighting a case series of four patients with recurrent high grade glioma who underwent 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET/MR (magnetic resonance) imaging through the course of antiangiogenic therapy. Three distinct features were observed from this small cohort of patients. First, the presence of pseudoprogression was retrospectively associated with the absence of hypoxia. Second, a subgroup of patients with recurrent high grade glioma undergoing bevacizumab therapy demonstrated disease progression characterized by an enlarging nonenhancing mass with newly developed reduced diffusion, lack of hypoxia, and preserved cerebral blood volume. Finally, a reduction in hypoxic volume was observed concurrent with therapy in all patients with recurrent tumor, and markedly so in two patients that developed a nonenhancing reduced diffusion mass. This case series demonstrates how medical imaging has the potential to influence personalized medicine in several key aspects, especially involving molecular PET imaging for personalized diagnosis, patient specific disease prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring.

Title: Correlation between hypoxic area in primary brain tumors and WHO grade: differentiation from malignancy using 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography.
Abstract: Background 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography (FMISO-PET) has been used for identification of hypoxic areas in tumors, and since hypoxia causes hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and enhancement of tumor growth, identifying the hypoxic area in the tumor tissue is important. Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of FMISO-PET in the grading of primary brain tumors. Material and Methods FMISO-PET was performed preoperatively on 41 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed brain tumor. A neuroradiologist retrospectively measured both maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean SUV (SUVmean) in the tumor and normal cerebellar parenchyma. Maximum tumor/normal control ratio (T/Nmax) and mean tumor/normal control ratio (T/Nmean) were calculated and analyzed. Results There was a positive correlation between World Health Organization (WHO) grade and both T/Nmax and T/Nmean (r = 0.731 and 0.713, respectively). When all cases were divided into benign (WHO grade II) and malignant groups (III and IV), there were significant differences between the two groups in both T/Nmax and T/Nmean ( P < 0.001). If the cutoff value was defined as T/Nmax = 1.25 and T/Nmean = 1.23, T/Nmax had a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 90.9% while T/Nmean had a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 90.9% in differentiating the benign group from the malignant group. Conclusion Both T/Nmax and T/Nmean in FMISO-PET have a positive correlation with primary brain tumor grading, making FMISO-PET useful in diagnosing the malignancy of primary brain tumors.

Title: An Update on the Approach to the Imaging of Brain Tumors.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroimaging plays a critical role in diagnosis of brain tumors and in assessment of response to therapy. However, challenges remain, including accurately and reproducibly assessing response to therapy, defining endpoints for neuro-oncology trials, providing prognostic information, and differentiating progressive disease from post-therapeutic changes particularly in the setting of antiangiogenic and other novel therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in the imaging of brain tumors include application of advanced MRI imaging techniques to assess tumor response to therapy and analysis of imaging features correlating to molecular markers, grade, and prognosis. This review aims to summarize recent advances in imaging as applied to current diagnostic and therapeutic neuro-oncologic challenges.

Title: Clinical Utility of Positron Emission Tomography in Patients with Malignant Glioma.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is being increasingly utilized for the management of brain tumors. Herein, we primarily review our previous studies on the use of PET in glioma that utilize three types of tracers: (11)C-methionine (MET), (11)C-choline, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose. These studies included aspects such as tumor behavior, diagnosis, grade of malignancy, spread and invasion, viability, and genetic deletions; moreover, they also evaluated PET as a tool for planning radiation therapy (RT) and determining its outcome. MET-PET in particular is considered to be the most informative for diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for glioma patients; it is therefore considered crucial for brain tumor therapy. MET-PET is expected to be widely used for brain tumor patients going forward.

Title: Timed sequential therapy of the selective T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil and temozolomide in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mibefradil (MIB), previously approved for treatment of hypertension, is a selective T-type calcium channel blocker with preclinical activity in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). To exploit its presumed mechanism of impacting cell cycle activity (G1 arrest), we designed a phase I study to determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MIB when given sequentially with temozolomide (TMZ) in recurrent (r)HGG. METHODS: Adult patients with rHGG >/=3 months from TMZ for initial therapy received MIB in 4 daily doses (q.i.d.) for 7 days followed by standard TMZ at 150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days per 28-day cycle. MIB dose escalation followed a modified 3 + 3 design, with an extension cohort of 10 patients at MTD who underwent 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) PET imaging, to image proliferation before and after 7 days of MIB. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (20 World Health Organization grade IV, 7 grade III; median age 50 y; median KPS 90). The MTD of MIB was 87.5 mg p.o. q.i.d. Dose-limiting toxicities were elevation of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (grade 3) and sinus bradycardia. The steady-state maximum plasma concentration of MIB at the MTD was 1693 +/- 287 ng/mL (mean +/- SD). 18F-FLT PET imaging showed a significant decline in standardized uptake value (SUV) signal in 2 of 10 patients after 7 days of treatment with MIB. CONCLUSIONS: MIB followed by TMZ was well tolerated in rHGG patients at the MTD. The lack of toxicity and presence of some responses in this selected patient population suggest that this regimen warrants further investigation.

Title: Correlation of (18)F-FDG PET and MRI Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Histogram Metrics with Survival in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma: A Report from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to describe baseline (18)F-FDG PET voxel characteristics in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and to correlate these metrics with baseline MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram metrics, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival. Methods: Baseline brain (18)F-FDG PET and MRI scans were obtained in 33 children from Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium clinical DIPG trials. (18)F-FDG PET images, postgadolinium MR images, and ADC MR images were registered to baseline fluid attenuation inversion recovery MR images. Three-dimensional regions of interest on fluid attenuation inversion recovery MR images and postgadolinium MR images and (18)F-FDG PET and MR ADC histograms were generated. Metrics evaluated included peak number, skewness, and kurtosis. Correlation between PET and MR ADC histogram metrics was evaluated. PET pixel values within the region of interest for each tumor were plotted against MR ADC values. The association of these imaging markers with survival was described. Results: PET histograms were almost always unimodal (94%, vs. 6% bimodal). None of the PET histogram parameters (skewness or kurtosis) had a significant association with PFS, although a higher PET postgadolinium skewness tended toward a less favorable PFS (hazard ratio, 3.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-16.28 [P = 0.11]). There was a significant association between higher MR ADC postgadolinium skewness and shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.11-5.91 [P = 0.028]), and there was the suggestion that this also led to shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.95-5.04 [P = 0.067]). Higher MR ADC postgadolinium kurtosis tended toward shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.98-1.74 [P = 0.073]). PET and MR ADC pixel values were negatively correlated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Further, the level of PET and MR ADC correlation was significantly positively associated with PFS; tumors with higher values of ADC-PET correlation had more favorable PFS (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.89 [P = 0.036]), suggesting that a higher level of negative ADC-PET correlation leads to less favorable PFS. A more significant negative correlation may indicate higher-grade elements within the tumor leading to poorer outcomes. Conclusion:(18)F-FDG PET and MR ADC histogram metrics in pediatric DIPG demonstrate different characteristics with often a negative correlation between PET and MR ADC pixel values. A higher negative correlation is associated with a worse PFS, which may indicate higher-grade elements within the tumor.

Title: Multiparametric Evaluation in Differentiating Glioma Recurrence from Treatment-Induced Necrosis Using Simultaneous (18)F-FDG-PET/MRI: A Single-Institution Retrospective Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiating glioma recurrence from treatment-induced necrosis can be a challenge on conventional imaging. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of each functional MR imaging and PET parameter derived by using simultaneous FDG-PET/MR imaging individually and in combination in the evaluation of suspected glioma recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five treated glioma patients with 41 enhancing lesions (World Health Organization grade II = 9, III = 13, IV = 19) on MR imaging after an operation followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy formed part of this study. Using PET/MR imaging, we calculated the normalized mean relative CBV, mean ADC, Cho/Cr, and maximum and mean target-to-background ratios. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic performance of each parameter by receiver operating characteristic analysis individually and in combination with multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of glioma recurrence. Histopathology or clinicoradiologic follow-up was considered the criterion standard. RESULTS: Of 35 patients, 25 (30 lesions) were classified as having a recurrence and 10 (11 lesions) patients as having treatment-induced necrosis. Parameters like rCBV(mean) (mean relative CBV), ADC(mean), Cho/Cr, and maximum and mean target-to-background ratios were statistically significant in the detection of recurrent lesions with an accuracy of 77.5%, 78.0%, 90.9%, 87.8%, and 87.8%, respectively. On multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis, the combination of all 3 MR imaging parameters resulted in an area under the curve of 0.913 +/- 0.053. Furthermore, an area under the curve of 0.935 +/- 0.046 was obtained when MR imaging parameters (ADC(mean) and Cho/Cr) were combined with the PET parameter (mean target-to-background ratio), demonstrating an increase in diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous PET/MR imaging with FDG offers correlative and synergistic multiparametric assessment of glioma recurrence with increased accuracy and clinical utility.

Title: 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT, Brain MRI, and 5-Aminolevulinic Acid for the Assessment of Tumor Resection in High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: High-grade glioma is a very aggressive and infiltrative tumor in which complete resection is a chance for a better outcome. We present the case of a 57-year-old man with a brain lesion suggestive of high-grade glioma. Brain MRI and F-fluorocholine PET/CT were performed previously to plan the surgery. Surgery was microscope assisted after the administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid. Postsurgery brain MRI and PET were blind evaluated to the surgery results and reported as probably gross total resection.

Title: [18F]-FMISO PET study of hypoxia in gliomas before surgery: correlation with molecular markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Hypoxia in gliomas is associated with tumor resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. However, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hypoxia remains challenging, and the validation of biological markers is, therefore, of great importance. We investigated the relationship between uptake of the PET hypoxia tracer [18F]-FMISO and other markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis and with patient survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective single center clinical study, 33 glioma patients (grade IV: n = 24, III: n = 3, and II: n = 6) underwent [18F]-FMISO PET and MRI including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps before surgery. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and hypoxic volume were calculated, defining two groups of patients based on the presence or absence of [18F]-FMISO uptake. After surgery, molecular quantification of CAIX, VEGF, Ang2 (rt-qPCR), and HIF-1alpha (immunohistochemistry) were performed on tumor specimens. RESULTS: [18F]-FMISO PET uptake was closely linked to tumor grade, with high uptake in glioblastomas (GB, grade IV). Expression of biomarkers of hypoxia (CAIX, HIF-1alpha), and angiogenesis markers (VEGF, Ang2, rCBV) were significantly higher in the [18F]-FMISO uptake group. We found correlations between the degree of hypoxia (hypoxic volume and SUVmax) and expression of HIF-1alpha, CAIX, VEGF, Ang2, and rCBV (p < 0.01). Patients without [18F]-FMISO uptake had a longer survival time than uptake positive patients (log-rank, p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor hypoxia as evaluated by [18F]-FMISO PET is associated with the expression of hypoxia markers on a molecular level and is related to angiogenesis. [18F]-FMISO uptake is a mark of an aggressive tumor, almost always a glioblastoma. Our results underline that [18F]-FMISO PET could be useful to guide glioma treatment, and in particular radiotherapy, since hypoxia is a well-known factor of resistance.

Title: An MRS- and PET-guided biopsy tool for intraoperative neuronavigational systems.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Glioma heterogeneity and the limitations of conventional structural MRI for identifying aggressive tumor components can limit the reliability of stereotactic biopsy and, hence, tumor characterization, which is a hurdle for developing and selecting effective treatment strategies. In vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) and PET enable noninvasive imaging of cellular metabolism relevant to proliferation and can detect regions of more highly active tumor. Here, the authors integrated presurgical PET and MRS with intraoperative neuronavigation to guide surgical biopsy and tumor sampling of brain gliomas with the aim of improving intraoperative tumor-tissue characterization and imaging biomarker validation. METHODS A novel intraoperative neuronavigation tool was developed as part of a study that aimed to sample high-choline tumor components identified by multivoxel MRS and (18)F-methylcholine PET-CT. Spatially coregistered PET and MRS data were integrated into structural data sets and loaded onto an intraoperative neuronavigation system. High and low choline uptake/metabolite regions were represented as color-coded hollow spheres for targeted stereotactic biopsy and tumor sampling. RESULTS The neurosurgeons found the 3D spherical targets readily identifiable on the interactive neuronavigation system. In one case, areas of high mitotic activity were identified on the basis of high (18)F-methylcholine uptake and elevated choline ratios found with MRS in an otherwise low-grade tumor, which revealed the possible use of this technique for tumor characterization. CONCLUSIONS These PET and MRI data can be combined and represented usefully for the surgeon in neuronavigation systems. This method enables neurosurgeons to sample tumor regions based on physiological and molecular imaging markers. The technique was applied for characterizing choline metabolism using MRS and (18)F PET; however, this approach provides proof of principle for using different radionuclide tracers and other MRI methods, such as MR perfusion and diffusion.

Title: The usefulness of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in the detection of recurrence of central nervous system primary neoplasms.
Abstract: AIM: To study the usefulness of (18)F-fluorocholine (FCH) in detecting the recurrence of primary brain tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on brain PET/CT with FCH for compassionate use in 21 patients with suspected recurrence of a primary brain tumour. The distribution by pathology was: three grade ii astrocytomas, three grade iii astrocytomas, one grade ii oligodendroglioma, three grade iii oligodendrogliomas, one grade iii oligoastrocytoma, four glioblastoma multiform, one gliomatosis cerebri, and five meningiomas. Studies in which there was a visually significant uptake in the brain parenchyma were classified as positive. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were classified as positive, with the results being confirmed by histology (10 cases) or clinical follow-up and imaging, with no false positives or negatives. The mean SUVmax for positive patients was 8.02 and 0.94 for the negative ones, which was significantly different (P=.003) CONCLUSION: PET/CT with FCH shows encouraging results in the evaluation of patients with suspected recurrence of primary brain neoplasms.

Title: Prognostic value of molecular and imaging biomarkers in patients with supratentorial glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We evaluated the relationship between (11)C-methionine PET ((11)C-METH PET) findings and molecular biomarkers in patients with supratentorial glioma who underwent surgery. METHODS: A consecutive series of 109 patients with pathologically proven glioma (64 men, 45 women; median age 43 years) referred to our Institution from March 2012 to January 2015 for tumour resection and who underwent preoperative (11)C-METH PET were analysed. Semiquantitative evaluation of the (11)C-METH PET images included SUVmax, region of interest-to-normal brain SUV ratio (SUVratio) and metabolic tumour volume (MTV). Imaging findings were correlated with disease outcome in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), and compared with other clinical biological data, including IDH1 mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion and MGMT promoter methylation. The patients were monitored for a mean period of 16.7 months (median 13 months). RESULTS: In all patients, the tumour was identified on (11)C-METH PET. Significant differences in SUVmax, SUVratio and MTV were observed in relation to tumour grade (p < 0.001). IDH1 mutation was found in 49 patients, 1p/19q codeletion in 58 patients and MGMT promoter methylation in 74 patients. SUVmax and SUVratio were significantly inversely correlated with the presence of IDH1 mutation (p < 0.001). Using the 2016 WHO classification, SUVmax and SUVratio were significantly higher in patients with primary glioblastoma (IDH1-negative) than in those with other diffuse gliomas (p < 0.001). Relapse or progression was documented in 48 patients (median PFS 8.7 months). Cox regression analysis showed that SUVmax and SUVratio, tumour grade, tumour type on 2016 WHO classification, IDH1 mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion and MGMT promoter methylation were significantly associated with PFS. None of these factors was found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: (11)C-METH PET parameters are significantly correlated with histological grade and IDH1 mutation status in patients with glioma. Grade, pathological classification, molecular biomarkers, SUVmax and SUVratio were prognostic factors for PFS in this cohort of patients. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration: NCT02518061).

Title: (18)F-FET PET prior to recurrent high-grade glioma re-irradiation-additional prognostic value of dynamic time-to-peak analysis and early static summation images?
Abstract: Most high-grade gliomas (HGG) recur after initial multimodal therapy and re-irradiation (Re-RT) has been shown to be a valuable re-treatment option in selected patients. We evaluated the prognostic value of dynamic time-to-peak analysis and early static summation images in O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET for patients treated with Re-RT +/- concomitant bevacizumab. We retrospectively analyzed 72 patients suffering from recurrent HGG with (18)F-FET PET prior to Re-RT. PET analysis revealed the maximal tumor-to-background-ratio (TBR(max)), the biological tumor volume, the number of PET-foci and pattern of time-activity-curves (TACs; increasing vs. decreasing). Furthermore, the novel PET parameters early TBR(max) (at 5-15 min post-injection) and minimal time-to-peak (TTP(min)) were evaluated. Additional analysis was performed for gender, age, KPS, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutational status, WHO grade and concomitant bevacizumab therapy. The influence of PET and clinical parameters on post-recurrence survival (PRS) was investigated. Shorter TTP(min) was related to shorter PRS after Re-RT with 6 months for TTP(min) < 12.5 min, 7 months for TTP(min) 12.5-25 min and 11 months for TTP(min) >25 min (p = 0.027). TTP(min) had a significant impact on PRS both on univariate (p = 0.027; continuous) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.011; continuous). Other factors significantly related to PRS on multivariate analysis were increasing vs. decreasing TACs (p = 0.008) and Karnofsky Performance Score (p = 0.015; <70 vs. >/=70). Early TBR(max) as well as the other conventional PET parameters were not significantly related to PRS on univariate analysis. Dynamic (18)F-FET PET with TTP(min) provides a high prognostic value for recurrent HGG prior to Re-RT, whereas early TBR(max) does not. Dynamic (18)F-FET PET using TTP(min) might help to personalize Re-RT treatment regimens in future through voxelwise TTP(min) analysis for dose painting purposes and PET-guided dose escalation.

Title: Reporter gene imaging of targeted T cell immunotherapy in recurrent glioma.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas are aggressive cancers that often become rapidly fatal. Immunotherapy using CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), engineered to express both herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) zetakine chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), is a treatment strategy with considerable potential. To optimize this and related immunotherapies, it would be helpful to monitor CTL viability and trafficking to glioma cells. We show that noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 9-[4-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine ([(18)F]FHBG) can track HSV1-tk reporter gene expression present in CAR-engineered CTLs. [(18)F]FHBG imaging was safe and enabled the longitudinal imaging of T cells stably transfected with a PET reporter gene in patients. Further optimization of this imaging approach for monitoring in vivo cell trafficking should greatly benefit various cell-based therapies for cancer.

Title: (11)C-Methionine positron emission tomography delineates non-contrast enhancing tumor regions at high risk for recurrence in pediatric high-grade glioma.
Abstract: We assessed the prognostic utility of (11)C-Methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) in pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG). Thirty-one children had 62 MET-PET studies. Segmented tumor volumes from co-registered magnetic resonance studies were assessed for concordance with MET-PET uptake using Boolean operations. The tumor volume at diagnosis and treatment failure was assessed relative to MET-PET avid volume. The prognostic impact of MET-PET-delineated non-contrast enhancing tumor (NCET) was assessed. NCET was defined as the region of tumor defined by defined by FLAIR which did not enhance but showed MET-PET avidity. MET-PET concordance varied according to magnetic resonance sequence. MET-PET rarely added to the tumor volume in most cases. The volume of MET-PET with standardized uptake value >3.0 was differentially distributed at diagnosis, post treatment, and at recurrence. The initial MET-PET region overlapped with recurrent tumor in 90% of the cases. When the proportion of tumor which was NCET was >10%, an earlier time to progression (5.8 months; 95% CI, 1-8.2 vs. 10.5 months; 95% CI, 0.9-NR; p = 0.035) was noted. MET-PET delineates regions at increased risk for recurrence and may improve the definition of failure, prognostic assessment, and target definition for radiotherapy.

Title: The use of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET in the diagnosis of gliomas located in the brainstem and spinal cord.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing number of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET studies in supratentorial gliomas, studies regarding the usefulness of 18F-FET PET in brainstem and spinal cord gliomas to date remain scarce. METHODS: Thirty-six 18F-FET PET scans were performed in 29 patients with brainstem (n = 29 scans) or spinal cord glioma (n = 7 scans). In 32 of 36 PET scans, a dynamic acquisition was performed. Fifteen scans in 15 patients were performed to assess newly diagnosed lesions, and 21 scans were obtained during follow-up: for diagnosing tumor progression (n = 15 scans in 14 patients) as well as for treatment monitoring (n = 6 scans in 3 patients). Four patients underwent additional serial scans (range, 1-2), and 3 of these 4 patients were examined for more than one indication. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios (TBRmax/mean) of 18F-FET uptake (20-40 min post injection) as well as kinetic 18F-FET uptake parameters were determined. Final diagnoses were confirmed histologically (54%) or by clinical follow-up (46%). RESULTS: In all newly diagnosed high-grade (n = 3 patients) and in 5 of 11 patients with low-grade gliomas, 18F-FET uptake was increased (TBRmax >/=2.5 and/or TBRmean >/=1.9). In 2 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas without MR contrast enhancement, 18F-FET PET nevertheless showed increased metabolism. At suspected progression, the combination of TBRs with kinetic 18F-FET parameters correctly identified presence or absence of progressive disease in 9 of 11 patients (82%). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that 18F-FET PET adds valuable diagnostic information in brainstem and spinal cord glioma, particularly when the diagnostic information derived from MRI is equivocal.

Title: Unsupervised consensus cluster analysis of [18F]-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography identified textural features for the diagnosis of pseudoprogression in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: RATIONALE: Timely detection of pseudoprogression (PSP) is crucial for the management of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) but remains difficult. Textural features of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) mirror tumor uptake heterogeneity; some of them may be associated with tumor progression. METHODS: Fourteen patients with HGG and suspected of PSP underwent FET-PET imaging. A set of 19 conventional and textural FET-PET features were evaluated and subjected to unsupervised consensus clustering. The final diagnosis of true progression vs. PSP was based on follow-up MRI using RANO criteria. RESULTS: Three robust clusters have been identified based on 10 predominantly textural FET-PET features. None of the patients with PSP fell into cluster 2, which was associated with high values for textural FET-PET markers of uptake heterogeneity. Three out of 4 patients with PSP were assigned to cluster 3 that was largely associated with low values of textural FET-PET features. By comparison, tumor-to-normal brain ratio (TNRmax) at the optimal cutoff 2.1 was less predictive of PSP (negative predictive value 57% for detecting true progression, p=0.07 vs. 75% with cluster 3, p=0.04). PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Clustering based on textural O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET features may provide valuable information in assessing the elusive phenomenon of pseudoprogression.

Title: Population Pharmacokinetic Approach Applied to Positron Emission Tomography: Computed Tomography for Tumor Tissue Identification in Patients with Glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) is a radiopharmaceutical used in positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography in patients with glioma. We propose an original approach combining a radiotracer-pharmacokinetic exploration performed at the voxel level (three-dimensional pixel) and voxel classification to identify tumor tissue. Our methodology was validated using the standard FET-PET approach and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired according to the current clinical practices. METHODS: FET-PET and MRI data were retrospectively analyzed in ten patients presenting with progressive high-grade glioma. For FET-PET exploration, radioactivity acquisition started 15 min after radiotracer injection, and was measured each 5 min during 40 min. The tissue segmentation relies on population pharmacokinetic modeling with dependent individuals (voxels). This model can be approximated by a linear mixed-effects model. The tumor volumes estimated by our approach were compared with those determined with the current clinical techniques, FET-PET standard approach (i.e., a cumulated value of FET signal is computed during a time interval) and MRI sequences (T1 and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]), used as references. The T1 sequence is useful to identify highly vascular tumor and necrotic tissues, while the T2/FLAIR sequence is useful to isolate infiltration and edema tissue located around the tumor. RESULTS: With our kinetic approach, the volumes of tumor tissue were larger than the tissues identified by the standard FET-PET and MRI T1, while they were smaller than those determined with MRI T2/FLAIR. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the presence of suspected tumor voxels not identified by the standard PET approach.

Title: Change in 18F-Fluoromisonidazole PET Is an Early Predictor of the Prognosis in the Patients with Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Receiving Bevacizumab Treatment.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BEV), a humanized monoclonal antibody, become a currently important chemotherapeutic option for the patients with recurrent glioma. The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate whether 18F-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET have the potential to detect BEV-resistant gliomas in the early-stage. METHODS: We reviewed the FMISO PET and MRI appearances before and 3 to 4 courses after BEV treatment on 18 recurrent glioma patients. FMISO accumulation was assessed by visual inspection and semi-quantitative values which were tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio and hypoxic volume. MRI responses were evaluated based on RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) criteria. The prognostic analysis was performed in relation to the response assessment by FMISO PET and MRI using overall survival (OS) after BEV application. RESULTS: After BEV application, MRI revealed partial response in 14 of 18 patients (78%), of which 9 patients also demonstrated decreased FMISO accumulation. These 9 patients (50%) were classified as "MRI-FMISO double responder". As for the other 5 patients (28%), FMISO accumulation volumes increased or remained stable after BEV treatment although partial responses were achieved on MRI. Therefore, these cases were classified as "MRI-only responder". The remaining 4 patients (22%) did not show treatment response on FMISO PET or MRI ("non-responder"). MRI-FMISO double responders showed significantly longer OS than that in other groups (median 12.4 vs 5.7 months; P < 0.001), whereas there were no overall survival difference between MRI-only responders and non-responders (median OS, 5.7 and 4.8 months; P = 0.58). Among the pre-treatment clinical factors, high FMISO T/N ratio was a significant prognostic factor of overall survival in these patients under the assessment of Cox proportional hazard model. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent gliomas with decreasing FMISO accumulation after short-term BEV application could derive a survival benefit from BEV treatment. Change in FMISO PET appearance can identify BEV-resistant gliomas in early-stage regardless of MRI findings in a comprehensible way.

Title: Intra-lesional spatial correlation of static and dynamic FET-PET parameters with MRI-based cerebral blood volume in patients with untreated glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: (18)F-fluorethyltyrosine-(FET)-PET and MRI-based relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) have both been used to characterize gliomas. Recently, inter-individual correlations between peak static FET-uptake and rCBV have been reported. Herein, we assess the local intra-lesional relation between FET-PET parameters and rCBV. METHODS: Thirty untreated glioma patients (27 high-grade) underwent simultaneous PET/MRI on a 3 T hybrid scanner obtaining structural and dynamic susceptibility contrast sequences. Static FET-uptake and dynamic FET-slope were correlated with rCBV within tumour hotspots across patients and intra-lesionally using a mixed-effects model to account for inter-individual variation. Furthermore, maximal congruency of tumour volumes defined by FET-uptake and rCBV was determined. RESULTS: While the inter-individual relationship between peak static FET-uptake and rCBV could be confirmed, our intra-lesional, voxel-wise analysis revealed significant positive correlations (median r = 0.374, p < 0.0001). Similarly, significant inter- and intra-individual correlations were observed between FET-slope and rCBV. However, rCBV explained only 12% of the static and 5% of the dynamic FET-PET variance and maximal overlap of respective tumour volumes was 37% on average. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the relation between peak values of MR-based rCBV and static FET-uptake can also be observed intra-individually on a voxel basis and also applies to a dynamic FET parameter, possibly determining hotspots of higher biological malignancy. However, just a small part of the FET-PET signal variance is explained by rCBV and tumour volumes determined by the two modalities showed only moderate overlap. These findings indicate that FET-PET and MR-based rCBV provide both congruent and complimentary information on glioma biology.

Title: Simultaneous 11C-Methionine Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Suspected Primary Brain Tumors.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of integrated 11C- methionine PET/MRI for suspected primary brain tumors, in comparison to MRI alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive patients with suspected primary brain tumor were prospectively enrolled for an integrated 11C-methionine PET/MRI. Two neuro-radiologists separately evaluated the MRI alone and the integrated PET/MRI data sets regarding most likely diagnosis and diagnostic confidence on a 5-point scale. Reference standard was histopathology or follow-up imaging. RESULTS: Fifty-one suspicious lesions were detected: 16 high-grade glioma and 25 low-grade glioma. Ten non-malignant cerebral lesions were described by the reference standard. MRI alone and integrated PET/MRI each correctly classified 42 of the 51 lesions (82.4%) as neoplastic lesions (WHO grade II, III and IV) or non-malignant lesions (infectious and neoplastic lesions). Diagnostic confidence for all lesions, low-grade astrocytoma and high-grade astrocytoma (3.7 vs. 4.2, 3,1 vs. 3.8, 4.0 vs. 4,7) were significantly (p < 0.05) better with integrated PET/MRI than in MRI alone. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the high potential of integrated 11C-methionine-PET/MRI for the assessment of suspected primary brain tumors. Although integrated methionine PET/MRI does not lead to an improvement of correct diagnoses, diagnostic confidence is significantly improved.

Title: An MRS- and PET-guided biopsy tool for intraoperative neuronavigational systems.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Glioma heterogeneity and the limitations of conventional structural MRI for identifying aggressive tumor components can limit the reliability of stereotactic biopsy and, hence, tumor characterization, which is a hurdle for developing and selecting effective treatment strategies. In vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) and PET enable noninvasive imaging of cellular metabolism relevant to proliferation and can detect regions of more highly active tumor. Here, the authors integrated presurgical PET and MRS with intraoperative neuronavigation to guide surgical biopsy and tumor sampling of brain gliomas with the aim of improving intraoperative tumor-tissue characterization and imaging biomarker validation. METHODS A novel intraoperative neuronavigation tool was developed as part of a study that aimed to sample high-choline tumor components identified by multivoxel MRS and (18)F-methylcholine PET-CT. Spatially coregistered PET and MRS data were integrated into structural data sets and loaded onto an intraoperative neuronavigation system. High and low choline uptake/metabolite regions were represented as color-coded hollow spheres for targeted stereotactic biopsy and tumor sampling. RESULTS The neurosurgeons found the 3D spherical targets readily identifiable on the interactive neuronavigation system. In one case, areas of high mitotic activity were identified on the basis of high (18)F-methylcholine uptake and elevated choline ratios found with MRS in an otherwise low-grade tumor, which revealed the possible use of this technique for tumor characterization. CONCLUSIONS These PET and MRI data can be combined and represented usefully for the surgeon in neuronavigation systems. This method enables neurosurgeons to sample tumor regions based on physiological and molecular imaging markers. The technique was applied for characterizing choline metabolism using MRS and (18)F PET; however, this approach provides proof of principle for using different radionuclide tracers and other MRI methods, such as MR perfusion and diffusion.

Title: Prognostic value of (18)F-FET PET imaging in re-irradiation of high-grade glioma: Results of a phase I clinical trial.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) provides quantitative metabolic information and potential biomarkers of treatment outcome. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of early (18)F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET scans acquired during re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A phase I clinical trial of re-irradiation of HGG was carried out. MRI and (18)F-FET PET were used for target delineation and follow-up. Images were acquired at baseline, during radiotherapy and 4weeks post-treatment and compared by measuring the metabolically active biological tumor volume (BTV) and maximal activity (T(max)/B). Correlations with outcomes were assessed by multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included and all patients have died. The median overall survival was 7.0 mos. Both baseline BTV and baseline MRI volume (necrotic/cystic cavities subtracted) were prognostic for overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (HR=1.3 p<0.01 and HR=1.3 p<0.01, respectively). Early changes in BTV and T(max)/B were observed but they carried no independent prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline biological tumor volume (BTV) defined by (18)F-FET PET was prognostic for OS in multivariate analysis, as was MRI volume (necrotic/cystic cavities subtracted). Tumor volume may aid in identifying patients whose life expectancy is too short to warrant re-irradiation.

Title: Hypoxia Imaging With PET Correlates With Antitumor Activity of the Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug Evofosfamide (TH-302) in Rodent Glioma Models.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas are often characterized by hypoxia, which is associated with both poor long-term prognosis and therapy resistance. The adverse role hypoxia plays in treatment resistance and disease progression has led to the development of hypoxia imaging methods and hypoxia-targeted treatments. Here, we determined the tumor hypoxia and vascular perfusion characteristics of 2 rat orthotopic glioma models using 18-fluoromisonidozole positron emission tomography. In addition, we determined tumor response to the hypoxia-activated prodrug evofosfamide (TH-302) in these rat glioma models. C6 tumors exhibited more hypoxia and were less perfused than 9L tumors. On the basis of these differences in their tumor hypoxic burden, treatment with evofosfamide resulted in 4- and 2-fold decreases in tumor growth rates of C6 and 9L tumors, respectively. This work shows that imaging methods sensitive to tumor hypoxia and perfusion are able to predict response to hypoxia-targeted agents. This has implications for improved patient selection, particularly in clinical trials, for treatment with hypoxia-activated cytotoxic prodrugs, such as evofosfamide.

Title: Amino-acid PET versus MRI guided re-irradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GLIAA) - protocol of a randomized phase II trial (NOA 10/ARO 2013-1).
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The higher specificity of amino-acid positron emission tomography (AA-PET) in the diagnosis of gliomas, as well as in the differentiation between recurrence and treatment-related alterations, in comparison to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted MRI was demonstrated in many studies and is the rationale for their implementation into radiation oncology treatment planning. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the significant differences between AA-PET and standard MRI concerning the definition of the gross tumor volume (GTV). A small single-center non-randomized prospective study in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas treated with stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) showed a significant improvement in survival when AA-PET was integrated in target volume delineation, in comparison to patients treated based on CT/MRI alone. METHODS: This protocol describes a prospective, open label, randomized, multi-center phase II trial designed to test if radiotherapy target volume delineation based on FET-PET leads to improvement in progression free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) treated with re-irradiation, compared to target volume delineation based on T1Gd-MRI. The target sample size is 200 randomized patients with a 1:1 allocation ratio to both arms. The primary endpoint (PFS) is determined by serial MRI scans, supplemented by AA-PET-scans and/or biopsy/surgery if suspicious of progression. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), locally controlled survival (time to local progression or death), volumetric assessment of GTV delineated by either method, topography of progression in relation to MRI- or PET-derived target volumes, rate of long term survivors (>1 year), localization of necrosis after re-irradiation, quality of life (QoL) assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C15 PAL questionnaire, evaluation of safety of FET-application in AA-PET imaging and toxicity of re-irradiation. DISCUSSION: This is a protocol of a randomized phase II trial designed to test a new strategy of radiotherapy target volume delineation for improving the outcome of patients with recurrent GBM. Moreover, the trial will help to develop a standardized methodology for the integration of AA-PET and other imaging biomarkers in radiation treatment planning. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The GLIAA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01252459 , registration date 02.12.2010), German Clinical Trials Registry ( DRKS00000634 , registration date 10.10.2014), and European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT-No. 2012-001121-27, registration date 27.02.2012).

Title: Repeatability of (18)F-FLT PET in a Multicenter Study of Patients with High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: Quantitative 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET has potential as a noninvasive tumor biomarker for the objective assessment of response to treatment. To guide interpretation of these quantitative data, we evaluated the repeatability of (18)F-FLT PET as part of a multicenter trial involving patients with high-grade glioma. Methods:(18)F-FLT PET was performed on 10 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma at 5 different institutions within the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium trial ABTC1101. Data were acquired according to a double baseline protocol in which PET examinations were repeated within 2 d of each other with no intervening treatment. On each of the 2 imaging days, dedicated brain PET was performed at 2 time points, 1 and 3 h after (18)F-FLT administration. Tumor SUVs and related parameters were measured at a central laboratory using various volumes of interest: isocontour at 30% of the maximum pixel (SUV(mean_30%)), gradient-based segmentation (SUV(mean_gradient)), the maximum pixel (SUV(max)), and a 1-mL sphere at the region of highest uptake (SUV(peak)). Repeatability coefficients (RCs) were calculated from the relative differences between corresponding SUV measurements obtained on the 2 d. Results: RCs for tumor SUVs were 22.5% (SUV(mean_30%)), 23.8% (SUV(mean_gradient)), 23.2% (SUV(max)), and 18.5% (SUV(peak)) at 1 h after injection. Corresponding data at 3 h were 22.4%, 25.0%, 27.3%, and 23.6%. Normalizing the tumor SUV data with reference to a background region improved repeatability, and the most stable parameter was the tumor-to-background ratio derived using SUV(peak) (RC, 16.5%). Conclusion: SUV quantification of (18)F-FLT uptake in glioma had an RC in the range of 18%-24% when imaging began 1 h after (18)F-FLT administration. The volume-of-interest methodology had a small but not negligible influence on repeatability, with the best performance obtained using SUV(peak) Although changes in (18)F-FLT SUV after treatment cannot be directly interpreted as a change in tumor proliferation, we have established ranges beyond which SUV differences are likely due to legitimate biologic effects.

Title: PET and SPECT studies in children with hemispheric low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: Molecular imaging is playing an increasing role in the pretreatment evaluation of low-grade gliomas. While glucose positron emission tomography (PET) can be helpful to differentiate low-grade from high-grade tumors, PET imaging with amino acid radiotracers has several advantages, such as better differentiation between tumors and non-tumorous lesions, optimized biopsy targeting, and improved detection of tumor recurrence. This review provides a brief overview of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies followed by a more detailed review of the clinical applications of glucose and amino acid PET imaging in low-grade hemispheric gliomas. We discuss key differences in the performance of the most commonly utilized PET radiotracers and highlight the advantage of PET/MRI fusion to obtain optimal information about tumor extent, heterogeneity, and metabolism. Recent data also suggest that simultaneous acquisition of PET/MR images and the combination of advanced MRI techniques with quantitative PET can further improve the pretreatment and post-treatment evaluation of pediatric brain tumors.

Title: Comparison of effects of 18F-FDG PET-CT and MRI in identifying and grading gliomas.
Abstract: Glioma is the most common type of brain tumor. Malignant gliomas tend to have an increasingly higher incidence and are difficult to treat. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of the grade of glioma before surgery is very important for planning surgery and determining prognosis. To compare the values of (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography ((18)F-FDG PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for identifying and grading gliomas, we selected 70 patients who were diagnosed as having a primary glioma or suspected glioma at the Peoples Hospital of Liaocheng in Shandong, China, and divided them into an observation group, which was examined by (18)F-FDG PET-CT and a control group, which was examined by MRI. Image analysis, visual semi-quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, follow-up and pathological results of the two groups were compared. Specificity, accuracy and sensitivity of brain MRI and PET-CT in grading the gliomas were calculated, and the results obtained were processed by Chi-squared test. Standard uptake value (SUV), SUV(correct) and L/WM (SUV(max) ratio of a lesion to normal white matters in the opposite side) of FDG in the different grades of glioma were analyzed by single-factor variance analysis. Postoperative pathological detection confirmed 47 cases of glioma; the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET-CT in grading glioma were all higher than those of MRI (P less than 0.05); the correlation between SUV and glioma grade, between SUV(correct) and glioma grade, and between L/WM and glioma had significant difference (P less than 0.05). Thus, it was concluded that (18)F-FDG PET-CT performs better in diagnosing gliomas than MRI and is also more suitable for identifying different grades of glioma.

Title: Utilization of PET imaging in differential diagnostics between a tumefactive multiple sclerosis lesion and low-grade glioma.
Abstract: We present a case where a 30-year-old man with a history of combined MS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT I) disease was additionally diagnosed and treated for grade II glioma (astrocytoma). Tumefactive MS and gliomas are sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another based on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In our case, positron emission tomography (PET) scans with(11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) and (11)C-PK11195 radioligands were performed to aid in differential diagnostics. The diagnosis was confirmed finally by brain biopsy. The usefulness of PET imaging in differential diagnostics between tumefactive MS and glioma is discussed.

Title: Kinetic Modeling and Graphical Analysis of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine (FCho), 18F-Fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET for the Fiscrimination between High-Grade Glioma and Radiation Necrosis in Rats.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Discrimination between glioblastoma (GB) and radiation necrosis (RN) post-irradiation remains challenging but has a large impact on further treatment and prognosis. In this study, the uptake mechanisms of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (18F-FET) and 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCho) positron emission tomography (PET) tracers were investigated in a F98 GB and RN rat model applying kinetic modeling (KM) and graphical analysis (GA) to clarify our previous results. METHODS: Dynamic 18F-FDG (GB n = 6 and RN n = 5), 18F-FET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) and 18F-FCho PET (GB n = 5 and RN n = 5) were acquired with continuous arterial blood sampling. Arterial input function (AIF) corrections, KM and GA were performed. RESULTS: The influx rate (Ki) of 18F-FDG uptake described by a 2-compartmental model (CM) or using Patlak GA, showed more trapping (k3) in GB (0.07 min-1) compared to RN (0.04 min-1) (p = 0.017). K1 of 18F-FET was significantly higher in GB (0.06 ml/ccm/min) compared to RN (0.02 ml/ccm/min), quantified using a 1-CM and Logan GA (p = 0.036). 18F-FCho was rapidly oxidized complicating data interpretation. Using a 1-CM and Logan GA no clear differences were found to discriminate GB from RN. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results we concluded that using KM and GA both 18F-FDG and 18F-FET were able to discriminate GB from RN. Using a 2-CM model more trapping of 18F-FDG was found in GB compared to RN. Secondly, the influx of 18F-FET was higher in GB compared to RN using a 1-CM model. Important correlations were found between SUV and kinetic or graphical measures for 18F-FDG and 18F-FET. 18F-FCho PET did not allow discrimination between GB and RN.

Title: The value of (11)C-methionine PET in the early differentiation between tumour recurrence and radionecrosis in patients treated for a high-grade glioma and indeterminate MRI.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of (11)C-Methionine PET in the early differentiation between tumour recurrence and radionecrosis in patients treated for a high grade glioma. METHOD: The study included 30 patients with glioma (III/IV grade) treated with surgery/radiotherapy/chemotherapy (5-8 months) and with an indeterminate MRI. All patients underwent a (11)C-Methione PET (within 15 days of MRI) and studies were visually analysed (intensity and morphology of uptake), quantified (SUV max/SUV mean background), and coregistered to MRI (3D-Flair). Patient management was decided by the neuro-oncology committee to clinical and imaging follow-up, second-line treatment, or surgery. RESULTS: There were 23 (11)C-Methionine PET studies visually positive. Morphology of uptake was focal in 15, diffuse in 4, and ring-shaped in 4. Three out of the focal uptake cases underwent resection (Histopathology +). Sixteen underwent second-line therapy (11 responded; 5 progressed). The 4 cases with ring-shaped uptake were followed-up, and progression was found in 2 (true-positive), and disease-free in 2 (follow-up of 6 and 7 months, respectively) (false-positive). Seven out of (11)C-Methionine studies PET were visually negative, and all of them were disease-free (follow-up of 3-12 months). SUV lesion/background was 2.79+/-1.35 in tumour recurrence, and 1.53+/-0.39 in radionecrosis (P<.05). Taking into account a SUV lesion/background threshold of 2.35, the sensitivity and specificity values were 90.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Visual analysis, quantitative and PET/MRI coregistration of (11)C-Methionine PET showed their complementary role in patients with indeterminate MRI results, thus allowing early differentiation between tumour recurrence and radionecrosis, and helping in the individual therapy approach.

Title: Epileptic Activity Increases Cerebral Amino Acid Transport Assessed by 18F-Fluoroethyl-l-Tyrosine Amino Acid PET: A Potential Brain Tumor Mimic.
Abstract: O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET is a well-established method increasingly used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring in gliomas. Epileptic activity, frequently occurring in glioma patients, can influence MRI findings. Whether seizures also affect (18)F-FET PET imaging is currently unknown. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the brain amino acid metabolism during epileptic seizures by (18)F-FET PET and to elucidate the pathophysiologic background. METHODS: Ten patients with 11 episodes of serial seizures or status epilepticus, who underwent MRI and (18)F-FET PET, were studied. The main diagnosis was glioma World Health Organization grade II-IV (n = 8); 2 patients suffered from nonneoplastic diseases. Immunohistochemical assessment of LAT1/LAT2/CD98 amino acid transporters was performed in seizure-affected cortex (n = 2) and compared with glioma tissues (n = 3). RESULTS: All patients exhibited increased seizure-associated strict gyral (18)F-FET uptake, which was reversible in follow-up studies or negative shortly before and without any histologic or clinical signs of tumor recurrence. (18)F-FET uptake corresponded to structural MRI changes, compatible with cortical vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, partial contrast enhancement, and hyperperfusion. Patients with prolonged postictal symptoms lasting up to 8 wk displayed intensive and widespread (>/= 1 lobe) cortical (18)F-FET uptake. LAT1/LAT2/CD98 was strongly expressed in neurons and endothelium of seizure-affected brains and less in reactive astrocytosis. CONCLUSION: Seizure activity, in particular status epilepticus, increases cerebral amino acid transport with a strict gyral (18)F-FET uptake pattern. Such periictal pseudoprogression represents a potential pitfall of (18)F-FET PET and may mimic brain tumor. Our data also indicate a seizure-induced upregulation of neuronal, endothelial, and less astroglial LAT1/LAT2/CD98 amino acid transporter expression.

Title: Targeting MT1-MMP as an ImmunoPET-Based Strategy for Imaging Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: A critical challenge in the management of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) tumors is the accurate diagnosis and assessment of tumor progression in a noninvasive manner. We have identified Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as an attractive biomarker for GBM imaging since this protein is actively involved in tumor growth and progression, correlates with tumor grade and is closely associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients. Here, we report the development of an immunoPET tracer for effective detection of MT1-MMP in GBM models. METHODS: An anti-human MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody (mAb), LEM2/15, was conjugated to p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (DFO-NCS) for 89Zr labeling. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies were performed in xenograft mice bearing human GBM cells (U251) expressing MT1-MMP and non-expressing breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) as negative control. Two orthotopic brain GBM models, patient-derived neurospheres (TS543) and U251 cells, with different degrees of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption were also used for PET imaging experiments. RESULTS: 89Zr labeling of DFO-LEM2/15 was achieved with high yield (>90%) and specific activity (78.5 MBq/mg). Biodistribution experiments indicated that 89Zr-DFO-LEM2/15 showed excellent potential as a radiotracer for detection of MT1-MMP positive GBM tumors. PET imaging also indicated a specific and prominent 89Zr-DFO-LEM2/15 uptake in MT1-MMP+ U251 GBM tumors compared to MT1-MMP- MCF-7 breast tumors. Results obtained in orthotopic brain GBM models revealed a high dependence of a disrupted BBB for tracer penetrance into tumors. 89Zr-DFO-LEM2/15 showed much higher accumulation in TS543 tumors with a highly disrupted BBB than in U251 orthotopic model in which the BBB permeability was only partially increased. Histological analysis confirmed the specificity of the immunoconjugate in all GBM models. CONCLUSION: A new anti MT1-MMP-mAb tracer, 89Zr-DFO-LEM2/15, was synthesized efficiently. In vivo validation showed high-specific-contrast imaging of MT1-MMP positive GBM tumors and provided strong evidence for utility of MT1-MMP-targeted immunoPET as an alternate to nonspecific imaging of GBM.

Title: Hyperpolarized (13)C MR imaging detects no lactate production in mutant IDH1 gliomas: Implications for diagnosis and response monitoring.
Abstract: Metabolic imaging of brain tumors using (13)C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate is a promising neuroimaging strategy which, after a decade of preclinical success in glioblastoma (GBM) models, is now entering clinical trials in multiple centers. Typically, the presence of GBM has been associated with elevated hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate produced from [1-(13)C] pyruvate, and response to therapy has been associated with a drop in hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate. However, to date, lower grade gliomas had not been investigated using this approach. The most prevalent mutation in lower grade gliomas is the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, which, in addition to initiating tumor development, also induces metabolic reprogramming. In particular, mutant IDH1 gliomas are associated with low levels of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT1, MCT4), three proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism to lactate. We therefore investigated the potential of (13)C MRS of hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate for detection of mutant IDH1 gliomas and for monitoring of their therapeutic response. We studied patient-derived mutant IDH1 glioma cells that underexpress LDHA, MCT1 and MCT4, and wild-type IDH1 GBM cells that express high levels of these proteins. Mutant IDH1 cells and tumors produced significantly less hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate compared to GBM, consistent with their metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate production was not affected by chemotherapeutic treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) in mutant IDH1 tumors, in contrast to previous reports in GBM. Our results demonstrate the unusual metabolic imaging profile of mutant IDH1 gliomas, which, when combined with other clinically available imaging methods, could be used to detect the presence of the IDH1 mutation in vivo.

Title: Fully parametric imaging with reversible tracer (18)F-FLT within a reasonable time.
Abstract: PET enables quantitative imaging of the rate constants K (1), k (2), k (3), and k (4), with a reversible two tissue compartment model (2TCM). A new method is proposed for computing all of these rates within a reasonable time, less than 1 min. A set of differential equations for the reversible 2TCM was converted into a single formula consisting of differential and convolution terms. The validity was tested on clinical data with (18)F-FLT PET for patients with glioma (n = 39). Parametric images were generated with the formula that was developed. Parametric values were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) for glioma from the images generated, and they were compared with those obtained with the non-linear fitting method. We performed simulation studies for testing accuracy by generating simulated images, assuming clinically expected ranges of the parametric values. The computation time was about 20 s, and the quality of the images generated was acceptable. The values obtained for K (1) for grade IV tumor were 0.24 +/- 0.23 and 0.26 +/- 0.25 ml(-1) min(-1) g(-1) for the image-based and ROI-based methods, respectively. The values were 0.21 +/- 0.12 and 0.21 +/- 0.12 min(-1) for k (2), 0.13 +/- 0.07 and 0.13 +/- 0.07 min(-1) for k (3), and 0.052 +/- 0.020 and 0.054 +/- 0.021 min(-1) for k (4). The differences between the methods were not significant. Regression analysis showed correlations of r = 0.94, 0.86, 0.71, and 0.52 for these parameters. Simulation demonstrated that the accuracy was within acceptable ranges, namely, the correlations were r = 0.99, r = 0.97, r = 0.99, and r = 0.91 for K (1), k (2), k (3), and k (4), respectively, between estimated and assumed values. This results suggest that parametric images can be obtained fully within reasonable time, accuracy, and quality.

Title: Non-routine Tracers for PET Imaging of High-grade Glioma.
Abstract: Thorough imaging is crucial for diagnosis and treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGG), lethal brain tumours with median survival ranging 1-5 years after diagnosis. Positron-emission tomography (PET) is acquiring importance in imaging of HGG since it has the formidable advantage of providing information on tumour metabolism that may be critical for correct diagnosis and treatment planning. Recently employed PET tracers designed for the non-routine investigation of specific aspects of HGG metabolism, including hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, expression of integrins and stem cell markers, are reviewed herein. A thorough choice from among these non-routine tracers may provide important metabolic information complementing those obtained with more common PET analyses, for the sake of diagnostic, prognostic, treatment planning or research purposes.

Title: ImmunoPET Imaging of CD146 Expression in Malignant Brain Tumors.
Abstract: Recently, the overexpression of CD146 and its potential as a therapeutic target in high-grade gliomas, the most lethal type of brain cancer, was uncovered. In this study, we describe the generation of (89)Zr-Df-YY146, a novel (89)Zr-labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the targeting and quantification of CD146 expression in a mouse model of glioblastoma, using noninvasive immunoPET imaging. YY146, a high affinity anti-CD146 mAb, was conjugated to deferoxamine (Df) for labeling with the long-lived positron emitter (89)Zr (t1/2: 78.4 h). In vitro assays, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and Western blot, were performed with two glioblastoma cell lines, U87MG and U251, to determine their CD146 expression levels. Also, YY146 and Df-YY146's CD146-binding affinities were compared using flow cytometry. In vivo CD146-targeting of (89)Zr-Df-YY146 was evaluated by sequential PET imaging, in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneously implanted U87MG or U251 tumors. CD146 blocking, ex vivo biodistribution, and histological studies were carried out to confirm (89)Zr-Df-YY146 specificity, as well as the accuracy of PET data. In vitro studies exposed elevated CD146 expression levels in U87MG cells, but negligible levels in U251 cells. Flow cytometry revealed no differences in affinity between YY146 and Df-YY146. (89)Zr labeling of Df-YY146 proceeded with excellent yield ( approximately 80%), radiochemical purity (>95%), and specific activity ( approximately 44 GBq/mumol). Longitudinal PET revealed prominent and persistent (89)Zr-Df-YY146 uptake in mice bearing U87MG tumors that peaked at 14.00 +/- 3.28%ID/g (n = 4), 48 h post injection of the tracer. Conversely, uptake was significantly lower in CD146-negative U251 tumors (5.15 +/- 0.99%ID/g, at 48 h p.i.; n = 4; P < 0.05). Uptake in U87MG tumors was effectively blocked in a competitive inhibition experiment, corroborating the CD146 specificity of (89)Zr-Df-YY146. Finally, ex vivo biodistribution validated the accuracy of PET data and histological examination successfully correlated tracer uptake with in situ CD146 expression. Prominent, persistent, and specific uptake of (89)Zr-Df-YY146 was observed in brain tumors, demonstrating the potential of this radiotracer for noninvasive PET imaging of CD146 expression. In a future clinical scenario, (89)Zr-Df-YY146 may serve as a tool to guide intervention and assess response to CD146-targeted therapies.

Title: (18)F-FET and (18)F-FCH uptake in human glioblastoma T98G cell lines.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite complex treatment of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, high grade gliomas often recur. Differentiation between post-treatment changes and recurrence is difficult. (18)F-methyl-choline ((18)F-FCH) is frequently used in staging and detection of recurrent prostate cancer disease as well as some brain tumours; however accumulation in inflammatory tissue limits its specificity. The (18)F-ethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) shows a specific uptake in malignant cells, resulting from increased expression of amino acid transporters or diffusing through the disrupted blood-brain barrier. (18)F-FET exhibits lower uptake in machrophages and other inflammatory cells. Aim of this study was to evaluate (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET uptake by human glioblastoma T98G cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human glioblastoma T98G or human dermal fibroblasts cells, seeded at a density to obtain 2 x 10(5) cells per flask when radioactive tracers were administered, grew adherent to the plastic surface at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 in complete medium. Equimolar amounts of radiopharmaceuticals were added to cells for different incubation times (20 to 120 minutes) for (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET respectively. The cellular radiotracer uptake was determined with a gamma counter. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated three times. The uptake measurements are expressed as the percentage of the administered dose of tracer per 2 x 10(5) cells. Data (expressed as mean values of % uptake of radiopharmaceuticals) were compared using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate. Differences were regarded as statistically significant when p<0.05. RESULTS: A significant uptake of (18)F-FCH was seen in T98G cells at 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The percentage uptake of (18)F-FET in comparison to (18)F-FCH was lower by a factor of more than 3, with different kinetic curves.(18)F-FET showed a more rapid initial uptake up to 40 minutes and (18)F-FCH showed a progressive rise reaching a maximum after 90 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FCH and (18)F-FET are candidates for neuro-oncological PET imaging. (18)F-FET could be the most useful oncological PET marker in the presence of reparative changes after therapy, where the higher affinity of (18)F-FCH to inflammatory cells makes it more difficult to discriminate between tumour persistence and non-neoplastic changes. Additional studies on the influence of inflammatory tissue and radionecrotic cellular components on radiopharmaceutical uptake are necessary.

Title: Imaging of Brain Tumors with Copper-64 Chloride: Early Experience and Results.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To conduct the first investigational study that is aimed at evaluating the ability of the simple salt (64)CuCl2 to diagnose cerebral tumors in patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). METHODS: Nineteen patients with a documented history and radiologic evidence of brain tumors were enrolled in the study. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with GBM, and one patient was diagnosed with grade II astrocytoma. After initial cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients were administered with (64)CuCl2 (13 MBq/kg) and brain positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed at 1, 3, and 24 hours after administration. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated and used to figure out the pharmacokinetic profile of the tracer. Absorbed radiation doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM. RESULTS: Copper-64 chloride clearly visualized brain cancerous lesions within 1 hour after injection, with stable retention of radioactivity at 3 and 24 hours. Excellent agreement was found between PET/CT and MRI. No uptake of the tracer was observed in low-grade astrocytoma. The agent cleared rapidly from the blood and was mostly excreted through the liver, without significant kidney washout. Analysis of time variation of SUVmax values showed persistent uptake in malignant tissues with a slight increase of radioactive concentration at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Copper-64 chloride has favorable biological properties for brain imaging and warrants further investigation as a diagnostic tracer for GBM.

Title: A False-Negative Case of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma on 11C-Methionine PET and Intense 18F-FDG Uptake.
Abstract: We report a case of a 44-year-old man with neurological symptoms and MRI findings, which were unable to differentiate between glioma and lymphoma. Metabolic characterization by means of PET imaging with F-FDG and C-methionine is proposed to determine the benign or tumor (high- and low-grade) origin of brain lesions. In this case, the MRI lesion corresponded with an inconclusive metabolic pattern of intense F-FDG uptake and no significant C-methionine uptake. Pathological study revealed a false-negative case of C-methionine due to lymphoma.

Title: Tryptophan PET Imaging of the Kynurenine Pathway in Patient-Derived Xenograft Models of Glioblastoma.
Abstract: Increasing evidence demonstrates the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway's (KP) role in the pathophysiology of human gliomas. To study the KP in vivo, we used the noninvasive molecular imaging tracer alpha-[(11)C]-methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT). The AMT-positron emission tomography (PET) has shown high uptake in high-grade gliomas and predicted survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). We generated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from dissociated cells, or tumor fragments, from 5 patients with GBM. Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were imaged with AMT-PET, and tumors were analyzed to detect the KP enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1, IDO2, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, kynureninase, and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Overall, PET imaging showed robust tumoral AMT uptake in PDX mice with prolonged tracer accumulation over 60 minutes, consistent with AMT trapping seen in humans. Immunostained tumor tissues demonstrated positive detection of multiple KP enzymes. Furthermore, intracranial implantation of GBM cells was performed with imaging at both 9 and 14 days postimplant, with a marked increase in AMT uptake at 14 days and a corresponding high level of tissue immunostaining for KP enzymes. These results indicate that our PDX mouse models recapitulate human GBM, including aberrant tryptophan metabolism, and offer an in vivo system for development of targeted therapeutics for patients with GBM.

Title: A novel, integrated PET-guided MRS technique resulting in more accurate initial diagnosis of high-grade glioma.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignant glioma in adults. Currently, the modality of choice for diagnosing brain tumor is high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which provides anatomic detail and localization. Studies have demonstrated, however, that MRI may have limited utility in delineating the full tumor extent precisely. Studies suggest that MR spectroscopy (MRS) can also be used to distinguish high-grade from low-grade gliomas. However, due to operator dependent variables and the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, the potential for error in diagnostic accuracy with MRS is a concern. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been shown to add additional information with respect to tumor grade, extent, and prognosis based on the premise of biochemical changes preceding anatomic changes. Combined PET/MRS is a technique that integrates information from PET in guiding the location for the most accurate metabolic characterization of a lesion via MRS. We describe a case of glioblastoma multiforme in which MRS was initially non-diagnostic for malignancy, but when MRS was repeated with PET guidance, demonstrated elevated choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) ratio in the right parietal mass consistent with a high-grade malignancy. Stereotactic biopsy, followed by PET image-guided resection, confirmed the diagnosis of grade IV GBM. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an integrated PET/MRS technique for the voxel placement of MRS. Our findings suggest that integrated PET/MRS may potentially improve diagnostic accuracy in high-grade gliomas.

Title: A comparison study of (11)C-methionine and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in evaluation of patients with recurrent brain tumors.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: (11)C-methonine ([(11)C]-MET) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a well-established technique for evaluation of tumor for diagnosis and treatment planning in neurooncology. [(11)C]-MET reflects amino acid transport and has been shown to be more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in stereotactic biopsy planning. This study compared fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and MET PET-CT in the detection of various brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four subjects of brain tumor treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy were subjected to [(18)F]-FDG, [(11)C]-MET, and MRI scan. The lesion was analyzed semiquantitatively using tumor to normal contralateral ratio. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery, stereotactic biopsy, clinical follow-up, MRI, or CT scans. RESULTS: Tumor recurrence was found in 5 out of 22 patients on [F-18] FDG scan while [(11)C]-MET was able to detect recurrence in 18 out of 22 patients in low-grade gliomas. Two of these patients were false positive for the presence of recurrence of tumor and later found to be harboring necrosis. Among oligodendroglioma, medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma out of 42 patients 39 were found to be concordant MET and FDG scans. On semiquantitative analysis, mean T/NT ratio was found to be 2.96 +/- 0.94 for lesions positive for recurrence of tumors and 1.18 +/- 0.74 for lesions negative for recurrence of tumor on [(11)C]-MET scan. While the ratio for FDG scan on semiquantitative analysis was found to be 2.05 +/- 1.04 for lesions positive for recurrence of tumors and 0.52 +/- 0.15 for lesions negative for recurrence of tumors. CONCLUSION: The study highlight that [(11)C]-MET is superior to [(18)F]-FDG PET scans to detect recurrence in low-grade glioma. A cut-off value of target to nontarget value of 1.47 is a useful parameter to distinguish benign from malignant lesion on an [(11)C]-MET Scan. Both [(18)F]-FDG and [(11)C]-MET scans were found to be useful in high-grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and medulloblastoma.

Title: Serial 18F-FET PET Imaging of Primarily 18F-FET-Negative Glioma: Does It Make Sense?
Abstract: PET with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) has gained increasing importance for glioma management. With regard to the occurrence of (18)F-FET-negative glioma, we investigated the value of (18)F-FET PET monitoring of primarily (18)F-FET-negative gliomas concerning the detection of progression and malignant transformation. METHODS: We included 31 patients (26 World Health Organization [WHO] grade II, 5 WHO grade III) with primarily (18)F-FET-negative glioma and available (18)F-FET PET follow-up. (18)F-FET PET analysis comprised maximal tumor-to-background ratio (TBRmax) and dynamic analysis of tumoral (18)F-FET uptake over time (increasing vs. decreasing) including minimal time to peak (TTPmin). PET findings were correlated with MRI and clinical findings of progression as well as histology of recurrent tumors. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 31 patients experienced tumor progression (median progression-free survival, 41.7 mo). Fourteen of 23 patients showed tumoral (18)F-FET uptake concurrent to and 4 of 23 before MRI-derived or clinical signs of tumor progression; 2 of 23 patients presented signs of progression in MRI when no concomitant (18)F-FET PET was available, but subsequent follow-up PET was positive. In 3 of 23 patients, no (18)F-FET uptake was detected at tumor progression. Overall, 20 of 31 primarily (18)F-FET-negative glioma turned (18)F-FET-positive during the follow-up. At first occurrence of tumoral (18)F-FET uptake, TBRmax was significantly higher in patients with malignant transformation (11/20) than in those without malignant progression (3.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.5; P = 0.001), resulting in a high detection rate for malignant transformation (for TBRmax > 2.46: sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 89%; negative predictive value, 80%; positive predictive value, 90%; and accuracy, 85%). Although static evaluation was superior to dynamic analysis for the detection of malignant transformation (for TTPmin </= 17.5 min: sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 67%; negative predictive value, 67%; positive predictive value, 73%; and accuracy, 70%), short TTPmin was associated with an early malignant transformation in the further disease course. Overall, 18 of 31 patients experienced malignant transformation; of these, 16 of 17 (94%) evaluable patients showed (18)F-FET uptake at the time of malignant transformation. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET PET monitoring with static and dynamic evaluation is useful even in primarily (18)F-FET-negative glioma, providing a high detection rate of both tumor progression and malignant transformation, partly before further signs of progression in MRI. Hence, (18)F-FET uptake indicating malignant transformation might influence the patient management.

Title: Effect of alpha-Methyl versus alpha-Hydrogen Substitution on Brain Availability and Tumor Imaging Properties of Heptanoic [F-18]Fluoroalkyl Amino Acids for Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
Abstract: Two [(18)F]fluoroalkyl substituted amino acids differing only by the presence or absence of a methyl group on the alpha-carbon, (S)-2-amino-7-[(18)F]fluoro-2-methylheptanoic acid ((S)-[(18)F]FAMHep, (S)-[(18)F]14) and (S)-2-amino-7-[(18)F]fluoroheptanoic acid ((S)-[(18)F]FAHep, (S)-[(18)F]15), were developed for brain tumor imaging and compared to the well-established system L amino acid tracer, O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ([(18)F]FET), in the delayed brain tumor (DBT) mouse model of high-grade glioma. Cell uptake, biodistribution, and PET/CT imaging studies showed differences in amino acid transport of these tracer by DBT cells. Recognition of (S)-[(18)F]15 but not (S)-[(18)F]14 by system L amino acid transporters led to approximately 8-10-fold higher uptake of the alpha-hydrogen substituted analogue (S)-[(18)F]15 in normal brain. (S)-[(18)F]15 had imaging properties similar to those of (S)-[(18)F]FET in the DBT tumor model while (S)-[(18)F]14 afforded higher tumor to brain ratios due to much lower uptake by normal brain. These results have important implications for the future development of alpha-alkyl and alpha,alpha-dialkyl substituted amino acids for brain tumor imaging.

Title: Neuroimaging.
Abstract: Imaging is integral to the management of patients with brain tumors. Conventional structural imaging provides exquisite anatomic detail but remains limited in the evaluation of molecular characteristics of intracranial neoplasms. Quantitative and physiologic biomarkers derived from advanced imaging techniques have been increasingly utilized as problem-solving tools to identify glioma grade and assess response to therapy. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the imaging strategies used in the clinical assessment of patients with gliomas and describes how novel imaging biomarkers have the potential to improve patient management.

Title: Randomized phase II study of axitinib versus physicians best alternative choice of therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Abstract: We conducted a randomized, non-comparative, multi center, phase II clinical trial in order to investigate the efficacy of axitinib, an oral small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high affinity and specificity for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma following prior treatment with radiation and temozolomide. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with axitinib (5 mg BID starting dose; N = 22) or "physicians best alternative choice of therapy" that consisted of bevacizumab (N = 20) or lomustine (N = 2). Six-month progression-free survival served as the primary endpoint. The estimated 6-month progression-free survival rate was 34 % (95 % CI 14-54) for patients treated with axitinib and 28 % (95 % CI 8-48) with best alternative treatment; median overall survival was 29 and 17 weeks, respectively. Objective responses according to RANO criteria were documented in 28 % of patients treated with axitinib and 23 % of patients treated with best alternative therapy. A decrease in maximal uptake of 18F-fluoro-ethyL-tyrosine (18F-FET) by the glioblastoma on PET imaging was documented in 85 % of patients at the time of response on axitinib. Corticosteroid treatment could be stopped in four and tapered in seven out of the 15 patients who were treated with steroids at baseline in the axitinib cohort. Most frequent axitinib related grade >/=3 adverse events consisted of fatigue (9 %), diarrhea (9 %), and oral hyperesthesia (4.5 %). We conclude that axitinib has single-agent clinical activity and a manageable toxicity profile in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

Title: Ability of (18)F-DOPA PET/CT and fused (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI to assess striatal involvement in paediatric glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic performance of (18)F-DOPA PET/CT and fused (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI in detecting striatal involvement in children with gliomas. METHODS: This retrospective study included 28 paediatric patients referred to our institution for the presence of primary, residual or recurrent glioma (12 boys, 16 girls; mean age 10.7 years) and investigated with (18)F-DOPA PET/CT and brain MRI. Fused (18)F-DOPA PET/MR images were obtained and compared with PET/CT and MRI images. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) for striatal involvement were calculated for each diagnostic tool. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were applied to evaluate the associations between (18)F-DOPA PET/CT and fused (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI diagnostic results and tumour uptake outside the striatum, grade, dimension and site of striatal involvement (ventral and/or dorsal). RESULTS: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 100 % for MRI, 93 %, 89 %, 100 %, 100 % and 82 % for (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI, and 75 %, 74 %, 78 %, 88 % and 58 % for (18)F-DOPA PET/CT, respectively. (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI showed a trend towards higher accuracy compared with (18)F-DOPA PET/CT (p = 0.06). MRI showed significantly higher accuracy compared with (18)F-DOPA PET/CT (p = 0.01), but there was no significant difference between MRI and (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI. Both univariate and multivariate logistic analyses showed a significant association (OR 8.0 and 7.7, respectively) between the tumour-to-normal striatal uptake (T/S) ratio and the diagnostic ability of (18)F-DOPA PET/CT (p = 0.03). A strong significant association was also found between involvement of the dorsal striatum and the (18)F-DOPA PET/CT results (p = 0.001), with a perfect prediction of involvement of the dorsal striatum by (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI. CONCLUSION: Physiological striatal (18)F-DOPA uptake does not appear to be a main limitation in the evaluation of basal ganglia involvement.(18)F-DOPA PET/CT correctly detected involvement of the dorsal striatum in lesions with a T/S ratio >1, but appeared to be less suitable for evaluation of the ventral striatum. The use of fused (18)F-DOPA PET/MRI further improves the accuracy and is essential for evaluation of the ventral striatum.

Title: Radiotherapy to volumes defined by metabolic imaging in gliomas: time to abandon monstrous margins?
Abstract: The survival in patients with high grade gliomas (HGG) remains poor even after the adoption post-operative radiotherapy (RT) to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based volumes. Despite delivery of 'standardized' doses of radiation, recurrence is the norm, rather than the exception. Recurrences occur both within, and outside of the volume of irradiation, leading us to two questions-firstly concerning the adequacy of the dose of radiation used, and secondly about the current methods of treatment volume delineation. The emergence of newer radiopharmaceuticals for use in positron emission tomography (PET) have kindled the hope of more precise volume localizations for post-operative RT, and it is likely that these new radiopharmaceuticals can help us define accurate areas at highest risk of recurrence and thus allow us to use increased doses of radiation with confidence.

Title: Positron emission tomography of high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas [HGG (WHO grades III-IV)] are almost invariably fatal. Imaging of HGG is important for orientating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning and is crucial for development of novel, more effective therapies. Given the potentially unlimited number of usable tracing molecules and the elevated number of available radionuclides, PET allows gathering multiple informations on HGG including data on tissue metabolism and drug pharmacokinetics. PET studies on the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of HGG carried out by most frequently used tracers and radionuclides ((11)C and (18)F) and published in 2014 have been reviewed. These studies demonstrate that a thorough choice of tracers may confer elevated diagnostic and prognostic power to PET imaging of HGG. They also suggest that a combination of PET and MRI may give the most complete and reliable imaging information on HGG and that research on hybrid PET/MRI may be paying back in terms of improved diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning of these deadly tumours.

Title: Pilot Preclinical and Clinical Evaluation of (4S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-Glutamate (18F-FSPG) for PET/CT Imaging of Intracranial Malignancies.
Abstract: PURPOSE: (S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) is a novel radiopharmaceutical for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. It is a glutamate analogue that can be used to measure xC- transporter activity. This study was performed to assess the feasibility of 18F-FSPG for imaging orthotopic brain tumors in small animals and the translation of this approach in human subjects with intracranial malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: For the small animal study, GS9L glioblastoma cells were implanted into brains of Fischer rats and studied with 18F-FSPG, the 18F-labeled glucose derivative 18F-FDG and with the 18F-labeled amino acid derivative 18F-FET. For the human study, five subjects with either primary or metastatic brain cancer were recruited (mean age 50.4 years). After injection of 300 MBq of 18F-FSPG, 3 whole-body PET/Computed Tomography (CT) scans were obtained and safety parameters were measured. The three subjects with brain metastases also had an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Quantitative and qualitative comparison of the scans was performed to assess kinetics, biodistribution, and relative efficacy of the tracers. RESULTS: In the small animals, the orthotopic brain tumors were visualized well with 18F-FSPG. The high tumor uptake of 18F-FSPG in the GS9L model and the absence of background signal led to good tumor visualization with high contrast (tumor/brain ratio: 32.7). 18F-FDG and 18F-FET showed T/B ratios of 1.7 and 2.8, respectively. In the human pilot study, 18F-FSPG was well tolerated and there was similar distribution in all patients. All malignant lesions were positive with 18F-FSPG except for one low-grade primary brain tumor. In the 18F-FSPG-PET-positive tumors a similar T/B ratio was observed as in the animal model. CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FSPG is a novel PET radiopharmaceutical that demonstrates good uptake in both small animal and human studies of intracranial malignancies. Future studies on larger numbers of subjects and a wider array of brain tumors are planned. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01186601.

Title: Prognostic Value of O-(2-[18F]-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine-Positron Emission Tomography Imaging for Histopathologic Characteristics and Progression-Free Survival in Patients with Low-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography ((18)F-FET-PET) imaging is applied for tumor grading, prognostic stratification, and diagnosis of tumor recurrence, especially in high-grade gliomas. Experience with (18)F-FET-PET imaging in low-grade gliomas is limited. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess (18)F-FET-PET tracer uptake in low-grade gliomas and to investigate possible correlations with contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology. METHODS: A total of 65 patients (29 female, 36 male, median age 38 years) with newly diagnosed or recurrent low-grade gliomas for whom preoperative MRI and (18)F-FET-PET imaging were available were included. Tumor entity, tumor location, as well as histopathology (isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH] 1/2 mutation, Ki67, p53, oligodendroglial differentiation, 1p19q codeletion), and progression-free survival were assessed. (18)F-FET-PET images were acquired and fused to MRI (T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) and tumor volume was measured in areas with a tumor-to-background ratio >1.3, >1.6, and >2.0 and in MRI. RESULTS: PET tracer uptake was observed in 78.5% of all World Health Organization Grade I and II tumors. (18)F-FET uptake showed a high negative predictive value for oligodendroglial components and for 1p19q codeletion. No further significant correlation between histologic features, progression-free survival, or IDH1/2 mutation status and tracer uptake was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 78.5% of low-grade gliomas do show elevated tracer uptake in (18)F-FET-PET imaging. Low-grade glioma without tracer uptake exclude oligodendroglial differentiation and 1p19q codeletion. Further differentiation between molecular subtypes is not possible with static (18)F-FET-PET. No correlation of progression-free survival to tracer uptake and IDH1/2-mutation status was observed.

Title: Expression of 58-kD Microspherule Protein (MSP58) is Highly Correlated with PET Imaging of Tumor Malignancy and Cell Proliferation in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: The nucleolar 58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) has important transcriptional regulation functions and plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) has emerged as a promising positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for evaluating tumor malignancy and cell proliferation. METHODS: In the present study, the expression of MSP58 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and the corresponding PET image was examined using FLT-PET in 55 patients with various grades of gliomas. RESULTS: The immunoreactivity score (IRS) of MSP58 increased with tumor grade with grade IV gliomas exhibiting the highest expression and showed a highly significant positive correlation with the Ki-67 index (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The IRS of MSP58 in the tumor showed a highly significant positive correlation with corresponding FLT uptake value (r = 0.61, P < 0.001). The correlation between MSP58 expression and glioma malignancy was also confirmed by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blot analysis. FLT uptake value also exhibited a highly significant positive correlation with the Ki-67 index (r = 0.59, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that MSP58 expression has a significant prognostic ability for the overall survival time similar to that found in the uptake value of FLT-PET. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MSP58 plays an important role in cell proliferation and will be one of the potential candidates of molecular therapy targeting proliferation. FLT-PET might be used as an early measure of treatment response in the proliferation-targeted therapy.

Title: A Dual Tracer 18F-FCH/18F-FDG PET Imaging of an Orthotopic Brain Tumor Xenograft Model.
Abstract: Early diagnosis of low grade glioma has been a challenge to clinicians. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-FDG as a radio-tracer has limited utility in this area because of the high background in normal brain tissue. Other radiotracers such as 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) could provide better contrast between tumor and normal brain tissue but with high incidence of false positives. In this study, the potential application of a dual tracer 18F-FCH/18F-FDG-PET is investigated in order to improve the sensitivity of PET imaging for low grade glioma diagnosis based on a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. BALB/c nude mice with and without orthotopic glioma xenografts from U87 MG-luc2 glioma cell line are used for the study. The animals are subjected to 18F-FCH and 18F-FDG PET imaging, and images acquired from two separate scans are superimposed for analysis. The 18F-FCH counts are subtracted from the merged images to identify the tumor. Micro-CT, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), histology and measurement of the tumor diameter are also conducted for comparison. Results show that there is a significant contrast in 18F-FCH uptake between tumor and normal brain tissue (2.65 +/- 0.98), but with a high false positive rate of 28.6%. The difficulty of identifying the tumor by 18F-FDG only is also proved in this study. All the tumors can be detected based on the dual tracer technique of 18F-FCH/18F-FDG-PET imaging in this study, while the false-positive caused by 18F-FCH can be eliminated. Dual tracer 18F-FCH/18F-FDG PET imaging has the potential to improve the visualization of low grade glioma. 18F-FCH delineates tumor areas and the tumor can be identified by subtracting the 18F-FCH counts. The sensitivity was over 95%. Further studies are required to evaluate the possibility of applying this technique in clinical trials.

Title: Concurrent functional and metabolic assessment of brain tumors using hybrid PET/MR imaging.
Abstract: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using an integrated PET/MR system in tumor grading as well as in differentiating recurrent tumor from treatment-induced effects (TIE) in brain tumor patients. Twenty patients (Group A: treatment naive, 9 patients with 16 lesions; Group B: post-therapy, 11 patients with 18 lesions) underwent fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET/MR with PWI. Two blinded readers predicted low versus high-grade tumor (for Group A) and tumor recurrence versus TIE (for Group B) based solely on tumor rCBV (regional cerebral blood volume) and SUV (standardized uptake values). Tumor histopathology at resection was the reference standard. Using rCBV(mean) </= 1.74 as a cut-off, 100% sensitivity and 74% specificity were observed, whereas 75% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity were observed with SUV(mean) </= 4.0 as a cut-off to classify patients as test positive for low-grade tumors (Group A) and TIE (Group B). Diagnostic accuracy for detection of low-grade tumors was 90% using PWI and 40% using PET in Group A (p = 0.056); for detection of TIE in Group B, diagnostic accuracy was 94.1% using PWI and 55.6% using PET (p = 0.033). No significant correlation was demonstrated between rCBV parameters and SUV in Group A (mean values: p > 0.403), Group B (p > 0.06) and in the entire population (p > 0.07). Best overall sensitivity and specificity were obtained using rCBV(mean) </= 1.74 and SUV(mean) </= 4.0 cut-off values. PWI demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy in both groups. Poor correlation was observed between FDG and rCBV parameters.

Title: Correlation of (18)F-fluoroethyl tyrosine positron-emission tomography uptake values and histomorphological findings by stereotactic serial biopsy in newly diagnosed brain tumors using a refined software tool.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard neuroimaging method to diagnose neoplastic brain lesions, as well as to perform stereotactic biopsy surgical planning. MRI has the advantage of providing structural anatomical details with high sensitivity, though histological specificity is limited. Although combining MRI with other imaging modalities, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), has proven to increment specificity, exact correlation between PET threshold uptake ratios (URs) and histological diagnosis and grading has not yet been described. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to correlate exactly the histopathological criteria of the biopsy site to its PET uptake value with high spatial resolution (mm(3)), and to analyze the diagnostic value of PET using the amino acid O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in patients with newly diagnosed brain lesions in comparison to histological findings obtained from stereotactic serial biopsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 23 adult patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors on MRI were enrolled in this study. Subsequently to diagnoses, all patients underwent a (18)F-FET PET-guided stereotactic biopsy, using an original newly developed software module, which is presented here. Conventional MRI, stereotactic computed tomography series, and (18)F-FET PET images were semiautomatically fused, and hot-spot detection was performed for target planning. UR was determined using the uptake value from the biopsy sites in relation to the contralateral frontal white matter. UR values >/=1.6 were considered positive for glioma. High-grade glioma (HGG) was suspected with URs >/=3.0, while low-grade glioma (LGG) was suspected with URs between 1.6 and 3.0. Stereotactic serial biopsies along the trajectory at multiple sites were performed in millimeter steps, and the FET URs for each site were correlated exactly with a panel of 27 different histopathological markers. Comparisons between FET URs along the biopsy trajectories and the histological diagnoses were made with Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Analysis of variance was performed to test for significant differences in maximum UR between different tumor grades. RESULTS: A total of 363 biopsy specimens were taken from 23 patients by stereotactic serial biopsies. Histological examination revealed eight patients (35%) with an LGG: one with a World Health Organization (WHO)-I lesion and seven with a WHO-II lesion. Thirteen (57%) patients revealed an HGG (two with a WHO-III and three with a WHO-IV tumor), and two patients (9%) showed a process that was neither HGG nor LGG (group X or no-grade group). The correlation matrix between histological findings and the UR revealed five strong correlations. Low cell density in tissue samples was found to have a significant negative correlation with the measured cortical uptake rate (r=-0.43, P=0.02), as well as moderate cell density (r=-0.48, P=0.02). Pathological patterns of proliferation (r=0.37, P=0.04), GFAP (r=0.37, P=0.04), and Olig2 (r=0.36, P=0.05) showed a significant positive correlation with cortical URs. Analysis of variance tests showed a significant difference between the LGG and the HGG groups (F=8.27, P<0.002), but no significant differences when differentiating between the X group and the HGG (P=0.2)/LGG (P=0.8) groups, nor between the no-grade group and the WHO-I group. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET PET is a valuable tool, as it allows the differentiation of HGGs from LGGs. Its use is not limited to preoperative evaluation; it may also refine biopsy targeting and improve tumor delimitation for radiotherapy. Histology is still necessary, and remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of brain lesions.

Title: Early static (18)F-FET-PET scans have a higher accuracy for glioma grading than the standard 20-40 min scans.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Current guidelines for glioma imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) using the amino acid analogue O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) recommend image acquisition from 20-40 min post injection (p.i.). The maximal tumour-to-background evaluation (TBRmax) obtained in these summation images does not enable reliable differentiation between low and high grade glioma (LGG and HGG), which, however, can be achieved by dynamic (18)F-FET-PET. We investigated the accuracy of tumour grading using TBRmax values at different earlier time points after tracer injection. METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen patients with histologically proven primary diagnosis of glioma (131 LGG, 183 HGG) who had undergone 40-min dynamic (18)F-FET-PET scans were retrospectively evaluated. TBRmax was assessed in the standard 20-40 min summation images, as well as in summation images from 0-10 min, 5-15 min, 5-20 min, and 15-30 min p.i., and kinetic analysis was performed. TBRmax values and kinetic analysis were correlated with histological classification. ROC analyses were performed for each time frame and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were assessed. RESULTS: TBRmax values in the earlier summation images were significantly better for tumour grading (P < 0.001) when compared to standard 20-40 min scans, with best results for the early 5-15 min scan. This was due to higher TBRmax in the HGG (3.9 vs. 3.3; p < 0.001), while TBRmax remained nearly stable in the LGG (2.2 vs. 2.1). Overall, accuracy increased from 70 % in the 20-40 min analysis to 77 % in the 5-15 min images, but did not reach the accuracy of dynamic analysis (80 %). CONCLUSIONS: Early TBRmax assessment (5-15 min p.i.) is more accurate for the differentiation between LGG and HGG than the standard static scan (20-40 min p.i.) mainly caused by the characteristic high (18)F-FET uptake of HGG in the initial phase. Therefore, when dynamic (18)F-FET-PET cannot be performed, early TBRmax assessment can be considered as an alternative for tumour grading.

Title: Amino acid positron emission tomography to monitor chemotherapy response and predict seizure control and progression-free survival in WHO grade II gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with WHO grade II glioma may respond to chemotherapy that is currently not standardized regarding timing and treatment duration. Metabolic changes during chemotherapy may precede structural tumor volume reductions. We therefore compared time courses of amino acid PET and MRI responses to temozolomide (TMZ) and assessed whether responses correlated with seizure control and progression-free survival (PFS). METHODS: PET and MRI were performed before and during TMZ chemotherapy. Tumor volumes were calculated using regions-of-interest analysis. Amino acid uptake was also quantified as metabolically active tumor volume and tumor-to-cerebellum uptake ratio. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five PET and 125 MRI scans from 33 patients were analyzed. Twenty-five patients showed metabolic responses that exhibited an exponential time course with a 25% reduction of the active volume on average after 2.3 months. MRI responses followed a linear course with a 25% reduction after 16.8 months. Reduction of metabolically active tumor volumes, but not reduction of PET uptake ratios or MRI tumor volumes, correlated with improved seizure control following chemotherapy (P = .012). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis showed that a decrease of the active tumor volume of >/=80.5% predicts a PFS of >/=60 months (P = .018) and a decrease of >/=64.5% a PFS of >/=48 months (P = .037). CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid PET is superior to MRI for evaluating TMZ responses in WHO grade II glioma patients. The response delay between both imaging modalities favors amino acid PET for individually tailoring the duration of chemotherapy. Additional studies should investigate whether this personalized approach is appropriate with regard to outcome.

Title: Targeting CD146 with a 64Cu-labeled antibody enables in vivo immunoPET imaging of high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: Given the highly heterogeneous character of brain malignancies and the associated implication for its proper diagnosis and treatment, finding biomarkers that better characterize this disease from a molecular standpoint is imperative. In this study, we evaluated CD146 as a potential molecular target for diagnosis and targeted therapy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal brain malignancy. YY146, an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was generated and radiolabeled for noninvasive positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of orthotopic GBM models. (64)Cu-labeled YY146 preferentially accumulated in the tumors of mice bearing U87MG xenografts, which allowed the acquisition of high-contrast PET images of small tumor nodules ( approximately  2 mm). Additionally, we found that tumor uptake correlated with the levels of CD146 expression in a highly specific manner. We also explored the potential therapeutic effects of YY146 on the cancer stem cell (CSC) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) properties of U87MG cells, demonstrating that YY146 can mitigate those aggressive phenotypes. Using YY146 as the primary antibody, we performed histological studies of World Health Organization (WHO) grades I through IV primary gliomas. The positive correlation found between CD146-positive staining and high tumor grade (chi(2) = 9.028; P = 0.029) concurred with the GBM data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and validated the clinical value of YY146. In addition, we demonstrate that YY146 can be used to detect CD146 in various cancer cell lines and human resected tumor tissues of multiple other tumor types (gastric, ovarian, liver, and lung), indicating a broad applicability of YY146 in solid tumors.

Title: Prognostic Value of Metabolic Tumor Volume on (11)C-Methionine PET in Predicting Progression-Free Survival in High-Grade Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: C-11 methionine (MET) PET is commonly used for diagnosing high-grade glioma (HGG). Recently, volumetric analysis has been widely applied to oncologic PET imaging. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on MET PET in HGG. METHODS: A total of 30 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 12) and glioblastoma multiforme (n = 18) who underwent MET PET before treatment (surgery followed by chemo-radiotherapy) were retrospectively enrolled. Maximal tumor-to-normal brain ratio (TNRmax, maximum tumor activity divided by mean of normal tissue) and MTV (volume of tumor tissue that shows uptake >1.3-fold of mean uptake in normal tissue) were measured on MET PET. Adult patients were classified into two subgroups according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG RPA) classification. Prognostic values of TNRmax, MTV and clinicopathologic factors were evaluated with regard to progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Median PFS of all patients was 7.9 months (range 1.0-53.8 months). In univariate analysis, MTV (cutoff 35 cm(3)) was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.01), whereas TNRmax (cutoff 3.3) and RTOG RPA class were not (P = 0.80 and 0.61, respectively). Treatment of surgical resection exhibited a borderline significance (P = 0.06). In multivariate analysis, MTV was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: MTV on MET PET is a significant and independent prognostic factor for PFS in HGG patients, whereas TNRmax is not. Thus, performing volumetric analysis of MET PET is recommended in HGG for better prognostication.

Title: Preclinical TSPO Ligand PET to Visualize Human Glioma Xenotransplants: A Preliminary Study.
Abstract: Current positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarkers for detection of infiltrating gliomas are limited. Translocator protein (TSPO) is a novel and promising biomarker for glioma PET imaging. To validate TSPO as a potential target for molecular imaging of glioma, TSPO expression was assayed in a tumor microarray containing 37 high-grade (III, IV) gliomas. TSPO staining was detected in all tumor specimens. Subsequently, PET imaging was performed with an aryloxyanilide-based TSPO ligand, [18F]PBR06, in primary orthotopic xenograft models of WHO grade III and IV gliomas. Selective uptake of [18F]PBR06 in engrafted tumor was measured. Furthermore, PET imaging with [18F]PBR06 demonstrated infiltrative glioma growth that was undetectable by traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Preliminary PET with [18F]PBR06 demonstrated a preferential tumor-to-normal background ratio in comparison to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG). These results suggest that TSPO PET imaging with such high-affinity radiotracers may represent a novel strategy to characterize distinct molecular features of glioma growth, as well as better define the extent of glioma infiltration for therapeutic purposes.

Title: Correlation of 4'-[methyl-(11)C]-thiothymidine uptake with Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and tumor grade in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas in comparison with (11)C-methionine uptake.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A novel radiopharmaceutical, 4'-[methyl-(11)C]thiothymidine ((11)C-4DST), has been developed as an in vivo cell proliferation marker based on the DNA incorporation method. The purpose of this study was to evaluate (11)C-4DST uptake in patients with newly diagnosed glioma and to correlate the results with proliferative activity and tumor grade, in comparison with L-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine ((11)C-MET). METHODS: Investigations of (11)C-4DST and (11)C-MET PET/CT were performed retrospectively in 23 patients with newly diagnosed glioma. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for tumor (T) and the mean SUV for normal contralateral hemisphere (N) were calculated, and the tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio was determined. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was defined as the volume with a threshold of 40% of the SUVmax. Proliferative activity as indicated by the Ki-67 index was estimated in tissue specimens. RESULTS: Of 23 gliomas examined, (11)C-4DST PET/CT and (11)C-MET PET/CT detected 20 and 22, respectively. Linear regression analysis between (11)C-4DST and (11)C-MET indicated a weak correlation for SUVmax (r = 0.54, P < 0.008), for T/N ratio (r = 0.56, P < 0.006), and for MTV (r = 0.60, P < 0.003). Linear regression analysis indicated a weak correlation between (11)C-4DST and Ki-67 index for SUVmax (r = 0.46, P < 0.03), for T/N ratio (r = 0.43, P < 0.05), and for MTV (r = 0.68, P < 0.001) and between (11)C-MET MTV and Ki-67 index (r = 0.43, P < 0.04). Using (11)C-4DST, there was a significant difference in SUVmax between grades II and IV (P < 0.03) and in MTV between grades II and IV (P < 0.009) and grades III and IV (P < 0.02). Using (11)C-MET, there was a significant difference in SUVmax (P < 0.009) and T/N ratio (P < 0.02) between grades II and IV and in MTV between grades II and IV (P < 0.03) and grades III and IV (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: (11)C-4DST PET/CT is feasible for imaging of brain gliomas, as well as (11)C-MET PET/CT. Especially, it showed the highest correlation coefficient between (11)C-4DST MTV and Ki-67 index in newly diagnosed gliomas.

Title: The Sum of Tumour-to-Brain Ratios Improves the Accuracy of Diagnosing Gliomas Using 18F-FET PET.
Abstract: Gliomas are common brain tumours, but obtaining tissue for definitive diagnosis can be difficult. There is, therefore, interest in the use of non-invasive methods to diagnose and grade the disease. Although positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorethyltyrosine (18F-FET) can be used to differentiate between low-grade (LGG) and high-grade (HGG) gliomas, the optimal parameters to measure and their cut-points have yet to be established. We therefore assessed the value of single and dual time-point acquisition of 18F-FET PET parameters to differentiate between primary LGGs (n = 22) and HGGs (n = 24). PET examination was considered positive for glioma if the metabolic activity was 1.6-times higher than that of background (contralateral) brain, and maximum tissue-brain ratios (TBRmax) were calculated 10 and 60 min after isotope administration with their sums and differences calculated from individual time-point values. Using a threshold-based method, the overall sensitivity of PET was 97%. Several analysed parameters were significantly different between LGGs and HGGs. However, in a receiver operating characteristics analysis, TBR sum had the best diagnostic accuracy of 87% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, 72.7%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. 18F-FET PET is valuable for the non-invasive determination of glioma grade, especially when dual time-point metrics are used. TBR sum shows the greatest accuracy, sensitivity, and negative predictive value for tumour grade differentiation and is a simple method to implement. However, the cut-off may differ between institutions and calibration strategies would be useful.

Title: The use of (18)F-FDG PET to differentiate progressive disease from treatment induced necrosis in high grade glioma.
Abstract: In the follow-up of patients treated for high grade glioma, differentiation between progressive disease (PD) and treatment-induced necrosis (TIN) is challenging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET for the differentiation between TIN and PD after high grade glioma treatment. We retrospectively identified patients between January 2011 and July 2013 that met the following criteria: age >18; glioma grade 3 or 4; treatment with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy; new or progressive enhancement on post treatment MRI; FDG PET within 4 weeks of MRI. Absolute and relative (to contralateral white matter) values of SUVmax and SUVpeak were determined in new enhancing lesions on MRI. The outcome of PD or TIN was determined by neurosurgical biopsy/resection, follow-up MRI, or clinical deterioration. The association between FDG PET and outcome was analyzed with univariate logistic regression and ROC analysis for: all lesions, lesions >10, >15, and >20 mm. We included 30 patients (5 grade 3 and 25 grade 4), with 39 enhancing lesions on MRI. Twenty-nine lesions represented PD and 10 TIN. Absolute and relative values of SUVmax and SUVpeak showed no significant differences between PD and TIN. ROC analysis showed highest AUCs for relative SUVpeak in all lesion sizes. Relative SUVpeak for lesions >20 mm showed reasonable discriminative properties [AUC 0.69 (0.41-0.96)]. FDG PET has reasonable discriminative properties for differentiation of PD from TIN in high grade gliomas larger than 20 mm. Overall diagnostic performance is insufficient to guide clinical decision-making.

Title: Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of 11C-Methionine PET for Nonenhancing Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive radiologic evaluation of glioma can facilitate correct diagnosis and detection of malignant transformation. Although positron-emission tomography is considered valuable in the care of patients with gliomas, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine have reportedly shown ambiguous results in terms of grading and prognostication. The present study compared the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of diffusion tensor imaging, FDG, and (11)C-methionine PET in nonenhancing gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed nonenhancing gliomas that underwent both FDG and (11)C-methionine PET were retrospectively investigated (23 grade II and 12 grade III gliomas). Apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of both FDG and (11)C-methionine PET were compared between grade II and III gliomas. Prognostic values of these parameters were also tested by using progression-free survival. RESULTS: Grade III gliomas showed significantly higher average tumor-to-normal tissue and maximum tumor2-to-normal tissue than grade II gliomas in (11)C-methionine (P = .013, P = .0017, respectively), but not in FDG-PET imaging. There was no significant difference in average ADC, minimum ADC, average fractional anisotropy, and maximum fractional anisotropy. (11)C-methionine PET maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 2.0 was most suitable for detecting grade III gliomas among nonenhancing gliomas (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 73.9%). Among patients not receiving any adjuvant therapy, median progression-free survival was 64.2 +/- 7.2 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of <2.0 for (11)C-methionine PET and 18.6 +/- 6.9 months in patients with maximum tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of >2.0 (P = .0044). CONCLUSIONS: (11)C-methionine PET holds promise for World Health Organization grading and could offer a prognostic imaging biomarker for nonenhancing gliomas.

Title: The Value of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid in Low-grade Gliomas and High-grade Gliomas Lacking Glioblastoma Imaging Features: An Analysis Based on Fluorescence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 18F-Fluoroethyl Tyrosine Positron Emission Tomography, and Tumor Molecular Factors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of grade II and most grade III gliomas fluoresce after 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) application. Conversely, approximately 30% of nonenhancing gliomas are actually high grade. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify preoperative factors (ie, age, enhancement, 18F-fluoroethyl tyrosine positron emission tomography [F-FET PET] uptake ratios) for predicting fluorescence in gliomas without typical glioblastomas imaging features and to determine whether fluorescence will allow prediction of tumor grade or molecular characteristics. METHODS: Patients harboring gliomas without typical glioblastoma imaging features were given 5-ALA. Fluorescence was recorded intraoperatively, and biopsy specimens collected from fluorescing tissue. World Health Organization (WHO) grade, Ki-67/MIB-1 index, IDH1 (R132H) mutation status, O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, and 1p/19q co-deletion status were assessed. Predictive factors for fluorescence were derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and F-FET PET. Classification and regression tree analysis and receiver-operating-characteristic curves were generated for defining predictors. RESULTS: Of 166 tumors, 82 were diagnosed as WHO grade II, 76 as grade III, and 8 as glioblastomas grade IV. Contrast enhancement, tumor volume, and F-FET PET uptake ratio >1.85 predicted fluorescence. Fluorescence correlated with WHO grade (P < .001) and Ki-67/MIB-1 index (P < .001), but not with MGMT promoter methylation status, IDH1 mutation status, or 1p19q co-deletion status. The Ki-67/MIB-1 index in fluorescing grade III gliomas was higher than in nonfluorescing tumors, whereas in fluorescing and nonfluorescing grade II tumors, no differences were noted. CONCLUSION: Age, tumor volume, and F-FET PET uptake are factors predicting 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in gliomas without typical glioblastoma imaging features. Fluorescence was associated with an increased Ki-67/MIB-1 index and high-grade pathology. Whether fluorescence in grade II gliomas identifies a subtype with worse prognosis remains to be determined.

Title: The Role of PET [18F]FDOPA in Evaluating Low-grade Glioma.
Abstract: AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine ([(18)F]-FDOPA) positron-emission tomography (PET) in predicting the risk of radiological progression of disease in patients affected by low-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients affected by grade II glioma were consecutively enrolled in a prospective observational study at the Department of Neurology of Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome, Italy. At enrolment, all patients underwent PET [(18)F]-FDOPA and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and clinical and radiological assessments with MRI every six months to evaluate the progression of disease. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients affected by grade II glioma (30 males and 20 females) were included in the study. The multivariate analysis showed that standardized uptake value greater than 1.75 and disease duration were independent predictors of disease progression. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the PET [(18)F]-FDOPA may play an important prognostic role in evaluation of low-grade glioma.

Title: Multi-modal imaging of tumor cellularity and Tryptophan metabolism in human Gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess gliomas using image-based estimation of cellularity, we utilized isotropic diffusion spectrum imaging (IDSI) on clinically feasible diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and compared it with amino acid uptake measured by alpha[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan positron emission tomography (AMT-PET). METHODS: In 10 patients with a newly-diagnosed glioma, metabolically active tumor regions were defined in both FLAIR hyperintense areas and based on increased uptake on AMT-PET. A recently developed independent component analysis with a ball and stick model was extended to perform IDSI in clinical DTI data. In tumor regions, IDSI was used to define tumor cellularity which was compared between low and high grade glioma and correlated with the glioma proliferative index. RESULTS: The IDSI-derived cellularity values were elevated in both FLAIR and AMT-PET-derived regions of high-grade gliomas. ROC curve analysis found that the IDSI-derived cellularity can provide good differentiation of low-grade from high-grade gliomas (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of 0.80/0.80/0.80). . Both apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IDSI-derived cellularity showed a significant correlation with the glioma proliferative index (based on Ki-67 labeling; R = 0.95, p < 0.001), which was particularly strong when the tumor regions were confined to areas with high tryptophan uptake excluding areas with peritumoral edema. CONCLUSION: IDSI-MRI combined with AMT-PET may provide a multi-modal imaging tool to enhance pretreatment assessment of human gliomas by evaluating tumor cellularity and differentiate low-grade form high-grade gliomas.

Title: Performance of 18F-FET versus 18F-FDG-PET for the diagnosis and grading of brain tumors: systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: For the past decade (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) and (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) have been used for the assessment of patients with brain tumor. However, direct comparison studies reported only limited numbers of patients. Our purpose was to compare the diagnostic performance of FET and FDG-PET. METHODS: We examined studies published between January 1995 and January 2015 in the PubMed database. To be included the study should: (i) use FET and FDG-PET for the assessment of patients with isolated brain lesion and (ii) use histology as the gold standard. Analysis was performed on a per patient basis. Study quality was assessed with STARD and QUADAS criteria. RESULTS: Five studies (119 patients) were included. For the diagnosis of brain tumor, FET-PET demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.79-0.98) and pooled specificity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.37-0.99), with an area under the curve of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97), a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 8.1 (95% CI: 0.8-80.6), and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02-0.30), while FDG-PET demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.27-0.50) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.31-0.99), with an area under the curve of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.36-0.44), an LR+ of 2.7 (95% CI: 0.3-27.8), and an LR- of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.47-1.11). Target-to-background ratios of either FDG or FET, however, allow distinction between low- and high-grade gliomas (P > .11). CONCLUSIONS: For brain tumor diagnosis, FET-PET performed much better than FDG and should be preferred when assessing a new isolated brain tumor. For glioma grading, however, both tracers showed similar performances.

Title: Qualitative analysis of spinal intramedullary lesions using PET/CT.
Abstract: OBJECT Although the usefulness of PET for brain lesions has been established, few reports have examined the use of PET for spinal intramedullary lesions. This study investigated the diagnostic utility of PET/CT for spinal intramedullary lesions. METHODS l-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine (MET)- or [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT was performed in 26 patients with spinal intramedullary lesions. The region of interest (ROI) within the spinal cord parenchyma was placed manually in the axial plane. Maximum pixel counts in the ROIs were normalized to the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) using subject body weight. For FDG-PET the SUV(max) was corrected for lean body mass (SUL(max)) to exclude any influence of the patient's body shape. Each SUV was analyzed based on histopathological results after surgery. The diagnostic validity of the SUV was further compared with the tumor proliferation index using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 index). RESULTS A total of 16 patients underwent both FDG-PET and MET-PET, and the remaining 10 patients underwent either FDG-PET or MET-PET. Pathological diagnoses included high-grade malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or anaplastic ependymoma in 5 patients; low-grade malignancy such as hemangioblastoma, diffuse astrocytoma, or ependymoma in 12 patients; and nonneoplastic lesion including cavernous malformation in 9 patients. Both FDG and MET accumulated significantly in high-grade malignancy, and the SUL(max) and SUV(max) correlated with the tumor proliferation index. Therapeutic response after chemotherapy or radiation in high-grade malignancy was well monitored. However, a significant difference in SUL(max) and SUV(max) for FDG-PET and MET-PET was not evident between low-grade malignancy and nonneoplastic lesions. CONCLUSIONS Spinal PET/CT using FDG or MET for spinal intramedullary lesions appears useful and practical, particularly for tumors with high-grade malignancy. Differentiation of tumors with low-grade malignancy from nonneoplastic lesions may still prove difficult. Further technological refinement, including the selection of radiotracer or analysis evaluation methods, is needed.

Title: Textural analysis of pre-therapeutic [18F]-FET-PET and its correlation with tumor grade and patient survival in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) is well established in the diagnostic work-up of malignant brain tumors. Analysis of FET-PET data using tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) has been shown to be highly valuable for the detection of viable hypermetabolic brain tumor tissue; however, it has not proven equally useful for tumor grading. Recently, textural features in 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET have been proposed as a method to quantify the heterogeneity of glucose metabolism in a variety of tumor entities. Herein we evaluate whether textural FET-PET features are of utility for grading and prognostication in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS: One hundred thirteen patients (70 men, 43 women) with histologically proven high-grade gliomas were included in this retrospective study. All patients received static FET-PET scans prior to first-line therapy. TBR (max and mean), volumetric parameters and textural parameters based on gray-level neighborhood difference matrices were derived from static FET-PET images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and discriminant function analyses were used to assess the value for tumor grading. Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were employed for analysis of progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: All FET-PET textural parameters showed the ability to differentiate between World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV tumors (p < 0.001; AUC 0.775). Further improvement in discriminatory power was possible through a combination of texture and metabolic tumor volume, classifying 85 % of tumors correctly (AUC 0.830). TBR and volumetric parameters alone were correlated with tumor grade, but showed lower AUC values (0.644 and 0.710, respectively). Furthermore, a correlation of FET-PET texture but not TBR was shown with patient PFS and OS, proving significant in multivariate analysis as well. Volumetric parameters were predictive for OS, but this correlation did not hold in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of uptake heterogeneity in pre-therapeutic FET-PET using textural features proved valuable for the (sub-)grading of high-grade glioma as well as prediction of tumor progression and patient survival, and showed improved performance compared to standard parameters such as TBR and tumor volume. Our results underscore the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity in the biology of high-grade glial cell tumors and may contribute to individual therapy planning in the future, although they must be confirmed in prospective studies before incorporation into clinical routine.

Title: Correlation of SUV-Derived Indices With Tumoral Aggressiveness of Gliomas in Static 18F-FDOPA PET: Use in Clinical Practice.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Glioma grading is necessary for prognostic evaluation and optimal treatment decisions. The aims of this study were to establish whether a correlation between F-FDOPA uptake with tumor grade was observed and to determine which of the SUV-derived indices was the best correlated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients were retrospectively included (mean [SD] age, 36.8 [12.1] years) including 21 proven low-grade tumors due to histology, imaging, and clinical follow-up and 10 histologically proven high-grade tumors. Static PET acquisitions were postreconstructed between the 10th and 30th minute after injection of F-FDOPA. Regions of interest of 20 mm were applied to tumors, and isocontoured volumes were defined at levels of 50% and 80% of the peak intensity voxel. Background was quantified with 30-mm-diameter regions of interest on contralateral striatum and centrum semioval. Tumoral uptake was evaluated with the following SUV-derived indices: SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVmax, and SUVmean of isocontoured volume, tumor/striatum ratio (T/S), and tumor/normal brain ratio (T/N). RESULTS: All the SUV-derived indices tested were significantly correlated with tumor grade, considering low-grade and high-grade groups (P < 0.05), except for the SUVmean 50%. The 2 best-correlated indices were SUVmean T/N and SUVmean T/S, with correlation coefficients of 0.561 and 0.522, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis defined optimal thresholds of 1.33 and 1 for sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 100% and 67% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: F-FDOPA PET SUV-derived indices are routinely available information that enables accurate discrimination of low-grade and high-grade gliomas. The best-correlated indices were SUVmean T/N and SUVmean T/S with thresholds of 1.33 and 1.

Title: Malignant melanoma mimicking giant cell variant of glioblastoma multiforme: a case report and review of literature.
Abstract: We present a case of metastatic malignant melanoma in a patient initially diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, giant cell variant. A forty year old female presented to our institution for a re-resection of a recurrent right parietal lobe mass, presumed to be recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. PET scan during preoperative evaluation revealed a 3 cm left lower lobe lung mass. Metastatic glioblastoma to lung was considered in the differential diagnosis. Resection of the brain mass revealed a highly pleomorphic giant and spindle cell lesion with an immunophenotype strongly supportive of melanoma. Immunostains for melanocytic markers were subsequently performed on the lung biopsy specimen, and demonstrated diffuse staining of the atypical cells, supporting the diagnosis of malignant melanoma in the lung. This case demonstrates the importance of considering melanoma in the differential in any tumor with high grade features.

Abstract: Here we compare translocator protein (TSPO) imaging using 6-chloro-2-(4'-(123)I-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-diethyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide SPECT ((123)I-CLINDE) and amino acid transport imaging using O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine PET ((18)F-FET) and investigate whether (123)I-CLINDE is superior to (18)F-FET in predicting progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at follow-up. METHODS: Three patients with World Health Organization grade IV GBM were scanned with (123)I-CLINDE SPECT, (18)F-FET PET, and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging. Molecular imaging data were compared with follow-up gadolinium-enhanced MR images or contrast-enhanced CT scans. RESULTS: The percentage overlap between volumes of interest (VOIs) of increased (18)F-FET uptake and (123)I-CLINDE binding was variable (12%-42%). The percentage overlap of MR imaging baseline VOIs was greater for (18)F-FET (79%-93%) than (123)I-CLINDE (15%-30%). In contrast, VOIs of increased contrast enhancement at follow-up compared with baseline overlapped to a greater extent with baseline (123)I-CLINDE VOIs than (18)F-FET VOIs (21% vs. 8% and 72% vs. 55%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that TSPO brain imaging in GBM may be a useful tool for predicting tumor progression at follow-up and may be less susceptible to changes in blood-brain barrier permeability than (18)F-FET. Larger studies are warranted to test the clinical potential of TSPO imaging in GBM, including presurgical planning and radiotherapy.

Title: Increasing feasibility and utility of (18)F-FDOPA PET for the management of glioma.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite radical treatment therapies, glioma continues to carry with it a uniformly poor prognosis. Patients diagnosed with WHO Grade IV glioma (glioblastomas; GBM) generally succumb within two years, even those with WHO Grade III anaplastic gliomas and WHO Grade II gliomas carry prognoses of 2-5 and 2 years, respectively. PET imaging with (18)F-FDOPA allows in vivo assessment of the metabolism of glioma relative to surrounding tissues. The high sensitivity of (18)F-DOPA imaging grants utility for a number of clinical applications. METHODS: A collection of published work about (18)F-FDOPA PET was made and a critical review was discussed and written. RESULTS: A number of research papers have been published demonstrating that in conjunction with MRI, (18)F-FDOPA PET provides greater sensitivity and specificity than these modalities in detection, grading, prognosis and validation of treatment success in both primary and recurrent gliomas. In further comparisons with (11)C-MET, (18)F-FLT, (18)F-FET and MRI, (18)F-FDOPA has shown similar or better efficacy. Recently synthesis cassettes have become available, making (18)F-FDOPA more accessible. CONCLUSIONS: According to the available data, (18)F-FDOPA PET is a viable radiotracer for imaging and treatment planning of gliomas. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATION FOR PATIENT CARE: (18)F-FDOPA PET appears to be a viable radiopharmaceutical for the diagnosis and treatment planning of gliomas cases, improving on that of MRI and (18)F-FDG PET.

Title: TGF-beta Antibody Uptake in Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Imaged with 89Zr-Fresolimumab PET.
Abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is involved in glioma development. The monoclonal antibody fresolimumab (GC1008) can neutralize all mammalian isoforms of TGF-beta, and tumor uptake can be visualized and quantified with (89)Zr-fresolimumab PET in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the fresolimumab uptake in recurrent high-grade gliomas using (89)Zr-fresolimumab PET and to assess treatment outcome in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with fresolimumab. METHODS: Patients with recurrent glioma were eligible. After intravenous administration of 37 MBq (5 mg) of (89)Zr-fresolimumab, PET scans were acquired on day 2 or day 4 after tracer injection. Thereafter, patients were treated with 5 mg of fresolimumab per kilogram intravenously every 3 wk. (89)Zr-fresolimumab tumor uptake was quantified as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). MR imaging for response evaluation was performed after 3 infusions or as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Twelve patients with recurrent high-grade glioma were included: 10 glioblastomas, 1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma. All patients underwent (89)Zr-fresolimumab PET 4 d after injection. In 4 patients, an additional PET scan was obtained on day 2 after injection. SUVmax on day 4 in tumor lesions was 4.6 (range, 1.5-13.9) versus a median SUVmean of 0.3 (range, 0.2-0.5) in normal brain tissue. All patients showed clinical or radiologic progression after 1-3 infusions of fresolimumab. Median progression-free survival was 61 d (range, 25-80 d), and median overall survival was 106 d (range, 37-417 d). CONCLUSION: (89)Zr-fresolimumab penetrated recurrent high-grade gliomas very well but did not result in clinical benefit.

Title: [(18)F]-fluoro-L-thymidine PET and advanced MRI for preoperative grading of gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Conventional MRI based on contrast enhancement is often not sufficient in differentiating grade II from grade III and grade III from grade IV diffuse gliomas. We assessed advanced MRI, MR spectroscopy and [(18)F]-fluoro-l-thymidine ([(18)F]-FLT) PET as tools to overcome these limitations. METHODS: In this prospective study, thirty-nine patients with diffuse gliomas of grades II, III or IV underwent conventional MRI, perfusion, diffusion, proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and [(18)F]-FLT-PET imaging before surgery. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Cho/Cr, NAA/Cr, Cho/NAA and FLT-SUV were compared between grades. RESULTS: Cho/Cr showed significant differences between grade II and grade III gliomas (p = 0.03). To discriminate grade II from grade IV and grade III from grade IV gliomas, the most relevant parameter was the maximum value of [(18)F]-FLT uptake FLTmax (respectively, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001). The parameter showing the best correlation with the grade was the mean value of [(18)F]-FLT uptake FLTmean (R(2) = 0.36, p < 0.0001) and FLTmax (R(2) = 0.5, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Whereas advanced MRI parameters give indications for the grading of gliomas, the addition of [(18)F]-FLT-PET could be of interest for the accurate preoperative classification of diffuse gliomas, particularly for identification of doubtful grade III and IV gliomas.

Title: Molecular imaging correlates of tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway in human meningiomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increased tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway (KP) is a key mechanism of tumoral immune suppression in gliomas. However, details of tryptophan metabolism in meningiomas have not been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated in vivo tryptophan metabolism in meningiomas and compared it with gliomas using alpha-[(11)C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-PET. We also explored expression patterns of KP enzymes in resected meningiomas. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with MRI-detected meningioma (n = 16) and glioma (n = 31) underwent presurgical AMT-PET scanning. Tumoral AMT uptake and tracer kinetic parameters (including K and k3' evaluating unidirectional uptake and trapping, respectively) were measured, correlated with meningioma grade, and compared between meningiomas and gliomas. Patterns of KP enzyme expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in all meningiomas. RESULTS: Meningioma grade showed a positive correlation with AMT k3' tumor/cortex ratio (r = 0.75, P = .003), and this PET parameter distinguished grade I from grade II/III meningiomas with 92% accuracy. Kinetic AMT parameters could differentiate meningiomas from both low-grade gliomas (97% accuracy by k3' ratios) and high-grade gliomas (83% accuracy by K ratios). Among 3 initial KP enzymes (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1/2, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 [TDO2]), TDO2 showed the strongest immunostaining, particularly in grade I meningiomas. TDO2 also showed a strong negative correlation with AMT k3' ratios (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: PET imaging of tryptophan metabolism can provide quantitative imaging markers for differentiating grade I from grade II/III meningiomas. TDO2 may be an important driver of in vivo tryptophan metabolism in these tumors. These results can have implications for pharmacological targeting of the KP in meningiomas.

Title: Evaluation of trans-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid accumulation in low-grade glioma in chemically induced rat models: PET and autoradiography compared with morphological images and histopathological findings.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can have a problem to delineate diffuse gliomas with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) especially when a marked peritumoral edema is present. We evaluated the potential of trans-1-amino-3-(18)F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-(18)F-FACBC) positron emission tomography (PET) to delineate the extent of diffuse gliomas by comparing PET findings with autoradiography, in vivo and ex vivo MRI, and histopathology findings. METHODS: Dynamic PET was performed in rats with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced glioma for 60 min after anti-(18)F-FACBC injection. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed before or after PET. The PET images were fused with in vivo and ex vivo MR images, and histopathological images for direct comparisons. Autoradiograms were compared with the results of Evans Blue (EB) extravasation (to assess BBB integrity) and hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: Histopathological examination, including EB extravasation assessment, and enhanced T1-weighted MRI identified several diffuse gliomas with slight BBB disruption, similar to low-grade human gliomas. Anti-(18)F-FACBC uptake was specific and high in the gliomas, irrespective of BBB integrity. Higher anti-(18)F-FACBC uptake corresponded to areas of T2 hyperintensity, independent of gadolinium enhancement. Ex vivo autoradiography also showed high anti-(18)F-FACBC accumulation in tumors lacking EB extravasation and a correlation between anti-(18)F-FACBC accumulation and tumor cell density, but not EB extravasation. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-(18)F-FACBC-PET allowed visualization of gliomas irrespective of BBB integrity. The tumor-to-normal uptake ratio of anti-(18)F-FACBC generally correlated with the relative cell density. Anti-(18)F-FACBC PET combined with MRI shows promise for preoperative glioma delineation. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Radiopharmaceuticals that cross the BBB, such as anti-(18)F-FACBC, are taken up by low-grade gliomas with equivocal MRI findings due to an intact BBB. IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: Surgery is the first-line therapy for low-grade gliomas; therefore, delineation of their extent in the presence of an intact BBB is essential to planning surgery that removes the entire neoplasm, which will positively affect long-term survival.

Title: The use of dynamic O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine PET in the diagnosis of patients with progressive and recurrent glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We evaluated the diagnostic value of static and dynamic O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET parameters in patients with progressive or recurrent glioma. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 132 dynamic (18)F-FET PET and conventional MRI scans of 124 glioma patients (primary World Health Organization grade II, n = 55; grade III, n = 19; grade IV, n = 50; mean age, 52 +/- 14 y). Patients had been referred for PET assessment with clinical signs and/or MRI findings suggestive of tumor progression or recurrence based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios of (18)F-FET uptake were determined (20-40 min post-injection) as well as tracer uptake kinetics (ie, time to peak and patterns of the time-activity curves). Diagnoses were confirmed histologically (95%) or by clinical follow-up (5%). Diagnostic accuracies of PET and MR parameters for the detection of tumor progression or recurrence were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses/chi-square test. RESULTS: Tumor progression or recurrence could be diagnosed in 121 of 132 cases (92%). MRI and (18)F-FET PET findings were concordant in 84% and discordant in 16%. Compared with the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI to diagnose tumor progression or recurrence (85%), a higher accuracy (93%) was achieved by (18)F-FET PET when a mean tumor/brain ratio >/=2.0 or time to peak <45 min was present (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 93%; positive predictive value, 100%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Static and dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters differentiate progressive or recurrent glioma from treatment-related nonneoplastic changes with higher accuracy than conventional MRI.

Title: Upfront chemotherapy and subsequent resection for molecularly defined gliomas.
Abstract: Functional preservation is critical in glioma surgery, and the extent of resection influences survival outcome. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising option because of its potential to facilitate tumor shrinkage and maximum tumor resection. The object of this study was to assess the utility of the neoadjuvant strategy in a prospective series of gliomas with favorable molecular status. Twenty-six consecutive cases of diffuse gliomas of WHO grade II or III with either 1p19q codeletion or MGMT methylation were treated with upfront chemotherapy following maximal safe removal. In cases of incomplete initial surgery, second-look resection was intended after tumor volume decrease by chemotherapy. Among 22 evaluable cases, chemotherapy led to a median change in the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters of -35 %, and 14 out of the 22 cases (64 %) showed objective response. Second-look resection after tumor volume decrease was performed in 12 out of 19 cases of incomplete initial surgery (GTR/STR 9, removal of residual methionine PET uptake 3). The median progression-free survival among the 22 patients with grade II tumors was 57 months, with some cases showing durable progression-free survival after second-look resection. MIB-1 indices of the second-look resected tumors were lower than those of the initial tumors, and the methylation status of the MGMT gene was unchanged. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on molecular guidance often produces significant volume decrease of incompletely resected gliomas. Radical second-look resection is an optional advantage of upfront chemotherapy for chemosensitive gliomas compared with initial radiotherapy.

Title: Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 in high-grade gliomas: PET/CT with (68)Ga-DOTA-peptides, correlation to prognostic markers, and implications for targeted radiotherapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) express somatostatin receptors (SSTR), rendering them candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Our purpose was to evaluate the potential of (68)Ga-DOTA-1-Nal(3)-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTANOC) or (68)Ga-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTATOC) to target SSTR subtype 2 (SSTR2) in HGGs, and to study the association between SSTR2 expression and established biomarkers. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (mean age 52 years) with primary or recurrent HGG prospectively underwent (68)Ga-DOTA-peptide positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before resection. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and receptor binding potential (BP) were calculated on PET/CT and disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-T1-Gad). Tumor volume concordance between PET and MRI-T1-Gad was assessed by Dice similarity coefficient (DC) and correlation by Spearman's rank. Immunohistochemically determined SSTR2 status was compared to receptor imaging findings, prognostic biomarkers, and survival with Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson chi-square, and multivariate Cox regression, respectively. RESULTS: All 19 HGGs with disrupted BBB demonstrated tracer uptake. Tumor SUVmax (2.25 +/- 1.33) correlated with MRI-T1-Gad (r = 0.713, P = 0.001) although DC 0.41 +/- 0.19 suggested limited concordance. SSTR2 immunohistochemistry was regarded as positive in nine HGGs (32%) but no correlation with SUVmax or BP was found. By contrast, SSTR2 expression was associated with IDH1 mutation (P = 0.007), oligodendroglioma component (P = 0.010), lower grade (P = 0.005), absence of EGFR amplification (P = 0.021), and longer progression-free survival (HR 0.161, CI 0.037 to 0.704, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: In HGGs, uptake of (68)Ga-DOTA-peptides is associated with disrupted BBB and cannot be predicted by SSTR2 immunohistochemistry. Thus, PET/CT shows limited value to detect HGGs suitable for PRRT. However, high SSTR2 expression portends favorable outcome along with established biomarkers such as IDH1 mutation.

Title: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy plus bevacizumab after response to bevacizumab plus irinotecan as a rescue treatment for high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the possibility of implementing a new scheme of rescue treatment after relapse or progression of high-grade glioma (HGG) treated at the first-line with bevacizumab and irinotecan (BVZ+CPT11), evaluating the response and toxicity of associating BVZ and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (BVZ+FSRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 59 patients with relapse of HGG. Nine patients with HGG relapse after treatment using the Stupp protocol that were treated with BVZ+CPT11 for progression between July 2007 and August 2012, after which the response was assessed according to the Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. BVZ was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg and FSRT up to a prescribed dose of 30 Gy, 500 cGy per fraction, three days a week. The median follow-up was 38 months. RESULTS: The treatment was well-tolerated by all patients. The response after nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3-6 months was progression in two patients, stable disease in four, and three patients had a partial response. The median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis until death or the last control was 36.8 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.8 months. The results from tumour sub-group analysis indicated that the PFS was not statistically significant although it seemed that it was higher in grade-III. The OS was higher in grade-III gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BVZ+FSRT as a second-line HGG relapse rescue treatment is well-tolerated and seems to offer promising results. We believe that multi-centre prospective studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy and toxicity of this therapeutic approach.

Title: Late Persistent Increased Putaminal 18F-DOPA Uptake Following Ipsilateral Frontal Resection: Evidence for Corticostriatal Synaptic Plasticity?
Abstract: We report the finding of late persistent increased putaminal F-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) uptake following resection of a high-grade glioma involving the lateral portion of the ipsilateral precentral gyrus. Brain MRI findings were consistent with secondary putaminal degeneration. This F-DOPA PET phenomenon possibly represents elevated presynaptic dopamine function secondary to upregulation of the amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) activity, as a compensatory mechanism in response to cortical injury. In the setting of brain tumor surveillance, focal increased striatal F-DOPA uptake should be carefully interpreted in light of MRI findings and pathological changes related to corticostriatal connections.

Title: Prognostic value of volume-based measurements on (11)C-methionine PET in glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: (11)C-methionine (MET) PET is an established diagnostic tool for glioma. Studies have suggested that MET uptake intensity in the tumor is a useful index for predicting patient outcome. Because MET uptake is known to reflect tumor expansion more accurately than MRI, we aimed to elucidate the association between volume-based tumor measurements and patient prognosis. METHODS: The study population comprised 52 patients with newly diagnosed glioma who underwent PET scanning 20 min after injection of 370 MBq MET. The tumor was contoured using a threshold of 1.3 times the activity of the contralateral normal cortex. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was defined as the total volume within the boundary. Total lesion methionine uptake (TLMU) was defined as MTV times the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) within the boundary. The tumor-to-normal ratio (TNR), calculated as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) divided by the contralateral reference value, was also recorded. All patients underwent surgery (biopsy or tumor resection) targeting the tissue with high MET uptake. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the predictive value of each measurement. RESULTS: Grade II tumor was diagnosed in 12 patients (3 diffuse astrocytoma, 2 oligodendroglioma, and 7 oligoastrocytoma), grade III in 18 patients (8 anaplastic astrocytoma, 6 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and 4 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma), and grade IV in 22 patients (all glioblastoma). TNR, MTV and TLMU were 3.1 +/- 1.2, 51.6 +/- 49.9 ml and 147.7 +/- 153.3 ml, respectively. None of the three measurements was able to categorize the glioma patients in terms of survival when all patients were analyzed. However, when only patients with astrocytic tumor (N = 33) were analyzed (i.e., when those with oligodendroglial components were excluded), MTV and TLMU successfully predicted patient outcome with higher values associated with a poorer prognosis (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while the predictive ability of TNR did not reach statistical significance (P = NS). CONCLUSION: MTV and TLMU may be useful for predicting outcome in patients with astrocytic tumor.

Title: Assessing Biological Response to Bevacizumab Using 18F-Fluoromisonidazole PET/MR Imaging in a Patient with Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma.
Abstract: We present our initial experience in using single modality fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET/MR imaging to noninvasively evaluate the biological effects induced by bevacizumab therapy in a patient treated for recurrent high grade glioma. In this index patient, bevacizumab therapy resulted in the development of nonenhancing tumor characterized by reduced diffusion and markedly decreased FMISO uptake in the setting of maintained CBF and CBV. These observations suggest that the dynamic biological interplay between tissue hypoxia and vascular normalization occurring within treated recurrent high grade glioma can be captured utilizing FMISO PET/MR imaging.

Title: [Differential diagnosis of brain gliomas by positron emission tomography using various radiopharmaceuticals].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To comparatively study the diagnostic capabilities of positron emission tomography (PET) with various tumorotropic radiopharmaceuticals (TRPs) in detecting malignant brain gliomas (BG) and estimating their degree. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients, including 47 with histologically verified glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 27 with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 23 with benign astrocytoma (BA), and 17 with postoperative cysts, were examined. PET was performed using TRPs: 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 11C-sodium butyrate (11C-SB), 11C-L-methionine (11C-MET), and 11C-choline (11C-COL). RESULTS: Malignant gliomas (GBM and AA) were clearly visualized by PET using 11C-MET, 11C-CHOL, and 11C-SB. 18F-FDG PET visualization of tumors was difficult because of increased RP accumulation in the cerebral cortex. WHO grades II-III gliomas were completely visualized by 11C-MET PET. Only some tumors were clearly displayed by PET with 11C-CHOL and 11C-SB. The accumulation indices (AI) obtained by 11C-CHOL PET in patients with malignant gliomas were, on average, 4.0- and 5.5-fold higher than those by 11C-MET and 11C-SB PET, respectively. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in AI obtained by "C-CHOL ("C-CHOL-AI) PET were first established between the patients with GBM (WHO grade IV) and those with AA (WHO grade III). CONCLUSION: 11C-CHOL PET is the most sensitive method to identify gliomas and estimate their grade. The advantage of 11C-MET PET is the possible imaging of the entire volume of viable tumor tissue.

Title: 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography for grading and estimation of prognosis in patients with intracranial gliomas.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Histopathological examination is the standard for grading and determination of diagnosis in intrinsic brain tumors though the possibility of malignization and tumor heterogeneity always bears the possibility of tumor under-grading or misjudgement regarding the estimation of prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of (18)F-FET-PET (FET-PET) for the grading and estimation of prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with intracranial gliomas in a clinical setting. METHODS: Patients who were treated for a newly diagnosed intracranial glioma between January 2007 and May 2012, and had a preoperative FET-PET and MRI scan between were included. The ratio of counts in a tumor VOI (volume of interest) with maximum uptake to the respective counts in a background VOI was calculated to provide the tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio. The clinical and histopathological data (tumor grading, pre- and postoperative neurological status, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale scores, and overall survival rates) were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients (39 WHO II, 26 WHO III, 87 WHO IV) were included. The median T/N ratio was 2.81 (1.1-8.1). The median T/N ratio of low-grade glioma patients was 1.65 (1.1-3.7), and 3.14 (1.61-8.1, p<0.001) in high-grade glioma patients. The median survival for patients with WHO III tumors was 22.8 months (95% CI: 15.87%-NA) and 13.23 months (95% CI: 10.83-15.6.%) for patients with WHO IV tumors (p=0.0001). For T/N</=1.6, no deaths were recorded; for 1.6<T/N</=3, median survival was 25.6 months (95% CI: 16.5%-NA), while for T/N>3, median survival was 14.0 months (95% CI: 11.7-16.2%, p<0.001). The test of the maximally selected log-rank statistic resulted in a T/N ratio of 1.88 as the cut-off value, with the greatest difference in overall survival between patients with longer and shorter survival. The ROC curve for differentiation of low- vs. high-grade tumors with regard to the T/N ratio showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.903. Regarding the prognostic validity for overall survival ROC-curves for 12-month, 24-month and 48-month survival display a higher validity for the WHO-classification than for the imaging modalities though with an AUC of 0.847 for the 48-month survival T/N ratio and MRI contrast-enhancement have a high prognostic value as well. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that FET-PET can predict prognosis and survival in patients harboring intracranial gliomas and serves as a valuable tool to supplement the established clinical and histopathological parameters.

Title: The 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator protein in human gliomas: an 11C-(R)PK11195 PET imaging and neuropathology study.
Abstract: The 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is upregulated in high-grade astrocytomas and can be imaged by PET using the selective radiotracer (11)C-(R)PK11195. We investigated (11)C-(R)PK11195 binding in human gliomas and its relationship with TSPO expression in tumor tissue and glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) within the tumors. METHODS: Twenty-two glioma patients underwent dynamic (11)C-(R)PK11195 PET scans and perfusion MR imaging acquisition. Parametric maps of (11)C-(R)PK11195 binding potential (BPND) were generated. Coregistered MR/PET images were used to guide tumor biopsy. The tumor tissue was quantitatively assessed for TSPO expression and infiltration of GAMs using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence. The imaging and histopathologic parameters were compared among different histotypes and grades and correlated with each other. RESULTS: BPND of (11)C-(R)PK11195 in high-grade gliomas was significantly higher than in low-grade astrocytomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas. TSPO in gliomas was expressed predominantly by neoplastic cells, and its expression correlated positively with BPND in the tumors. GAMs only partially contributed to the overall TSPO expression within the tumors, and TSPO expression in GAMs did not correlate with tumor BPND. CONCLUSION: PET with (11)C-(R)PK11195 in human gliomas predominantly reflects TSPO expression in tumor cells. It therefore has the potential to effectively stratify patients who are suitable for TSPO-targeted treatment.

Title: Glucose-corrected standardized uptake value in the differentiation of high-grade glioma versus post-treatment changes.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET ((18)F-FDG PET) are used widely to differentiate residual or recurrent high-grade gliomas from post-treatment changes in patients with brain tumors. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of SUV corrected by blood glucose level (SUV(gluc)) compared with various quantitative methods in this role. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 55 patients with dynamic F-FDG PET scans, there were 97 glioma lesions: glioblastoma (n=60), grade III gliomas (n=22), grade III or IV gliomas (n=6), grade I/II (n=7), and prebiopsy lesions (n=2). The final actual diagnosis was made on the basis of pathology (n=33) and clinical outcome (n=64). Dynamic F-FDG PET scans were processed to generate parametric images of SUV(gluc), SUV(max), and glucose metabolic rate (GMR). Lesion to cerebellum ratios (SUV(Rc)) and contralateral white matter ratios (SUV(Rw)) were also measured. The SUV(gluc) was calculated as SUV(max)xblood glucose level/100. RESULTS: Using the thresholds of SUV(max)>4.6, SUV(Rc)>0.9, SUV(Rw)>1.8, SUV(gluc)>4.3, and GMR>12.2 mumol/min/100 g to represent positivity for viable tumors, the accuracies were the same for the SUV(gluc) and SUV(Rw) (80%) and were higher than the conventional SUV(max) (72%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SUV(gluc) (0.8933) was better than that for the SUV(max) (0.8266) (P<0.01) and was similar to those of the GMR (0.8622), SUV(Rc) (0.8606), and SUV(Rw) (0.8981). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SUV(gluc) may aid in the differentiation of residual or recurrent high-grade tumor from post-treatment changes in patients with abnormal blood glucose levels. The simplicity of the SUV(gluc) avoids the complexity of kinetic analysis or the requirement of a reference tissue.

Title: Synthesis of [3-N-(11) C-methyl]temozolomide via in situ activation of 3-N-hydroxymethyl temozolomide and alkylation with [(11) C]methyl iodide.
Abstract: Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic drug that is mainly used in the treatment of primary glioblastoma multiforme and recurrent high-grade glioma. Here, we report an efficient good manufacturing practice compliant method for the synthesis of [3-N-(11) C-methyl]temozolomide from 3-N-hydroxymethyl temozolomide that cleaves off formaldehyde in situ and becomes activated towards alkylation with [(11) C]methyl iodide. The labelling method was developed for an on-going patient study in which the predictive value of [3-N-(11) C-methyl]temozolomide and positron emission tomography on the outcome of temozolomide treatment is being investigated. The precursor was reacted with [(11) C]methyl iodide in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in acetonitrile, heated at stepwise increasing temperature. Purification by semipreparative HPLC with pharmaceutical grade eluent and filtration gave approximately 10 mL sterile product solution ready for injection containing 1.55 +/- 0.38 GBq (n = 5), the specific activity was 88 +/- 25 GBq/micromol and the radiochemical purity was 98.5 +/- 1.9%. (13) C-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the labelled position after colabelling with (11) C and (13) C.

Title: (1)(8)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT as a complementary tool in the follow-up of low-grade glioma: diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The follow-up of treated low-grade glioma (LGG) requires the evaluation of subtle clinical changes and MRI results. When the result is inconclusive, additional procedures are required to assist decision-making, such as the use of advanced MRI (aMRI) sequences and nuclear medicine scans (SPECT and PET). The aim of this study was to determine whether incorporating (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT in the follow-up protocol for treated LGG improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. METHODS: This was a prospective case-series study in patients with treated LGG during standard follow-up with indeterminate clinical and/or radiological findings of tumour activity. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, aMRI, (201)Tl-SPECT and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT. Images were interpreted by visual evaluation complemented with semiquantitative analysis. RESULTS: Between January 2012 and December 2013, 18 patients were included in this study. The final diagnosis was established by histology (five surgical specimens, one biopsy specimen) or by consensus of the Neuro-Oncology Group (11 patients) after a follow-up of >6 months (mean 14.9 +/- 2.72 months). The global diagnostic accuracies were 90.9% for aMRI (38.8% inconclusive), 69.2 % for (201)Tl-SPECT (11.1% inconclusive), and 100% for (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT. (201)Tl-SPECT led correctly to a change in the initial approach in 38.9% of patients but might have led to error in 27.8%. The use of (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT alone rather than (201)Tl-SPECT led correctly to a change in the approach suggested by routine follow-up in 72.2% of patients and endorsed the approach in the remaining 27.8%. CONCLUSION: Our results support the need to complement structural MRI with aMRI and nuclear medicine procedures in selected patients. (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT can be useful in the individualized management of patients with treated LGG with uncertain clinical and/or radiological evidence of tumour activity.

Title: Assessment of grading in newly-diagnosed glioma using 18F-fluorothymidine PET/CT.
Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the proliferation activity in gliomas using 18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples of 26 tumors were analyzed (mean age=51.6; range=26-72 years; 16 males, 10 females). All examinations were performed using a PET/CT scanner equipped with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) detectors. All data were acquired with a delay of 15 min, following intravenous application of 18F-FLT (dosed 2 MBq/kg of body weight). The PET/CT contained CT after intravenous application of iodinated contrast agent and high-resolution brain PET acquired during 15 min in one position. PET/CT was performed before confirmation of the histological diagnosis and the level of 18F-FLT accumulation was compared to the grading of the tumor evaluated using immunohistochemistry staining of Ki-67. Samples were obtained by stereotactic biopsy (5x) or surgical resection (21x). RESULTS: Five tumors of grade IV, 7 tumors of grade III and 14 tumors of grade II were found. Pre-bioptical discrimination between high-grade and low-grade tumors reached accuracy 92.3% (24/26), sensitivity 92.3% (12/13) and specificity 92.9 (13/14). The mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in high-grade tumors was 2.23, significantly different from low-grade tumors (mean SUVmax 0.61, T=7.803, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: 18F-FLT-PET/CT enables to estimate the proliferation activity of glioma before biopsy.

Title: Oligodendroglial component complicates the prediction of tumour grading with metabolic imaging.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Previous radiological investigations have generally shown the superiority of metabolic imaging in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade glioma, but the presence of an oligodendroglial component may affect the diagnostic accuracy. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of PET imaging using (11)C-methionine (MET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade glioma, in correlation with the oligodendroglial component. METHODS: The study population comprised adult patients who underwent preoperative PET imaging using both MET and FDG within 1 week and successful excision of the tumour tissue, which confirmed WHO grade II-IV glioma. We examined the tumour metabolic activity in terms of lesion-to-normal uptake ratios (L/N ratio) in both MET PET and FDG PET images. We assessed the correlation between the imaging results and the histological findings to determine the diagnostic accuracy of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis in detecting high-grade tumours. RESULTS: We studied 46 patients with glioma (13 low-grade and 33 high-grade), including 26 with an oligodendroglial components. The L/N ratios of the PET images showed significantly higher metabolic activities in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas for both MET (4.29 +/- 1.22 and 2.36 +/- 0.72, respectively; p < 0.0001) and FDG (1.72 +/- 0.91 and 0.77 +/- 0.26, respectively; p = 0.0007) images, although significant overlaps in L/N ratio were observed between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. Excluding the 26 patents with an oligodendroglial component improved the separation for both MET (4.62 +/- 1.14 vs. 2.16 +/- 0.63; p < 0.001) and FDG (1.76 +/- 0.87 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.14; p < 0.05) images. The ROC analyses demonstrated the clinical utility of the metabolic radiotracers in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade gliomas, showing similar AUC values for MET (0.91) and FDG (0.92). Excluding the 26 patents with an oligodendroglial component also further improved the diagnostic accuracy for both MET (AUC 0.98), and FDG (AUC 1.00) images. The metabolic radiotracers were significantly correlated with the MIB-1 labelling index (R = 0.52, p < 0.05 for MET; R = 0.52, p < 0.05, for FDG) only in gliomas without an oligodendroglial component. CONCLUSION: For better characterization of gliomas and for risk assessment, the results of metabolic PET imaging should be revised after obtaining the pathological report, because oligodendroglial differentiation may positively influence the substrate metabolism and thus complicated the preoperative evaluation.

Title: Introduction of a standardized multimodality image protocol for navigation-guided surgery of suspected low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECT Surgery of suspected low-grade gliomas (LGGs) poses a special challenge for neurosurgeons due to their diffusely infiltrative growth and histopathological heterogeneity. Consequently, neuronavigation with multimodality imaging data, such as structural and metabolic data, fiber tracking, and 3D brain visualization, has been proposed to optimize surgery. However, currently no standardized protocol has been established for multimodality imaging data in modern glioma surgery. The aim of this study was therefore to define a specific protocol for multimodality imaging and navigation for suspected LGG. METHODS Fifty-one patients who underwent surgery for a diffusely infiltrating glioma with nonsignificant contrast enhancement on MRI and available multimodality imaging data were included. In the first 40 patients with glioma, the authors retrospectively reviewed the imaging data, including structural MRI (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences), metabolic images derived from PET, or MR spectroscopy chemical shift imaging, fiber tracking, and 3D brain surface/vessel visualization, to define standardized image settings and specific indications for each imaging modality. The feasibility and surgical relevance of this new protocol was subsequently prospectively investigated during surgery with the assistance of an advanced electromagnetic navigation system in the remaining 11 patients. Furthermore, specific surgical outcome parameters, including the extent of resection, histological analysis of the metabolic hotspot, presence of a new postoperative neurological deficit, and intraoperative accuracy of 3D brain visualization models, were assessed in each of these patients. RESULTS After reviewing these first 40 cases of glioma, the authors defined a specific protocol with standardized image settings and specific indications that allows for optimal and simultaneous visualization of structural and metabolic data, fiber tracking, and 3D brain visualization. This new protocol was feasible and was estimated to be surgically relevant during navigation-guided surgery in all 11 patients. According to the authors' predefined surgical outcome parameters, they observed a complete resection in all resectable gliomas (n = 5) by using contour visualization with T2-weighted or FLAIR images. Additionally, tumor tissue derived from the metabolic hotspot showed the presence of malignant tissue in all WHO Grade III or IV gliomas (n = 5). Moreover, no permanent postoperative neurological deficits occurred in any of these patients, and fiber tracking and/or intraoperative monitoring were applied during surgery in the vast majority of cases (n = 10). Furthermore, the authors found a significant intraoperative topographical correlation of 3D brain surface and vessel models with gyral anatomy and superficial vessels. Finally, real-time navigation with multimodality imaging data using the advanced electromagnetic navigation system was found to be useful for precise guidance to surgical targets, such as the tumor margin or the metabolic hotspot. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the authors defined a specific protocol for multimodality imaging data in suspected LGGs, and they propose the application of this new protocol for advanced navigation-guided procedures optimally in conjunction with continuous electromagnetic instrument tracking to optimize glioma surgery.

Title: 13N-ammonia combined with 18F-FDG could discriminate between necrotic high-grade gliomas and brain abscess.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Accurate prediction of brain abscess is beneficial for timely management. In this study, we investigated the utility of 13N-ammonia and its combination with 18F-FDG in differentiating brain abscess from necrotic high-grade gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with ring-like enhancement high-grade gliomas and 11 patients with brain abscess were recruited in our study. All of them underwent both 18F-FDG and 13N-ammonia PET imaging. Lesion uptake was evaluated by lesion to normal gray matter ratio (L/N). Histopathology diagnosis was obtained for all the patients after PET imaging. RESULTS: The L/N values of 18F-FDG were not significantly different between brain abscess and necrotic high-grade gliomas (P = 0.35). The uptake of 13N-ammonia in gliomas was higher than that in abscess lesions (L/N: 1.38 +/- 0.31 vs 0.84 +/- 0.18, P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the optimal L/N cutoff value (13N-ammonia) of 1.0 with the area under the curve of 0.94 and the overall accuracy of 87.5%. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that the combination of 18F-FDG and 13N-ammonia could distinguish the 2 clinical entities with higher accuracy of 95%, and only 1 necrotic glioma lesion was misclassified into the abscess group. CONCLUSIONS: 13N-ammonia is effective in distinguishing brain abscess from necrotic high-grade gliomas, and its combination with 18F-FDG could further elevate the diagnostic accuracy.

Title: Current standards and new concepts in MRI and PET response assessment of antiangiogenic therapies in high-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: Despite multimodal treatment, the prognosis of high-grade gliomas is grim. As tumor growth is critically dependent on new blood vessel formation, antiangiogenic treatment approaches offer an innovative treatment strategy. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has been in the spotlight of antiangiogenic approaches for several years. Currently, MRI including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images is routinely used to evaluate antiangiogenic treatment response (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria). However, by restoring the blood-brain barrier, bevacizumab may reduce T1 contrast enhancement and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, thereby obscuring the imaging-based detection of progression. The aim of this review is to highlight the recent role of imaging biomarkers from MR and PET imaging on measurement of disease progression and treatment effectiveness in antiangiogenic therapies. Based on the reviewed studies, multimodal imaging combining standard MRI with new physiological MRI techniques and metabolic PET imaging, in particular amino acid tracers, may have the ability to detect antiangiogenic drug susceptibility or resistance prior to morphological changes. As advances occur in the development of therapies that target specific biochemical or molecular pathways and alter tumor physiology in potentially predictable ways, the validation of physiological and metabolic imaging biomarkers will become increasingly important in the near future.

Title: Prognostic significance of dynamic 18F-FET PET in newly diagnosed astrocytic high-grade glioma.
Abstract: Despite advances in diagnosis and the use of different therapeutic regimens in astrocytic high-grade glioma (HGG), the prognosis for patients remains grim. Additional pretherapeutic information is needed to tailor management. To gain additional prognostic information at primary diagnosis, we investigated the value of dynamic O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 121 patients who had a primary diagnosis of astrocytic HGG (51 World Health Organization [WHO] grade III; 70 WHO IV) and underwent dynamic (18)F-FET PET before histopathologic assessment. We assessed static parameters (maximal and mean tumoral standardized uptake value corrected for mean background activity in the contralateral hemisphere [SUV(max)/BG and SUV(mean)/BG, respectively], biologic tumor volume) and dynamic time-activity curves, including minimal time to peak (TTP(min)). The prognostic influence of PET parameters and other clinical parameters on progression-free and overall survival was evaluated using uni- and multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: In the group overall, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.2 and 21.9 mo. SUV(max)/BG, SUV(mean)/BG, and biologic tumor volume were significantly higher in WHO IV than in WHO III gliomas; median TTP(min) was 12.5 min in both groups. On univariate analysis, the factors age, WHO grade, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status, contrast enhancement, initial treatment, and TTP(min) showed prognostic significance, with WHO grade, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status, age, and TTP(min) remaining significant in the multivariate analysis. WHO grade and TTP(min) reached a similar fit for the prognostic evaluation. The prognosis of WHO III astrocytoma with an early TTP(min) of 12.5 min or less did not differ significantly from that of glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: Early TTP(min) is associated with worse outcome in patients with newly diagnosed astrocytic HGG. In the preoperative setting, TTP(min) can be a valuable noninvasive prognostic marker with comparable significance to WHO grade. Additionally, TTP(min) can help identify highly aggressive WHO III astrocytoma tumors and may help in adjusting standard treatment toward an individualized, risk-adapted therapy regime.

Title: Impact of [18F]-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine PET imaging on target definition for radiation therapy of high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: We sought to assess the impact of amino-acid (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) on the volumetric target definition for radiation therapy of high-grade glioma versus the current standard using MRI alone. Specifically, we investigated the influence of tumor grade, MR-defined tumor volume, and the extent of surgical resection on PET positivity. METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive high-grade glioma patients (World Health Organization grades III-IV) with confirmed histology were scanned using FET-PET/CT and T1 and T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Gross tumor volume and clinical target volumes (CTVs) were defined in a blinded fashion based on MRI and subsequently PET, and volumetric analysis was performed. The extent of the surgical resection was reviewed using postoperative MRI. RESULTS: Overall, for  approximately  90% of the patients, the PET-positive volumes were encompassed by T1 MRI with contrast-defined tumor plus a 20-mm margin. The tumor volume defined by PET was larger for glioma grade IV (P < .001) and smaller for patients with more extensive surgical resection (P = .004). The margin required to be added to the MRI-defined tumor in order to fully encompass the FET-PET positive volume tended to be larger for grade IV tumors (P = .018). CONCLUSION: With an unchanged CTV margin and by including FET-PET for gross tumor volume definition, the CTV will increase moderately for most patients, and quite substantially for a minority of patients. Patients with grade IV glioma were found to be the primary candidates for PET-guided radiation therapy planning.

Title: Recurrence pattern analysis after re-irradiation with bevacizumab in recurrent malignant glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the recurrence pattern in patients with recurrent malignant glioma after re-irradiation in combination with bevacizumab as there is limited data on how to optimally choose dose, fractionation and delineation margins. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with re-irradiation and bevacizumab after previous chemoradiotherapy (concurrent temozolomide 75 mg/m(2)/d according to the EORTC/NCIC trial) and [(18) F]FET-PET and/or MRI confirmed recurrence were retrospectively analyzed. Bevacizumab was applied twice during fractionated re-irradiation (10 mg/kg, d1+d15, median 36 Gy, conventionally fractionated). Recurrence patterns were assessed by means of [(18) F]FET-PET and/or MRI. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 34.0 months for all patients [95%-CI, 27.7-40.3] and median post-recurrence survival 10.8 months [95%-CI, 9.2-12.4]. Concerning the recurrence patterns, 61.3% of these were located in-field (19 patients), 22.6% were marginal (7 patients) and 16.1% ex-field (5 patients). No influence on the recurrence pattern was observed according to sex, WHO grade, maintenance chemotherapy or MGMT methylation status whereas planning target volume (PTV) size had a significant influence on the recurrence pattern (p=0.032). PTV sizes>75 ml were associated with a higher in-field recurrence rate and lower median post-recurrence progression-free survival (8.5 vs. 4.9 months, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: After the administration of re-irradiation with bevacizumab the recurrence pattern seems to be mainly centrally located. The PTV size was the main predictor for a marginal/ex-field recurrence.

Title: A phase II trial of everolimus, temozolomide, and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: NCCTG N057K.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions within the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway as a critical modulator of cell survival. This clinical trial evaluated the combination of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus with conventional temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme were eligible for this single arm, phase II study. Everolimus (70 mg/wk) was started 1 week prior to radiation and TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ, and continued until disease progression. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months, and secondary endpoints were toxicity and time to progression. Eleven patients were imaged with 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)FLT)-PET/CT before and after the initial 2 doses of everolimus before initiating radiation/TMZ. Imaged patients with sufficient tumor samples also underwent immunohistochemical and focused exon sequencing analysis. RESULTS: This study accrued 100 evaluable patients. Fourteen percent of patients had grade 4 hematologic toxicities. Twelve percent had at least one grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity, and there was one treatment-related death. Overall survival at 12 months was 64% and median time to progression was 6.4 months. Of the patients who had (18)FLT-PET data, 4/9 had a partial response after 2 doses of everolimus. Focused exon sequencing demonstrated that (18)FLT-PET responders were less likely to have alterations within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR or tuberous sclerosis complex/neurofibromatosis type 1 pathway compared with nonresponders. CONCLUSION: Combining everolimus with conventional chemoradiation had moderate toxicity. (18)FLT-PET studies suggested an initial antiproliferative effect in a genetically distinct subset of tumors, but this did not translate into an appreciable survival benefit compared with historical controls treated with conventional therapy.

Title: Toward radioguided surgery with beta- decays: uptake of a somatostatin analogue, DOTATOC, in meningioma and high-grade glioma.
Abstract: A novel radioguided surgery (RGS) technique for cerebral tumors using beta(-) radiation is being developed. Checking for a radiotracer that can deliver a beta(-) emitter to the tumor is a fundamental step in the deployment of such a technique. This paper reports a study of the uptake of (90)Y-DOTATOC in meningiomas and high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and a feasibility study of the RGS technique in these types of tumor. Estimates were performed assuming the use of a beta(-) probe under development with a sensitive area 2.55 mm in radius to detect 0.1-mL residuals. METHODS: Uptake and background from healthy tissues were estimated on (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET scans of 11 meningioma patients and 12 HGG patients. A dedicated statistical analysis of the DICOM images was developed and validated. The feasibility study was performed using full simulation of emission and detection of the radiation, accounting for the measured uptake and background rate. RESULTS: All meningioma patients but one with an atypical extracranial tumor showed high uptake of DOTATOC. In terms of feasibility of the RGS technique, we estimated that by administering a 3 MBq/kg activity of radiotracer, the time needed to detect a 0.1-mL remnant with 5% false-negative and 1% false-positive rates is less than 1 s. Actually, to achieve a detection time of 1 s the required activities to administer were as low as 0.2-0.5 MBq/kg in many patients. In HGGs, the uptake was lower than in meningiomas, but the tumor-to-nontumor ratio was higher than 4, which implies that the tracer can still be effective for RGS. It was estimated that by administering 3 mBq/kg of radiotracer, the time needed to detect a 0.1-mL remnant is less than 6 s, with the exception of the only oligodendroma in the sample. CONCLUSION: Uptake of (90)Y-DOTATOC in meningiomas was high in all studied patients. Uptake in HGGs was significantly worse than in meningiomas but was still acceptable for RGS, particularly if further research and development are done to improve the performance of the beta(-) probe.

Title: Successful use of metronomic vinblastine and fluorothymidine pet imaging for the management of intramedullary spinal cord anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in a child.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Children with high-grade glioma still have a poor prognosis despite the use of multimodal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. New therapeutic strategies and methods evaluating such therapies are needed. OBSERVATION: Here we describe a child with anaplastic oligodendroglioma of the spinal cord who was unable to tolerate standard chemoradiotherapy and who had still-vital residual tumour during therapy. A good response was obtained with low-dose metronomic treatment containing vinblastine. The treatment was guided according to gradual response assessed using various positron-emission tomography tracers. CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic treatment guided by positron-emission tomography could be a reasonable option in some high-risk pediatric tumours.

Title: (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (1)(1)C-methionine positron emission tomography in relation to methyl-guanine methyltransferase promoter methylation in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Methylation status of the methyl-guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter is associated with a favorable response to a DNA alkylating agent in high-grade gliomas. We analyzed PET scans of patients with high-grade gliomas to determine whether the MGMT methylation status affects the tumor metabolic characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with high-grade glioma, who were initially examined with 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, were retrospectively enrolled. MET and FDG PET images were coregistered to each other and quantitative uptake of MET or FDG was assessed using tumor-to-normal uptake ratio of the cortex (TNR). TNRs for MET and FDG PET were compared between the two groups classified by MGMT promoter methylation status. RESULTS: Maximum TNR(FDG) of the MGMT methylated group was significantly higher than that of the MGMT unmethylated group (1.80+/-0.90 vs. 1.29+/-0.19; P=0.02). The MGMT methylated group also showed a trend for increased mean TNRFDG compared with the unmethylated group (0.85+/-0.21 vs. 0.72+/-0.11; P=0.10). There was no significant difference in TNR(MET) between the groups. In subgroup analyses with WHO grade 3 and 4, a trend for higher maximum TNR(FDG) was found in the MGMT methylated group compared with the unmethylated group. CONCLUSION: The MGMT methylated group showed higher glucose metabolism compared with the unmethylated group, whereas MET uptake did not show a significant difference. This suggests that MGMT methylation in high-grade gliomas could affect the tumor glucose metabolism. Thus, MGMT methylation status can cause a discrepancy in the prognostic prediction of high-grade gliomas by FDG PET, especially in patients scheduled for DNA alkylating chemotherapeutics.

Title: Dynamic 18F-FET PET in suspected WHO grade II gliomas defines distinct biological subgroups with different clinical courses.
Abstract: In suspected grade II gliomas, three distinct patterns of time-activity curves (TAC) on O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-1-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) have been delineated (i) increasing TAC homogeneously throughout the tumor, and decreasing TAC, (ii) either homogeneously throughout the tumor or (iii) only focally within otherwise increasing TAC patterns. Increasing TAC was associated with low-grade histology and decreasing TAC with high-grade histology. This prospective study analyzed whether these patterns correlate with distinct biological tumor subtypes and differential outcome. (18)F-FET PET-guided biopsies were used for stepwise histopathological evaluation. Molecular-genetic evaluation included O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutational and 1p/19q codeletion status. Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were obtained from multivariate regression models. 98 adult patients were included. Homogeneous increasing, focal decreasing and homogeneous decreasing TAC were seen in 51, 19 and 28 patients. The corresponding 1-year (2-years) PFS were 92% (85%), 89% (51%) and 50% (28%; p = 0.002). IDH1/2 mutations were more frequent in tumors with homogeneous increasing (90%) and focal decreasing (79%) TAC, but were rare in those exhibiting homogeneous decreasing TAC (25%; p < 0.001). Overall, TAC patterns, IDH1/2 mutational and 1p/19q codeletion status were powerful and independent prognostic factors. Dynamic (18)F-FET PET might be an important and independent imaging biomarker for patients with suspected WHO grade II gliomas and offers perspectives for stratified diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Tumors with focal decreasing TAC need highly targeted surgical interventions to avoid undergrading and undertreatment.

Title: Investigation on the role of integrated PET/MRI for target volume definition and radiotherapy planning in patients with high grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery MRI (FLAIR/MRI) and Carbon-11-labeled-methionine PET (11C-MET-PET) on high grade glioma (HGG) tumor volume delineation for radiotherapy planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with HGG were evaluated. The clinical target volumes (CTV1, generated by adding a 10mm margin to FLAIRMRI area, CTV2 by adding a 20mm margin to enhanced T1MRI) and biological target volume (BTV) were delineated on pre-operative MRI images and 11CMETPET respectively. RESULTS: The overlap between CTV1 and CTV2 showed a low correlation between the two volumes with CTV1 not always fully included into the CTV2. In all cases the whole BTV was included into the CTV1, while in 35/69 patients (50%) part of BTV was outside the CTV2 despite larger margins were added. In all cases recurrences were within the CTV1 volume and in 19/38 (50%) partially outside the CTV2. In all patients relapse corresponded to the BTV area. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the target volume definition using FLAIR-MRI is more adequate compared to enhanced T1MRI. 11C-METPET uptake could help identify microscopic residual areas.

Title: Can multiparametric MRI and FDG-PET predict outcome in diffuse brainstem glioma? A report from a prospective phase-II study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the impact of multiparametric MRI and (18)F-FDG-PET on the outcome of children with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from a phase-II prospective therapeutic study in children with newly diagnosed DIPG were considered for evaluation. They included baseline MRI with contrast enhancement before treatment. Functional imaging included MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and FDG-PET studies. All patients (n = 20) had baseline MRI and 11 patients had FDG-PET. Response was assessed by MRI and PET 4 weeks after therapy. Baseline imaging findings were correlated with survival. Presence or absence of adverse parameters on MRI (heterogeneous contrast enhancement, hyperperfusion or increased choline:NAA ratio) was used to develop a cumulative radiological prognostic index (RPI). Sensitivity and specificity of each imaging modality in tumour grading was estimated. RESULTS: The cumulative RPI was able to classify the patients into different grades and was predictive of overall survival (p = 0.02). MR perfusion also predicted survival (p = 0.039). Sensitivity and specificity of MRI and FDG-PET to detect low-grade gliomas were low to moderate (33-66%), but moderate to high in detecting high-grade gliomas (50-100%). Baseline FDG uptake on PET scan did not correlate with survival (p = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative RPI was able to classify tumours into different grades and predicted clinical outcome. At baseline, MR hyperperfusion indicated a shorter survival for DIPG patients. Sensitivity and specificity of imaging modalities to detect low-grade gliomas were poor.

Title: Spatial distribution of malignant tissue in gliomas: correlations of 11C-L-methionine positron emission tomography and perfusion- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis of glioma patients is contingent on precise target selection for stereotactic biopsies and the extent of tumor resection. (11)C-L-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates tumor heterogeneity and invasion with high diagnostic accuracy. PURPOSE: To compare the spatial tumor distribution delineated by MET PET with that by perfusion- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in order to understand the diagnostic value of these MRI methods, when PET is not available. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Presurgical MET PET and MRI, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI, were acquired in 13 patients (7 high-grade gliomas, 6 low-grade gliomas). A quantitative volume of interest analysis was performed to compare the modalities objectively, supplemented by a qualitative evaluation that assessed the clinical applicability. RESULTS: The inaccuracy of conventional MRI was confirmed (area under the curve for predicting voxels with high MET uptake = 0.657), whereas cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated from perfusion data improved accuracy (area under the curve = 0.760). We considered CBV maps diagnostically comparable to MET PET in 5/7 cases of high-grade gliomas, but insufficient in all cases of low-grade gliomas when evaluated subjectively. Cerebral blood flow and apparent diffusion coefficient maps did not contribute to further accuracy. CONCLUSION: Adding perfusion-weighted MRI to the presurgical protocol can increase the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI and is a simple and well-established method compared to MET PET. However, the definition of low-grade gliomas with subtle or no alterations on cerebral blood volume maps remains a diagnostic challenge for stand-alone MRI.

Title: (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (FCho), (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for the discrimination between high-grade glioma and radiation necrosis in rats: a PET study.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Discrimination between (high-grade) brain tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Metabolic imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. In this study, we investigated the potential of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG), O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET), and [(18)F]-Fluoromethyl-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium ((18)F-fluoromethylcholine, (18)F-FCho) PET in discriminating high-grade tumor from RN. METHODS: We developed a glioblastoma (GB) rat model by inoculating F98 GB cells into the right frontal region. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using three arcs with a beam aperture of 3x3 mm (n=3). Dynamic PET imaging with (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FET, and (18)F-FCho, as well as (18)F-FDG PET at a delayed time interval (240 min postinjection), was acquired. RESULTS: MRI revealed contrast-enhancing tumors at 15 days after inoculation (n=4) and contrast-enhancing RN lesions 5-6 months postirradiation (n=3). On (18)F-FDG PET, the mean lesion-to-normal ratio (LNRmean) was significantly higher in GB than in RN (p=0.034). The difference in the LNRmean between tumors and RN was higher on the late (18)F-FDG PET images than on the PET images reconstructed from the last time frame of the dynamic acquisition (this is at a conventional time interval). LNRs obtained from (18)F-FCho PET were not significantly different between GB and RN (p=1.000). On (18)F-FET PET, the LNRmean was significantly higher in GB compared to RN (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike (18)F-FCho, (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FET PET were effective in discriminating GB from RN. Interestingly, in the case of (18)F-FDG, delayed PET seems particularly useful. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: Our results suggest that (delayed) (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FET PET can be used to discriminate GB (recurrence) from RN. Confirmation of these results in clinical studies is needed.

Title: Clinical significance of tryptophan metabolism in the nontumoral hemisphere in patients with malignant glioma.
Abstract: alpha-(11)C-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) PET allows evaluation of brain serotonin synthesis and can also track upregulation of the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway in tumor tissue. Increased AMT uptake is a hallmark of World Health Organization grade III-IV gliomas. Our recent study also suggested decreased frontal cortical AMT uptake in glioma patients contralateral to the tumor. The clinical significance of extratumoral tryptophan metabolism has not been established. In the present study, we investigated clinical correlates of tryptophan metabolic abnormalities in the nontumoral hemisphere of glioma patients. METHODS: Standardized AMT uptake values (SUVs) and the uptake rate constant of AMT (K [mL/g/min], a measure proportional to serotonin synthesis in nontumoral gray matter) were quantified in the frontal and temporal cortex and thalamus in the nontumoral hemisphere in 77 AMT PET scans of 66 patients (41 men, 25 women; mean age +/- SD, 55 +/- 15 y) with grade III-IV gliomas. These AMT values were determined before treatment in 35 and after treatment in 42 patients and were correlated with clinical variables and survival. RESULTS: AMT uptake in the thalamus showed a moderate age-related increase before treatment (SUV, r = 0.39, P = 0.02) but decrease after treatment (K, r = -0.33, P = 0.057). Women had higher thalamic SUVs before treatment (P = 0.037) and higher thalamic (P = 0.013) and frontal cortical K values (P = 0.023) after treatment. In the posttreatment glioma group, high thalamic SUVs and high thalamocortical SUV ratios were associated with short survival in Cox regression analysis. The thalamocortical ratio remained strongly prognostic (P < 0.01) when clinical predictors, including age, glioma grade, and time since radiotherapy, were entered in the regression model. Long interval between radiotherapy and posttreatment AMT PET as well as high radiation dose affecting the thalamus were associated with lower contralateral thalamic or cortical AMT uptake values. CONCLUSION: These observations provide evidence for altered tryptophan uptake in contralateral cortical and thalamic brain regions in glioma patients after initial therapy, suggesting treatment effects on the serotonergic system. Low thalamic tryptophan uptake appears to be a strong, independent predictor of long survival in patients with previous glioma treatment.

Title: (11)C-choline PET/CT tumor recurrence detection and survival prediction in post-treatment patients with high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of (11)C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting tumor recurrence and predicting survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade gliomas. A total of 16 previously treated histopathologically proven high-grade glioma patients were subjected to (11)C-choline PET/CT scan and survival analysis. We found that the sensitivity and specificity of (11)C-choline PET/CT were 100 and 70 %, whereas those of Gd-MRI were 83.3 and 60 %, respectively. By Cox regression analysis, (11)C-choline T/N ratio correlated obviously with overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio = 2.644, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.027-6.807, p = 0.044) independent of Karnofsky performance score. Patients with lower T/N ratio (tumor uptake/normal brain tissue uptake) (</=1.42) had longer survival times than patients with higher T/N ratio (median OS = 15.4 vs. 5.3 months, p < 0.001; progression-free survival (PFS) =4.5 vs. 0.8 months, p = 0.004). Thus, this preliminary study suggests that (11)C-choline PET/CT is highly sensitive in detecting tumor recurrence in post-treatment patients with high-grade gliomas. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that T/N ratio measured by (11)C-choline maybe serves as a predictor of patients' survival with suspected recurrent glioma.

Title: Voxel-based clustered imaging by multiparameter diffusion tensor images for glioma grading.
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common intra-axial primary brain tumour; therefore, predicting glioma grade would influence therapeutic strategies. Although several methods based on single or multiple parameters from diagnostic images exist, a definitive method for pre-operatively determining glioma grade remains unknown. We aimed to develop an unsupervised method using multiple parameters from pre-operative diffusion tensor images for obtaining a clustered image that could enable visual grading of gliomas. Fourteen patients with low-grade gliomas and 19 with high-grade gliomas underwent diffusion tensor imaging and three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before tumour resection. Seven features including diffusion-weighted imaging, fractional anisotropy, first eigenvalue, second eigenvalue, third eigenvalue, mean diffusivity and raw T2 signal with no diffusion weighting, were extracted as multiple parameters from diffusion tensor imaging. We developed a two-level clustering approach for a self-organizing map followed by the K-means algorithm to enable unsupervised clustering of a large number of input vectors with the seven features for the whole brain. The vectors were grouped by the self-organizing map as protoclusters, which were classified into the smaller number of clusters by K-means to make a voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered image. Furthermore, we also determined if the diffusion tensor-based clustered image was really helpful for predicting pre-operative glioma grade in a supervised manner. The ratio of each class in the diffusion tensor-based clustered images was calculated from the regions of interest manually traced on the diffusion tensor imaging space, and the common logarithmic ratio scales were calculated. We then applied support vector machine as a classifier for distinguishing between low- and high-grade gliomas. Consequently, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves from the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images that showed the best performance for differentiating high- and low-grade gliomas were 0.848, 0.745, 0.804 and 0.912, respectively. Furthermore, the log-ratio value of each class of the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images was compared between low- and high-grade gliomas, and the log-ratio values of classes 14, 15 and 16 in the high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than those in the low-grade gliomas (p < 0.005, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). These classes comprised different patterns of the seven diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters. The results suggest that the multiple diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters from the voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered images can help differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas.

Title: (11)C-methinine uptake correlates with MGMT promoter methylation in nonenhancing gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Several studies have aimed to detect biomarkers in glioma using noninvasive imaging techniques. However, few studies have been able to image 1p/19q deletion by (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography ((11)C-methionine PET) or 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This study examines the correlation between (11)C-methionine uptake and MGMT promoter methylation in grade II and grade III nonenhancing gliomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 20 patients with grade II and III nonenhancing gliomas who underwent both MRI and (11)C-methionine PET as part of their pre-surgical examination. We examined MGMT promoter methylation by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: The mean MGMT promoter methylation for tumors with T/N ratios >/=1.6 was 28.0+/-26.3, and that for tumors with T/N ratios <1.6 was 0.68+/-0.89. The MGMT promoter methylation for tumors with T/N ratios >/=1.6 was significantly higher than that for tumors with T/N ratios <1.6 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A higher uptake in (11)C-methionine PET may reflect increased MGMT promoter methylation. (11)C-methionine PET could be a useful tool to detect MGMT promoter methylation in nonenhancing glioma.

Title: Comparison of the amino acid tracers 18F-FET and 18F-DOPA in high-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most common malignant primary tumors of the central nervous system. PET probes of amino acid transport such as O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET), 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA), and (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) detect primary and recurrent tumors with a high accuracy. (18)F-FET is predominantly used in Europe, whereas amino acid transport imaging is infrequently done in the United States. The aim of this study was to determine whether (18)F-FET and (18)F-DOPA PET/CT provide comparable information in HGG. METHODS: Thirty (18)F-FET and (18)F-DOPA PET/CT scans were obtained before surgery or biopsy in 27 patients with high clinical suspicion for primary or recurrent HGG (5 primary, 22 recurrent tumors). (18)F-FET and (18)F-DOPA PET/CT images were compared visually and semiquantitatively (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(max)], mean SUV [SUV(mean)]). Background (SUV(max) and SUV(mean)) and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated for both PET probes. The degree of (18)F-DOPA uptake in the basal ganglia (SUV(mean)) was also assessed. RESULTS: Visual analysis revealed no difference in tumor uptake pattern between the 2 PET probes. The SUV(mean) and SUV(max) for (18)F-FET were higher than those of (18)F-DOPA (4.0 +/- 2.0 and 4.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.6 and 4.3 +/- 2.0, respectively; all P < 0.001). TBRs for SUV(mean) but not for SUV(max) were significantly higher for (18)F-FET than (18)F-DOPA (TBR SUV(mean): 3.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2, P = 0.004; TBR SUV(max): 3.3 +/- 1.6 and 3.0 +/- 1.1, respectively; P = 0.086). (18)F-DOPA uptake by the basal ganglia was present (SUV(mean), 2.6 +/- 0.7) but did not affect tumor visualization. CONCLUSION: Whereas visual analysis revealed no significant differences in uptake pattern for (18)F-FET and (18)F-DOPA in patients with primary or recurrent HGG, both SUVs and TBRs for SUV(mean) were significantly higher for (18)F-FET. However, regarding tumor delineation, both tracers performed equally well and seem equally feasible for imaging of primary and recurrent HGG. These findings suggest that both PET probes can be used based on availability in multicenter trials.

Title: Re-irradiation of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme using 11C-methionine PET/CT/MRI image fusion for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy by intensity modulated radiation therapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: This research paper presents a valid treatment strategy for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy by intensity modulated radiation therapy (HS-IMRT) planned with 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET)/computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fusion. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with recurrent GBM received HS-IMRT planned by MET-PET/CT/MRI. The region of increased amino acid tracer uptake on MET-PET was defined as the gross tumor volume (GTV). The planning target volume encompassed the GTV by a 3-mm margin. Treatment was performed with a total dose of 25- to 35-Gy, given as 5- to 7-Gy daily for 5 days. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months, median overall survival time (OS) was 11 months from the start of HS-IMRT, with a 6-month and 1-year survival rate of 71.4% and 38.1%, respectively. Karnofsky performance status was a significant prognostic factor of OS as tested by univariate and multivariate analysis. Re-operation rate was 4.8% for radiation necrosis. No other acute or late toxicity Grade 3 or higher was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study of biologic imaging optimized HS-IMRT in recurrent GBM. HS-IMRT with PET data seems to be well tolerated and resulted in a median survival time of 11 months after HS-IMRT.

Title: (68)Ga-PRGD2 PET/CT in the evaluation of Glioma: a prospective study.
Abstract: Integrin alphavbeta3 is overexpressed in both neovasculature and glioma cells. We aimed to evaluate (68)gallium-BNOTA-PRGD2 ((68)Ga-PRGD2) as a new reagent for noninvasive integrin alphavbeta3 imaging in glioma patients. With informed consent, 12 patients with suspicious brain glioma, as diagnosed by enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, were enrolled to undergo (68)Ga-PRGD2 PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans before surgery. The preoperative images were compared and correlated with the pathologically determined WHO grade. Next, the expression of integrin alphavbeta3, CD34, and Ki-67 were determined by immunohistochemical staining of the resected brain tumor tissue. Our findings demonstrated that (68)Ga-PRGD2 specifically accumulated in the brain tumors that were rich of integrin alphavbeta3 and other neovasculature markers, but not in the brain parenchyma other than the choroid plexus. Therefore, (68)Ga-PRGD2 PET/CT was able to evaluate the glioma demarcation more specifically than (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of (68)Ga-PRGD2, rather than those of (18)F-FDG, were significantly correlated with the glioma grading. The maximum tumor-to-brain ratios (TBRmax) of both tracers were significantly correlated with glioma grading, whereas (68)Ga-PRGD2 seemed to be more superior to (18)F-FDG in differentiating high-grade glioma (HGG) from low-grade glioma (LGG). Moreover, (68)Ga-PRGD2 PET/CT showed different accumulation patterns for HGG of WHO grades III and IV. This is the first noninvasive integrin imaging study, to the best of our knowledge, conducted in preoperative patients with different grades of glioma, and it preliminarily indicated the effectiveness of this novel method for evaluating glioma grading and demarcation.

Title: Perfusion-metabolism coupling in recurrent gliomas: a prospective validation study with 13N-ammonia and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We assessed the validity of "perfusion-metabolism coupling" hypothesis in recurrent glioma with 13N-ammonia (13N-NH3) PET/CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (age, 38.8 +/- 12.1 years; 62.5% males) with histologically proven and previously treated glioma presenting with clinical suspicion of recurrence were prospectively enrolled and evaluated with 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT. PET/CT images were evaluated both qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Tumor to white matter uptake ratio (T/W) and tumor to gray matter uptake ratio (T/G) were calculated and analyzed for both the modalities. A combination of clinico-radiological follow-up, repeated imaging, and biopsy (when available) were considered as the reference standard. RESULTS: Based on the reference standard, 27/56 patients had recurrence. 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT were concordant in 55/56 patients. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 13N-NH3PET/CT were 77.8, 86.2, 84.0, 80.7, and 82.1%, respectively, and for 18F-FDG PET/CT were 77.8, 89.7, 87.5, 81.2, and 83.9%, respectively. There was excellent agreement between results of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (k = 0.964; P < 0.001). The performances of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT were not significantly different between high-grade and low-grade glioma (P = 1.000). A strong positive correlation was noted between the uptake ratios derived on the two modalities (rho = 0.866, P < 0.001 for T/W; rho = 0.918, P < 0.001 for T/G). CONCLUSION: A combination of 13N-NH3 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrates that perfusion and metabolism are coupled in recurrent gliomas. These tracers target two different but interrelated aspects of the same pathologic process and can be used as surrogates for each other.

Title: Hypofractionated high-dose irradiation with positron emission tomography data for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: This research paper presents clinical outcomes of hypofractionated high-dose irradiation by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (Hypo-IMRT) with (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) data for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A total of 45 patients with GBM were treated with Hypo-IMRT after surgery. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the area of enhanced lesion on MRI, including MET-PET avid region; clinical target volume (CTV) was the area with 5 mm margin surrounding the GTV; planning target volume (PTV) was the area with 15 mm margin surrounding the CTV, including MET-PET moderate region. Hypo-IMRT was performed in 8 fractions; planning the dose for GTV was escalated to 68 Gy and that for CTV was escalated to 56 Gy, while keeping the dose delivered to the PTV at 40 Gy. Concomitant and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy was administered. At a median follow-up of 18.7 months, median overall survival (OS) was 20.0 months, and median progression-free survival was 13.0 months. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 71.2% and 26.3%, respectively. Adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy was significantly predictive of OS on multivariate analysis. Late toxicity included 7 cases of Grade 3-4 radiation necrosis. Hypo-IMRT with MET-PET data appeared to result in favorable survival outcomes for patients with GBM.

Title: Prognostic value of 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine ([(18)F] FLT PET) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine ([(18)F] FLT) PET has been proven to be of value in diagnosis and assessment of glioma grading, in differentiating tumor recurrence from necrosis, in response assessment and in predicting overall survival (OS) in the primary high grade glioma. In this study, we evaluated the value of [(18)F] FLT PET-CT in predicting the OS of patients with recurrent malignant glioma. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with recurrent malignant glioma were enrolled in this prospective study. The PET-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI scans were performed in all patients. Tumor volume was determined from both PET image (proliferative volume, PV) and MRI image (Vol-MRI). Patients were followed up clinically until death. The likelihood of using PET-derived parameters of SUVmax, tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio, and PV to predict the OS of patients were assessed in comparison with Vol-MRI and other clinical parameters. RESULT: The follow up periods for all patients ranged from 1.5 to 35.6 months with median of 9.8 months. Univariate analysis showed that the following parameters were significantly correlated with OS: grade of primary tumor (p=0.042), Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (p=0.041), T/N ratio (p<0.01), Vol-MRI (p=0.041), and PV (p<0.001). However, multivariate Cox regression showed that only the PV (p<0.001) and T/N ratio (p=0.001) were independent predictors. The thresholds to predict OS were 16.88 cm(3) for PV and 10.94 for T/N ratio. Kaplan-Meier analyses using these thresholds showed a significant discrimination between short and long OS groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The PV and T/N ratio of tumor on [(18)F] FLT PET-CT are independent predictors of survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. The PV on [(18)F] FLT PET seems to be more predictive than tumor volume on T1-weighted MRI for OS.

Title: Prediction of glioma recurrence using dynamic (1)(8)F-fluoroethyltyrosine PET.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inter- and intratumor heterogeneity and the variable course of disease in patients with glioma motivate the investigation of new prognostic factors to optimize individual treatment. Here we explore the usefulness of standard static and more sophisticated dynamic (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine-PET imaging for the assessment of patient prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients with untreated, first-diagnosed, histologically proved glioma were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent dynamic PET scans before surgery (+/- standard treatment) and were followed up clinically and by MR imaging. Static and dynamic tumor-to-background ratio, TTP, and slope-to-peak were obtained and correlated with progression-free survival. RESULTS: Twenty of 34 patients experienced progression, with a median progression-free survival of 28.0 +/- 11.1 months. Dynamic TTP was highly prognostic for recurrent disease, showing a strong correlation with progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 6.050; 95% CI, 2.11-17.37; P < .001). Most interesting, this correlation also proved significant in the subgroup of low-grade glioma (hazard ratio, 5.347; 95% CI, 1.05-27.20; P = .044), but not when using established static imaging parameters, such as maximum tumor-to-background ratio and mean tumor-to-background ratio. In the high-grade glioma subgroup, both dynamic and static parameters correlated with progression-free survival. The best results were achieved by defining ROIs around "hot spots" in earlier timeframes, underlining the concept of intratumor heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine-PET can predict recurrence in patients with glioma, with dynamic analysis showing advantages over static imaging, especially in the low-grade subgroup.

Title: [PET in gliomas. Overview of current studies].
Abstract: Gliomas which represent 30% of intracranial tumours are morphologic lesions and therefore CT and MRI are the first line diagnostic procedures with MRI giving better soft tissue resolution and permitting additional functional information. These mainly morphologic imaging modalities yield only restricted information on grade of malignancy, on infiltration into and effects on surrounding brain tissue, on differentiation between necrotic and recurrent tumour, on prognosis and on efficacy of treatment. Information on these important issues for patient management can be obtained by PET-studies of glucose metabolism with FDG, of aminoacid-uptake and protein synthesis with 11C-methionin, 18F-fluorethyltyrosin and 18F-fluor-deoxyphenylalanin and of proliferation by 18F-deoxythymidin. With the increasing availability of 18F-tracers PET has obtained wider spread clinical application. In all these applications a coregistration with morphologic imaging should be obtained, and for that purpose hybrid installations (PET-MR) are already being used.

Title: Imaging and target volume delineation in glioma.
Abstract: Here we review current practices in target volume delineation for radical radiotherapy planning for gliomas. Current radiotherapy planning margins for glioma are informed by historic data of recurrence patterns using radiological imaging or post-mortem studies. Radiotherapy planning for World Health Organization grade II-IV gliomas currently relies predominantly on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences to identify the gross tumour volume (GTV). Isotropic margins are added empirically for each tumour type, usually without any patient-specific individualisation. We discuss novel imaging techniques that have the potential to influence radiotherapy planning, by improving definition of the tumour extent and its routes of invasion, thus modifying the GTV and allowing anisotropic expansion to a clinical target volume better reflecting areas at risk of recurrence. Identifying the relationships of tumour boundaries to important white matter pathways and eloquent areas of cerebral cortex could lead to reduced normal tissue complications. Novel magnetic resonance approaches to identify tumour extent and invasion include: (i) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance metrics; (ii) diffusion tensor imaging; and (iii) positron emission tomography, using radiolabelled amino acids methyl-11C-L-methionine and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine. Novel imaging techniques may also have a role together with clinical characteristics and molecular genetic markers in predicting response to therapy. Most significant among these techniques is dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which uses dynamic acquisition of images after injection of intravenous contrast. A number of studies have identified changes in diffusion and microvascular characteristics occurring during the early stages of radiotherapy as powerful predictive biomarkers of outcome.

Title: Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in detection of tumor recurrence in posttreatment of glioma: A diagnostic meta-analysis.
Abstract: It is important to distinguish between tumor recurrence and treatment effects in posttreatment patients with high-grade gliomas. Several imaging modalities have been reported in differentiating between tumor recurrence and treatment effects. However, there were no consistent conclusions between different studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 23 studies that compared the diagnostic values of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and (11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET (positron emission tomography) or PET/CT (computed tomography) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in predicting tumor recurrence of gliomas. The pooled estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and summary receiver operating characteristic curves of (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET or PET/CT and MRS in detecting tumor recurrence were calculated. In conclusion, MRS is highly sensitive in the detection of tumor recurrence in glioma.(18)F-FDG PET or PET/CT is highly specific in recurrence diagnosis. (11)C-MET does not have noticeable advantage over (18)F-FDG. The current evidence shows no statistical difference between MRS and PET on the accuracy.

Title: Correlation between (1)(8)F-fluoromisonidazole PET and expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Hypoxia and its consequences at the molecular level promote tumour progression and affect patient prognosis. One of the main early cellular events evoked by hypoxia is induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and subsequent upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study we sought to determine whether hypoxia detected by (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET accurately reflects the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the tumour and can be used as a biomarker of antiangiogenic treatment and as a prognostic factor in newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas. METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 32 patients with newly diagnosed glioma and 16 with recurrent glioma of grade III or grade IV. All the patients had undergone FMISO PET preoperatively. The maximum tumour-to-blood FMISO activity ratio (T/Bmax) was used to evaluate the degree of tumour hypoxia and the hypoxic volume (HV) was calculated using a tumour-to-blood FMISO uptake ratio of >/=1.2. Immunohistochemical expressions of HIF-1alpha and VEGF were evaluated semiquantitatively using the immunoreactivity score (IRS, scores 0 to 12) and the correlation was examined between IRS of HIF-1alpha or VEGF and FMISO uptake of the tumour (SUVtumour) using navigation-based sampling. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method in relation to the T/Bmax and the HV. RESULTS: The T/Bmax and the HV in grade IV gliomas were significantly higher than in grade III gliomas (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Moderate to strong HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression was observed in the majority of malignant gliomas. The IRS of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the tumour were not significantly different between grade III and grade IV gliomas. The IRS of HIF-1alpha in the tumour did not correlate with the SUVtumour of FMISO in either newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma. There was a significant but weak correlation between the IRS of VEGF and the SUVtumour of FMISO in newly diagnosed glioma, but not in recurrent glioma. The overall survival time in patients with a small HV and a low FMISO T/Bmax was significantly longer than in those with a large HV and a high FMISO T/Bmax (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Preoperative FMISO uptake is significantly correlated with the expression of VEGF in the tumour and might be used as a biomarker of antiangiogenic treatment in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. However, caution is required because the correlation was weak and there was a large overlap of FMISO uptake between glioma with high and low VEGF expression. In addition, hypoxia determined by FMISO PET appears to be a suitable biomarker for predicting a highly malignant tumour and a poor prognosis in patients with malignant glioma.

Title: Combination of MRI and dynamic FET PET for initial glioma grading.
Abstract: AIM: MRI and PET with 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) have been increasingly used to evaluate patients with gliomas. Our purpose was to assess the additive value of MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion imaging and dynamic FET-PET for glioma grading. PATIENTS, METHODS: 38 patients (42 +/- 15 aged, F/M: 0.46) with untreated histologically proven brain gliomas were included. All underwent conventional MRI, MRS, diffusion sequences, and FET-PET within 3+/-4 weeks. Performances of tumour FET time-activity-curve, early-to-middle SUVmax ratio, choline / creatine ratio and ADC histogram distribution pattern for gliomas grading were assessed, as compared to histology. Combination of these parameters and respective odds were also evaluated. RESULTS: Tumour time-activity-curve reached the best accuracy (67%) when taken alone to distinguish between low and high-grade gliomas, followed by ADC histogram analysis (65%). Combination of time-activity-curve and ADC histogram analysis improved the sensitivity from 67% to 86% and the specificity from 63-67% to 100% (p < 0.008). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, negative slope of the tumour FET time-activity-curve however remains the best predictor of high-grade glioma (odds 7.6, SE 6.8, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Combination of dynamic FET-PET and diffusion MRI reached good performance for gliomas grading. The use of FET-PET/MR may be highly relevant in the initial assessment of primary brain tumours.

Title: Tumor hypoxia and microscopic diffusion capacity in brain tumors: a comparison of (62)Cu-Diacetyl-Bis (N4-Methylthiosemicarbazone) PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MR imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between tumor hypoxia and microscopic diffusion capacity in primary brain tumors using (62)Cu-Diacetyl-Bis (N4-Methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-ATSM) PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI). METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional human research committee and was HIPAA compliant, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT and DWI were performed in a total of 40 primary brain tumors of 34 patients with low grade glioma (LGG, n = 13), glioblastoma (GBM, n = 20), and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL, n = 7). (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained by DWI were compared. RESULTS: High intensity signals by (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT and DWI in patients with GBM and PCNSL, and low intensity signals in LGG patients were observed. An inverse correlation was found between maximum SUV (SUVmax) and minimum ADC (ADCmin) (r = -0.583, p < 0.0001), and between tumor/brain ratio (T/Bratio) and ADCmin for all tumors (r = -0.532, p < 0.0001). Both SUVmax and T/Bratio in GBM were higher than LGG (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001), and those in PCNSL were also higher than GBM (p = 0.033 and p = 0.044). The ADCmin was lower in GBM (p = 0.011) and PCNSL (p = 0.01) than in LGG, while no significant difference was found between GBM and PCNSL (p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: Tumor hypoxia assessed by (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT correlated with microscopic diffusion capacity obtained by DWI in brain tumors. Both (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT and DWI were considered feasible imaging methods for grading glioma. However, (62)Cu-ATSM PET/CT provided additional diagnostic information to differentiate between GBM and PCNSL.

Title: Treatment response evaluation using 18F-FDOPA PET in patients with recurrent malignant glioma on bevacizumab therapy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: This study compares the value of 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI in assessing outcome during antiangiogenic treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty patients were prospectively studied with (18)F-FDOPA PET scans immediately before, and two and six weeks after start of bevacizumab therapy. (18)F-FDOPA metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) as well as max and mean standardized uptake values (SUV) within this MTV were obtained. MRI treatment response was assessed at six weeks. The predictive ability of (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI response assessment were evaluated with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 30, 28, and 24 (18)F-FDOPA PET scans at baseline, two weeks, and six weeks, were available for analysis, respectively. (18)F-FDOPA PET SUVs as well as their changes through therapy were not predictive of outcome. However, MTV parameters such as MTV changes were highly prognostic. Interestingly, absolute MTV at the first follow up scan provides the most significant prediction for increased OS (P < 0.0001) as well as PFS (P = 0.001). This surprising result was scrutinized with cross-validation and simulation analysis. Responders based on (18)F-FDOPA PET data survived 3.5 times longer (12.1 months vs. 3.5 months, median OS, P < 0.001) than nonresponders (17 patients vs. 11 patients, respectively). In comparison, responders based on MRI data lived 1.5 times longer (11.4 months vs 7.7 months, P = 0.03) than nonresponders (22 patients vs. 7 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDOPA PET identifies treatment responders to antiangiogenic therapy as early as two weeks after treatment initiation.

Title: Increased tryptophan uptake on PET has strong independent prognostic value in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previously, we demonstrated the high accuracy of alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) PET for differentiating recurrent gliomas from radiation injury. The present study evaluated the prognostic value of increased AMT uptake in patients with previously treated high-grade glioma. METHODS: AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients with suspected recurrence of World Health Organization grades III-IV glioma following surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) and unidirectional AMT uptake (K) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor and compared with the contralateral cortex (ie, background). Optimal cutoff thresholds for 1-year survival prediction were determined for each AMT parameter and used for calculating the prognostic value of high (above threshold) versus low (below threshold) values for post-PET overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In univariate analyses, 1-year survival was strongly associated with 3 AMT parameters (SUVmax, SUVmean, and tumor-to-background K-ratio; odds ratios: 21.3-25.6; P </= .001) and with recent change in MRI contrast enhancement (odds ratio: 14.7; P = .02). Median OS was 876 days in the low- versus 177 days in the high-AMT groups (log-rank P < .001). In multivariate analyses, all 3 AMT parameters remained strong predictors of survival: high AMT values were associated with unfavorable 1-year survival (binary regression P </= .003) and shorter overall survival in the whole group (Cox regression hazard ratios: 5.3-10.0) and in patients with recent enhancement change on MRI as well (hazard ratios: 7.0-9.3; P </= .001). CONCLUSION: Increased AMT uptake on PET is highly prognostic for 1-year and overall survival, independent of MRI contrast enhancement and other prognostic factors in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.

Title: Value of 18F-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET/MR image fusion in pediatric supratentorial infiltrative astrocytomas: a prospective pilot study.
Abstract: Infiltrative astrocytomas (IAs) represent a group of astrocytic gliomas ranging from low-grade to highly malignant, characterized by diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma. When compared with their adult counterpart, pediatric IAs may be considered biologically distinct entities; nevertheless, similarly to those in adults they represent a complex oncologic challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic role, clinical contribution, and prognostic value of fused (18)F-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET/MR images in pediatric supratentorial IAs. METHODS: Pediatric patients with supratentorial IAs involving at least 2 cerebral lobes, either newly diagnosed or with suspected disease progression, prospectively underwent (18)F-DOPA PET and conventional MR imaging, performed within 10 d of each other. (18)F-DOPA PET data were interpreted qualitatively and semiquantitatively, fusing images with MR images. PET scans were classified as positive if tumors identified on MR imaging exhibited tracer uptake above the level of the corresponding contralateral normal brain. Maximum standardized uptake values, tumor-to-normal contralateral tissue ratios, and tumor-to-normal striatum ratios were calculated for all tumors. Correlations between the degree and extent of (18)F-DOPA uptake, MR imaging tumor characteristics, and histologic results were investigated. The contribution of (18)F-DOPA PET/MR image fusion was considered relevant if it enabled one to select the most appropriate biopsy site, discriminate between disease progression and treatment-related changes, or influence treatment strategy. The patient's outcome was finally correlated with (18)F-DOPA uptake. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (8 boys and 5 girls) were included (5 diffuse astrocytomas, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas, 5 gliomatosis cerebri, and 1 glioblastoma multiforme). The (18)F-DOPA uptake pattern was heterogeneous in all positive scans (9/13), revealing metabolic heterogeneities within each tumor. Significant differences in terms of (18)F-DOPA uptake were found between low- and high-grade lesions (P < 0.05). The diagnostic and therapeutic contribution of (18)F-DOPA PET/MR image fusion was relevant in 9 of 13 patients (69%). (18)F-DOPA uptake correlated significantly with progression-free survival (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that (18)F-DOPA PET/MR image fusion may be a reliable imaging biomarker of pediatric IAs. Information gathered by this combined imaging approach can be readily transferred to the everyday practice and may help clinicians to better stratify patients with IAs, especially diffuse astrocytomas and gliomatosis cerebri, for diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic purposes.

Title: [ (11) C]-methionine positron emission tomography in the postoperative imaging and followup of patients with primary and recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of [(11)C]-methionine positron emission tomography ([(11)C]-MET PET) in the management of glioma patients. We retrospectively analysed data from 53 patients with primary gliomas (16 low grade astrocytomas, 15 anaplastic astrocytomas and 22 glioblastomas) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > 70. Patients underwent [(11)C]-MET PET scans (N = 249) and parallel contrast-enhanced MRI (N = 193) and/or CT (N = 113) controls. In low grade glioma patients, MRI or CT findings associated with [(11)C]-MET PET additional data allowed discrimination residual disease from postsurgical changes in 96.22% of these cases. [(11)C]-MET PET early allowed detection of malignant progression from low grade to anaplastic astrocytoma with high sensitivity (91.56%) and specificity (95.18%). In anaplastic astrocytomas, we registered high sensitivity (93.97%) and specificity (95.18%) in the postoperative imaging and during the followup of these patients. In GBM patients, CT and/or MRI scans with additional [(11)C]-MET PET data registered a sensitivity of 96.92% in the postsurgical evaluation and in the tumour assessment during temozolomide therapy. A significant correlation was found between [(11)C]-MET mean uptake index and histologic grading (P < 0.001). These findings support the notion that complementary information derived from [(11)C]-MET PET may be helpful in postoperative and successive tumor assessment of glioma patients.

Title: Applications of positron emission tomography in neuro-oncology: a clinical approach.
Abstract: The field of neuro-oncology is concerned with some of the most challenging and difficult to treat conditions in medicine. Despite modern therapies patients diagnosed with primary brain tumours often have a poor prognosis. Imaging can play an important role in evaluating the disease status of such patients. In addition to the structural information derived from MRI and CT scans, positron emission tomography (PET) provides important quantitative metabolic assessment of brain tumours. This review describes the use of PET with radiolabelled glucose and amino acid analogues to aid in the diagnosis of tumours, differentiate between recurrent tumour and radiation necrosis and guide biopsy or treatment. [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the tracer that has been used most widely because it has a 2 h half life and can be transported to imaging centres remote from the cyclotron and radiochemistry facilities which synthesise the tracers. The high uptake of FDG in normal grey matter however limits its use in some low grade tumours which may not be visualised. [(11)C] methionine (MET) is an amino acid tracer with low accumulation in normal brain which can detect low grade gliomas, but its short 20 min half life has limited its use to imaging sites with their own cyclotron. The emergence of new fluorinated amino acid tracers like [(18)F]Fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) will likely increase the availability and utility of PET for patients with primary brain tumours. PET can, further, characterise brain tumours by investigating other metabolic processes such as DNA synthesis or thymidine kinase activity, phospholipid membrane biosynthesis, hypoxia, receptor binding and oxygen metabolism and blood flow, which will be important in the future assessment of targeted therapy.

Title: FLT-PET in previously untreated patients with low-grade glioma can predict their overall survival.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (LGG) of the brain have an uncertain prognosis, as many of them show continuous growth or upgrade over the course of time. We retrospectively investigated the role of positron emission tomography with 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT-PET) in the prediction of overall survival and event free survival in patients with untreated LGG. No such information is yet available in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with previously untreated LGG underwent 55 FLT-PET investigations during their follow-up because of subjective complaints, objective worsening of clinical conditions, equivocal findings or progression on magnetic resonance imaging. The time interval before referral for neurosurgical or radiation treatment was considered to be event free survival, the interval until death as overall survival, respectively. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were measured, and a 3-point scale of subjective assessment was also applied. ROC analysis was used to define cut-off values. The log rank test was used for comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Eight patients (a total of 9 FLT-PET studies performed) died during follow-up. Progression leading to referral to therapy was recorded in 24 patients (a total of 33 FLT-PET studies). With a cut-off value of SUV(mean) = 0.236, a median overall survival of 1.007 days was observed in the test positive subgroup while median overall survival for the test negative subgroup was not achieved (p = 0.0002), hazard ratio = 17.6. Subjective assessment resulted in hazard ratio 11.5 (p = 0.0001). Only marginal significance (p=0.0562) was achieved in prediction of event free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Increased FLT uptake in previously untreated patients with LGG is a strong predictor of overall survival. On the other hand, prediction of event free survival was not successful in our cohort, probably because of high prevalence of patients who needed treatment due to symptoms caused by a space-occupying lesion without respect to the proliferative activity of the tumour.

Title: (1)(8)F-FLT    and (1)(8)F-FDOPA PET kinetics in recurrent brain tumors.
Abstract: PURPOSE: In this study, kinetic parameters of the cellular proliferation tracer (18)F-3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-L-thymidine (FLT) and the amino acid probe 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) were measured before and early after the start of therapy, and were used to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent malignant glioma using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. METHODS: High-grade recurrent brain tumors in 21 patients (11 men and 10 women, age range 26 - 76 years) were investigated. Each patient had three dynamic PET studies with each probe: at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks from the start of treatment. Treatment consisted of biweekly cycles of bevacizumab (an angiogenesis inhibitor) and irinotecan (a chemotherapeutic agent). For each study, about 3.5 mCi of FLT (or FDOPA) was administered intravenously and dynamic PET images were acquired for 1 h (or 35 min for FDOPA). A total of 126 PET scans were analyzed. A three-compartment, two-tissue model was applied to estimate tumor FLT and FDOPA kinetic rate constants using a metabolite- and partial volume-corrected input function. MLR analysis was used to model OS as a function of FLT and FDOPA kinetic parameters for each of the three studies as well as their relative changes between studies. An exhaustive search of MLR models using three or fewer predictor variables was performed to find the best models. RESULTS: Kinetic parameters from FLT were more predictive of OS than those from FDOPA. The three-predictor MLR model derived using information from both probes (adjusted R(2) = 0.83) fitted the OS data better than that derived using information from FDOPA alone (adjusted R(2) = 0.41), but was only marginally different from that derived using information from FLT alone (adjusted R(2) = 0.82). Standardized uptake values (either from FLT alone, FDOPA alone, or both together) gave inferior predictive results (best adjusted R(2) = 0.25). CONCLUSION: For recurrent malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan, FLT kinetic parameters obtained early after the start of treatment (absolute values and their associated changes) can provide sufficient information to predict OS with reasonable confidence using MLR. The slight increase in accuracy for predicting OS with a combination of FLT and FDOPA PET information may not warrant the additional acquisition of FDOPA PET for therapy monitoring in patients with recurrent glioma.

Title: 18F-DOPA, a clinically available PET tracer to study brain inflammation?
Abstract: We report 2 cases of suspected low-grade glioma with positive 18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) PET scan, and histological diagnosis of brain inflammation corresponding to an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and to a neurosarcoidosis. It has been shown that this amino-acid PET radiotracer serves to evaluate tumoral proliferation related to the metabolism of L-amino-acid transporters, and that inflammation may also contribute to the tumoral uptake. This report suggests it may serve to study brain inflammation.

Title: Focal changes in diffusivity on apparent diffusion coefficient MR imaging and amino acid uptake on PET do not colocalize in nonenhancing low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) may harbor malignant foci, which are characterized by increased tumor cellularity and angiogenesis. We used diffusion-weighted MR imaging (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) and PET with the amino acid O-(2-(18)F-fluorethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) to search for focal changes of diffusion (ADC) and amino acid uptake and to investigate whether focal changes in these parameters colocalize within LGGs. METHODS: We retrospectively selected 18 patients with nonenhancing LGG. All patients had undergone (18)F-FET PET and MR imaging for preoperative evaluation or for therapy monitoring in recurrent or progressive LGG. Region-of-interest analysis was performed to compare (18)F-FET uptake and ADC values in areas with focal intratumoral maximum metabolic activity and diffusion restriction and between tumor and normal brain. (18)F-FET uptake was normalized to the mean cerebellar uptake (ratio). ADC values were also compared with the (18)F-FET uptake on a voxel-by-voxel basis across the whole tumor. RESULTS: The mean focal maximum (mean +/- SD, 1.69 +/- 0.85) and global (18)F-FET uptake in tumors (1.14 +/- 0.41) exceeded that of normal cortex (0.85 +/- 0.09) and cerebrospinal fluid (0.82 +/- 0.20). ADC values in the area with most restricted diffusion (1.07 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and in the whole tumor (1.38 +/- 0.27 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were in the range between normal cortex (0.73 +/- 0.06 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and cerebrospinal fluid (2.84 +/- 0.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). (18)F-FET uptake did not correlate with corresponding (colocalizing) ADC values, either in the area with focal maximum metabolic activity or in the area with most restricted diffusion or in the whole tumor. CONCLUSION: There is no congruency between (18)F-FET uptake and diffusivity in nonenhancing LGG. Diffusion restriction in these tumors most likely represents changes in brain and tumor cell densities as well as alteration of water distribution and is probably not directly correlated with the density of tumor cells.

Title: Pharmacokinetic analysis and uptake of 18F-FBPA-Fr after ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier disruption for potential enhancement of boron delivery for neutron capture therapy.
Abstract: Boronophenylalanine has been applied in clinical boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 4-borono-2-(18)F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine-fructose ((18)F-FBPA-Fr) in F98 glioma-bearing Fischer 344 rats by means of intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr both with and without blood-brain barrier disruption (BBB-D) induced by focused ultrasound (FUS). METHODS: Dynamic PET imaging of (18)F-FBPA-Fr was performed on the ninth day after tumor implantation. Blood samples were collected to obtain an arterial input function for tracer kinetic modeling. Ten animals were scanned for approximately 3 h to estimate the uptake of (18)F radioactivity with respect to time for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Rate constants were calculated by use of a 3-compartment model. RESULTS: The accumulation of (18)F-FBPA-Fr in brain tumors and the tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio were significantly elevated after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with BBB-D. (18)F-FBPA-Fr administration after sonication showed that the tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio for the sonicated tumors (3.5) was approximately 1.75-fold higher than that for the control tumors (2.0). Furthermore, the K1/k2 pharmacokinetic ratio after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with BBB-D was significantly higher than that after intravenous injection without BBB-D. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that radioactivity in tumors and the tumor-to-normal brain ratio after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA-Fr with sonication were significantly higher than those in tumors without sonication. The K1/k2 ratio may be useful for indicating the degree of BBB-D induced by FUS. Further studies are needed to determine whether FUS may be useful for enhancing the delivery of boronophenylalanine in patients with high-grade gliomas.

Title: The demonstration of extension of high-grade glioma beyond magnetic resonance imaging defined edema by the use of (11) C-methionine positron emission tomography.
Abstract: The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard for the delineation of target volumes for high-grade gliomas (HGG). While the peritumoral edema as per T2-weighted (T2W) imaging is utilized as basis to delineate the initial borders of the clinical target volume (CTV), those areas enhancing on T1-weighted (T1W) images with gadolinium contrast (T1-Gd) are considered for treatment with further boost. However, recent data has emerged concerning the use of positron emission tomography (PET) with 11 C-methionine, which seemingly provides additional information beyond MRI. We present the case of a gentleman with an inoperable HGG which was imaged with 11 C-methionine-PET ( 11 C-MET-PET)/CT as well as MRI as part of the radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP) process. The differences noted between the MRI and the PET defined volumes are presented. This being a patient who was not operated, the potentially confounding issue of surgery-induced PET-avidity is absent.

Title: Radiotherapy of high-grade gliomas: current standards and new concepts, innovations in imaging and radiotherapy, and new therapeutic approaches.
Abstract: The current standards in radiotherapy of high-grade gliomas (HGG) are based on anatomic imaging techniques, usually computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The guidelines vary depending on whether the HGG is a histological grade 3 anaplastic glioma (AG) or a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For AG, T2-weighted MRI sequences plus the region of contrast enhancement in T1 are considered for the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV), and an isotropic expansion of 15 to 20 mm is recommended for the clinical target volume (CTV). For GBM, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group favors a two-step technique, with an initial phase (CTV1) including any T2 hyperintensity area (edema) plus a 20 mm margin treated with up to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a reduction in CTV2 to the contrast enhancement region in T1 with an additional 25 mm margin. The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer recommends a single-phase technique with a unique GTV, which comprises the T1 contrast enhancement region plus a margin of 20 to 30 mm. A total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions is usually delivered for GBM, and a dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions is typically given for AG. As more than 85% of HGGs recur in field, dose-escalation studies have shown that 70 to 75 Gy can be delivered in 6 weeks with relevant toxicities developing in <10% of the patients. However, the only randomized dose-escalation trial, in which the boost dose was guided by conventional MRI, did not show any survival advantage of this treatment over the reference arm. HGGs are amongst the most infiltrative and heterogeneous tumors, and it was hypothesized that the most highly aggressive areas were missed; thus, better visualization of these high-risk regions for radiation boost could decrease the recurrence rate. Innovations in imaging and linear accelerators (LINAC) could help deliver the right doses of radiation to the right subvolumes according to the dose-painting concept. Advanced imaging techniques provide functional information on cellular density (diffusion MRI), angiogenesis (perfusion MRI), metabolic activity and cellular proliferation [positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)]. All of these non-invasive techniques demonstrated good association between the images and histology, with up to 40% of HGGs functionally presenting a high activity within the non-contrast-enhanced areas in T1. New LINAC technologies, such as intensity-modulated and stereotactic radiotherapy, help to deliver a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) > 60 Gy. Trials delivering a SIB into a biological GTV showed the feasibility of this treatment, but the final results, in terms of clinical benefits for HGG patients, are still pending. Many issues have been identified: the variety of MRI and PET machines (and amino-acid tracers), the heterogeneity of the protocols used for image acquisition and post-treatment, the geometric distortion and the unreliable algorithms for co-registration of brain anatomy with functional maps, and the semi-quiescent but highly invasive HGG cells. These issues could be solved by the homogenization of the protocols and software applications, the simultaneous acquisition of anatomic and functional images (PET-MRI machines), the combination of complementary imaging tools (perfusion and diffusion MRI), and the concomitant addition of some ad hoc targeted drugs against angiogenesis and invasiveness to chemoradiotherapy. The integration of these hybrid data will construct new synthetic metrics for fully individualized treatments.

Title: Dynamic 18F-FET PET in newly diagnosed astrocytic low-grade glioma identifies high-risk patients.
Abstract: Because the clinical course of low-grade gliomas in the individual adult patient varies considerably and is unpredictable, we investigated the prognostic value of dynamic (18)F-fluorethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in the early diagnosis of astrocytic low-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade II). METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with newly diagnosed low-grade glioma and dynamic (18)F-FET PET before histopathologic assessment were retrospectively investigated. (18)F-FET PET analysis comprised a qualitative visual classification of lesions; assessment of the semiquantitative parameters maximal, mean, and total standardized uptake value as ratio to background and biologic tumor volume; and dynamic analysis of intratumoral (18)F-FET uptake over time (increasing vs. decreasing time-activity curves). The correlation between PET parameters and progression-free survival, overall survival, and time to malignant transformation was investigated. RESULTS: (18)F-FET uptake greater than the background level was found in 34 of 59 tumors. Dynamic (18)F-FET uptake analysis was available for 30 of these 34 patients. Increasing and decreasing time-activity curves were found in 18 and 12 patients, respectively. Neither the qualitative factor presence or absence of (18)F-FET uptake nor any of the semiquantitative uptake parameters significantly influenced clinical outcome. In contrast, decreasing time-activity curves in the kinetic analysis were highly prognostic for shorter progression-free survival and time to malignant transformation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Absence of (18)F-FET uptake in newly diagnosed astrocytic low-grade glioma does not generally indicate an indolent disease course. Among the (18)F-FET-positive gliomas, decreasing time-activity curves in dynamic (18)F-FET PET constitute an unfavorable prognostic factor in astrocytic low-grade glioma and, by identifying high-risk patients, may ease treatment decisions.

Title: Molecular and metabolic pattern classification for detection of brain glioma progression.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The ability to differentiate between brain tumor progression and radiation therapy induced necrosis is critical for appropriate patient management. In order to improve the differential diagnosis, we combined fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) and histological data to develop a multi-parametric machine-learning model. METHODS: We enrolled twelve post-therapy patients with grade 2 and 3 gliomas that were suspicious of tumor progression. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET and (1)H MRS. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumors and reference regions were obtained. Multiple 2D maps of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) of the tumors were generated. A support vector machine (SVM) learning model was established to take imaging biomarkers and histological data as input vectors. A combination of clinical follow-up and multiple sequential MRI studies served as the basis for assessing the clinical outcome. All vector combinations were evaluated for diagnostic accuracy and cross validation. The optimal cutoff value of individual parameters was calculated using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. RESULTS: The SVM and ROC analyses both demonstrated that SUVmax of the lesion was the most significant single diagnostic parameter (75% accuracy) followed by Cho concentration (67% accuracy). SVM analysis of all paired parameters showed SUVmax and Cho concentration in combination could achieve 83% accuracy. SUVmax of the lesion paired with SUVmax of the white matter as well as the tumor Cho paired with the tumor Cr both showed 83% accuracy. These were the most significant paired diagnostic parameters of either modality. Combining all four parameters did not improve the results. However, addition of two more parameters, Cho and Cr of brain parenchyma contralateral to the tumor, increased the accuracy to 92%. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that SVM models may improve detection of glioma progression more accurately than single parametric imaging methods.

Title: Intra-individual comparison of (1)(8)F-FET and (1)(8)F-DOPA in PET imaging of recurrent brain tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Both (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) and (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET) have already been used successfully for imaging of brain tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between these 2 promising tracers to determine the consequences for imaging protocols and the interpretation of findings. METHODS: Forty minutes of dynamic PET imaging were performed on 2 consecutive days with both (18)F-DOPA and (18)F-FET in patients with recurrent low-grade astrocytoma (n = 8) or high-grade glioblastoma (n = 8). Time-activity-curves (TACs), standardized uptake values (SUVs) and compartment modeling of both tracers were analyzed, respectively. RESULTS: The TAC of DOPA-PET peaked at 8 minutes p.i. with SUV 5.23 in high-grade gliomas and 10 minutes p.i. with SUV 4.92 in low-grade gliomas. FET-PET peaked at 9 minutes p.i. with SUV 3.17 in high-grade gliomas and 40 minutes p.i. with SUV 3.24 in low-grade gliomas. Neglecting the specific uptake of DOPA into the striatum, the tumor-to-brain and tumor-to-blood ratios were higher for DOPA-PET. Kinetic modeling demonstrated a high flow constant k1 (mL/ccm/min), representing cellular internalization through AS-transporters, for DOPA in both high-grade (k1 = 0.59) and low-grade (k1 = 0.55) tumors, while lower absolute values and a relevant dependency from tumor-grading (high-grade k1 = 0.43; low-grade k1 = 0.33) were observed with FET. CONCLUSIONS: DOPA-PET demonstrates superior contrast ratios for lesions outside the striatum, but SUVs do not correlate with grading. FET-PET can provide additional information on tumor grading and benefits from lower striatal uptake but presents lower contrast ratios and requires prolonged imaging if histology is not available in advance due to a more variable time-to-peak.

Title: Comparison of (11)C-methionine, (11)C-choline, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET for distinguishing glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis.
Abstract: The aim of this study is to assess the different metabolic activities characteristic of glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis (RN) and to explore the diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of the two conditions using (11)C-methionine (MET), (11)C-choline (CHO), and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). Fifty patients with lesions suggestive of recurrent glioma by MRI underwent MET, CHO, and FDG-PET. All patients who had previously been treated with radiotherapy for malignant glioma were subjected to open surgery and pathological diagnosis (17 recurrent grade 3- gliomas (Gr.3s) comprising 7 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and 10 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AOs), 17 recurrent glioblastomas (Gr.4s), and 16 RNs). We measured the PET/Gd volume ratio, the PET/Gd overlap ratio, and the lesion/normal brain uptake ratio (L/N ratio) and determined the optimal index of each PET scan. The PET/Gd volume ratio and the PET/Gd overlap ratio for RN were significantly lower than those of glioma recurrence only with MET-PET (P < 0.05). The L/N ratio of RN was significantly lower than that of Gr.4 with all PET imaging (P < 0.001) and was significantly lower than that of Gr.3, especially for AO, only with MET-PET images (P < 0.005). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the curve of MET, CHO, and FDG was 92.5, 81.4, and 77.4, respectively. MET L/N ratio of greater than 2.51 provided the best sensitivity and specificity for establishing glioma recurrence (91.2% and 87.5%, respectively). These results demonstrated that MET-PET was superior to both CHO and FDG-PET for diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing glioma recurrence from RN.

Title: O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine uptake is an independent prognostic determinant in patients with glioma referred for radiation therapy.
Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) uptake intensity in World Health Organisation (WHO) tumor grade II-IV gliomas. METHODS: We studied 28 patients with WHO tumor grade II-IV gliomas who were referred to our department for radiation therapy. We acquired a FET-PET in all patients, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain consisting of at least T2-weighted imaging, flair and pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging. SUVmax was measured and the tumor-to-brain uptake ratio (TBR) of all lesions was calculated based on the SUVmax (TBRmax) or SUVmean (TBRmean) of the contralateral healthy tissue. For this study, volumes were calculated using MRI alone, MRI + the volume with a SUVmax on FET-PET >/= 2.2 as well as MRI + the volume with an uptake of at least 40 % of the SUVmax. RESULTS: Tumor volumes were a median (range) of 88.6 (2.6-467.4) ml (MRI alone), 84.2 (2.8-474.4) ml (MRI + SUVmax on FET-PET >/= 2.2) and 101.5 (4.0-512.1) ml (MRI + FET-PET uptake >/= 40 % SUVmax), respectively. TBR-SUVmean was 2.36 (1.46-4.08); TBR-SUVmax was 1.71 (0.97-2.85). During a follow-up of 18.7 (2.5-36.1) months after FET-PET, 12 patients died of malignant glioma. Patients with a SUVmax >/= 2.6 had a significantly worse tumor-related mortality (p = 0.005) and progression-free survival (p = 0.038) than those with a lower SUVmax. Multivariate analysis showed that WHO tumor grade (p = 0.001) and SUVmax >/= 2.6 (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for tumor-related mortality, but not tumor volume or TBRmax or TBRmean. SUVmax >/= 2.6 (p = 0.007) and being treated for a recurrence rather than for a primary tumor manifestation (p = 0.014) were predictors for progression-free survival, but not TBRmax or TBRmean. CONCLUSION: In this heterogeneous patient population, higher tracer uptake in FET-PET appears to be associated with a worse tumor-related mortality and a shorter duration of the disease-free interval.

Title: Usefulness of FMISO-PET for glioma analysis.
Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common brain tumors in adults. Its diagnosis and management have been determined by histological classifications. It is difficult to establish new paradigms because the pathology has matured and a great deal of knowledge has accumulated. On the other hand, we understand that there are limitations to this gold-standard because of the heterogeneity of glioma. Thus, it is necessary to find new criteria independent of conventional morphological diagnosis. Molecular imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most promising approaches to this challenge. PET provides live information of metabolism through the behavior of single molecules. The advantage of PET is that its noninvasive analysis does not require tissue sample, therefore examination can be performed repeatedly. This is very useful for capturing changes in the biological nature of tumor without biopsy. In the present clinical practice for glioma, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is the most common tracer for predicting prognosis and differentiating other malignant brain tumors. Amino acid tracers such as (11)C-methionine (MET) are the most useful for detecting distribution of glioma, including low-grade. Tracers to image hypoxia are under investigation for potential clinical use, and recently, (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) has been suggested as an effective tracer to distinguish glioblastoma multiforme from others.

Title: High-grade glioma radiation therapy target volumes and patterns of failure obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-FDOPA positron emission tomography delineations from multiple observers.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare recurrent tumor locations after radiation therapy with pretreatment delineations of high-grade gliomas from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) using contours delineated by multiple observers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas underwent computed tomography (CT), gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI, and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT. The image sets (CT, MRI, and PET/CT) were registered, and 5 observers contoured gross tumor volumes (GTVs) using MRI and PET. Consensus contours were obtained by simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). Interobserver variability was quantified by the percentage of volume overlap. Recurrent tumor locations after radiation therapy were contoured by each observer using CT or MRI. Consensus recurrence contours were obtained with STAPLE. RESULTS: The mean interobserver volume overlap for PET GTVs (42% +/- 22%) and MRI GTVs (41% +/- 22%) was not significantly different (P=.67). The mean consensus volume was significantly larger for PET GTVs (58.6 +/- 52.4 cm(3)) than for MRI GTVs (30.8 +/- 26.0 cm(3), P=.003). More than 95% of the consensus recurrence volume was within the 95% isodose surface for 11 of 12 (92%) cases with recurrent tumor imaging. Ten (91%) of these cases extended beyond the PET GTV, and 9 (82%) were contained within a 2-cm margin on the MRI GTV. One recurrence (8%) was located outside the 95% isodose surface. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade glioma contours obtained with (18)F-FDOPA PET had similar interobserver agreement to volumes obtained with MRI. Although PET-based consensus target volumes were larger than MRI-based volumes, treatment planning using PET-based volumes may not have yielded better treatment outcomes, given that all but 1 recurrence extended beyond the PET GTV and most were contained by a 2-cm margin on the MRI GTV.

Title: Role of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET as a diagnostic tool for detection of malignant progression in patients with low-grade glioma.
Abstract: In patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II, early detection of progression to WHO grade III or IV is of high clinical importance because the initiation of a specific treatment depends mainly on the WHO grade. In a significant number of patients with LGG, however, information on tumor activity and malignant progression cannot be obtained on the basis of clinical or conventional MR imaging findings only. We here investigated the potential of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET to noninvasively detect malignant progression in patients with LGG. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (mean age +/- SD, 44 +/- 15 y) with histologically proven LGG (WHO grade II) were investigated longitudinally twice using dynamic (18)F-FET PET and routine MR imaging. Initially, MR imaging and PET scans were performed, and diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of biopsy. Subsequently, PET scans were obtained when clinical findings or contrast-enhanced MR imaging suggested malignant progression. Maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (20-40 min after injection) (TBRmax and TBRmean, respectively) of (18)F-FET uptake as well as tracer uptake kinetics (i.e., time to peak [TTP] and patterns of the time-activity curves) were determined. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging parameters for the detection of malignant progression was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic analyses and by Fisher exact test for 2 x 2 contingency tables. RESULTS: In patients with histologically proven malignant progression toward WHO grade III or IV (n = 18), TBRmax and TBRmean increased significantly, compared with baseline (TBRmax, 3.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.0; TBRmean, 2.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.6; both P < 0.001), whereas TTP decreased significantly (median TTP, 35 vs. 23 min; P < 0.001). Furthermore, time-activity curve patterns changed significantly in 10 of 18 patients (P < 0.001). The combined analysis of (18)F-FET PET parameters (i.e., changes of TBRmax, TTP, or time-activity curve pattern) yielded a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for the detection of malignant progression than changes of contrast enhancement in MR imaging (accuracy, 81% vs. 63%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Both tumor-to-brain ratio and kinetic parameters of (18)F-FET PET uptake provide valuable diagnostic information for the noninvasive detection of malignant progression of LGG. Thus, repeated (18)F-FET PET may be helpful for further treatment decisions.

Title: Grading of cerebral glioma with multiparametric MR imaging and 18F-FDG-PET: concordance and accuracy.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate concordance rates and predictive values in concordant cases among multiparametric MR techniques and FDG-PET to grade cerebral gliomas. METHODS: Multiparametric MR imaging and FDG-PET were performed in 60 consecutive patients with cerebral gliomas (12 low-grade and 48 high-grade gliomas). As the dichotomic variables, conventional MRI, minimum apparent diffusion coefficient in diffusion-weighted imaging, maximum relative cerebral blood volume ratio in perfusion-weighted imaging, choline/creatine ratio and (lipid and lactate)/creatine ratio in MR spectroscopy, and maximum standardised uptake value ratio in FDG-PET in low- and high-grade gliomas were compared. Their concordance rates and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) in concordant cases were obtained for the various combinations of multiparametric MR techniques and FDG-PET. RESULTS: There were significant differences between low- and high-grade gliomas in all techniques. Combinations of two, three, four, and five out of the five techniques showed concordance rates of 77.0 +/- 4.8%, 65.5 +/- 4.0%, 58.3 +/- 2.6% and 53.3%, PPV in high-grade concordant cases of 97.3 +/- 1.7%, 99.1 +/- 1.4%, 100.0 +/- 0% and 100.0% and NPV in low-grade concordant cases of 70.2 +/- 7.5%, 78.0 +/- 6.0%, 80.3 +/- 3.4% and 80.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Multiparametric MR techniques and FDG-PET have a concordant tendency in a two-tiered classification for the grading of cerebral glioma. If at least two examinations concordantly indicated high-grade gliomas, the PPV was about 95%. KEY POINTS: * Modern imaging techniques can help predict the aggressiveness of cerebral gliomas. * Multiparametric MRI and FDG-PET have a concordant tendency to grade cerebral gliomas. * Their high-grade concordant cases revealed at least 95 % positive predictive values. * Their low-grade concordant cases revealed about 70-80% negative predictive values.

Title: 13N-Ammonia PET/CT for detection of recurrent glioma: a prospective comparison with contrast-enhanced MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We assessed the value of N-ammonia PET-computed tomography (PET/CT) in recurrent glioma and compared the results with those of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two (mean age, 39.8+/-11.6 years; male, 33; female, 19) histopathologically proven and previously treated glioma patients with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated with 13N-ammonia PET/CT and CE MRI. PET/CT images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively (maximum standardized uptake value). Tumour to white matter (T/W), tumour to grey matter (T/G) and tumour to pituitary (T/P) ratios were calculated and cutoff levels were derived with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were compared. A combination of clinical follow-up, repeat imaging and biopsy (when available) was taken as the reference standard. RESULTS: On the basis of the reference standard, 23 out of 52 patients were seen to have recurrence. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 13N-ammonia PET/CT were 82.6, 86.2, 82.6, 86.2 and 84.6%, respectively, whereas those of CE MRI were 96.7, 48.3, 59.5, 93.3 and 69.2%, respectively. Overall, 13N-ammonia PET/CT was statistically superior to CE MRI (P=0.001). In low-grade tumours, 13N-ammonia PET/CT performed better than MRI with an accuracy of 86.8 versus 68.4% (P=0.003). In high-grade tumours, both the modalities had comparable performances with accuracies of 78.6% for N-ammonia PET/CT and 71.4% for CE MRI (P=0.250). Among the ratios, T/P was the most useful, with the largest area under the curve (0.825; P=0.0001). CONCLUSION: N-Ammonia PET/CT shows higher accuracy compared with contrast-enhanced MRI for detecting recurrent gliomas, particularly in low-grade tumours.

Title: Comparative evaluation of transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-[(1)(8)F]fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and L-[methyl-(1)(1)C]methionine in human glioma cell lines.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with amino acid tracers is useful for the visualization and assessment of therapeutic effects on gliomas. Our purpose is to elucidate the transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-[(1)(8)F]fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-[(1)(8)F]FACBC) and L-[methyl-(1)(1)C]methionine ([(1)(1)C]Met) in normal human astrocytes (NHA), low-grade (Hs683, SW1088), and high-grade (U87MG, T98G) human glioma cell lines. Because the short half-lives of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 are inconvenient for in vitro experiments, trans-1-amino-3-fluoro[1-(1)(4)C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC) and L-[methyl-(1)(4)C]methionine ([(1)(4)C]Met) were used instead of the PET tracers. Time-course uptake experiments showed that uptake of anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC was 1.4-2.6 times higher than that of [(1)(4)C]Met in NHA and low-grade glioma cells, and was almost equal to that of [(1)(4)C]Met in high-grade glioma cells. To identify the amino acid transporters (AATs) involved in the transport of anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC and [(1)(4)C]Met, we carried out competitive inhibition experiments using synthetic/naturally-occurring amino acids as inhibitors. We found that anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC uptake in the presence of Na(+) was strongly inhibited by L-glutamine and L-serine (the substrates for ASC system AATs), whereas L-phenylalanine and 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, the substrates for L system AATs) robustly inhibited Na(+)-independent anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC uptake. Regardless of Na(+), [(1)(4)C]Met uptake was inhibited strongly by L-phenylalanine and BCH. Moreover, the exchange transport activity of L-glutamine for anti-[(1)(4)C]FACBC was stronger than that of BCH in the presence of Na(+), whereas that for [(1)(4)C]Met was almost equal to BCH. These results demonstrate that ASC and L are important transport systems for anti-[(1)(8)F]FACBC uptake, while system L is predominantly involved in [(1)(1)C]Met transport in human astrocytes and glioma cells.

Title: Analysis of FET-PET imaging for target volume definition in patients with gliomas treated with conformal radiotherapy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques such as stereotactic RT, intensity-modulated RT, or particle irradiation allow local dose escalation with simultaneous sparing of critical organs. Several trials are currently investigating their benefit in glioma reirradiation and boost irradiation. Target volume definition is of critical importance especially when steep dose gradient techniques are employed. In this manuscript we investigate the impact of O-(2-(F-18)fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine-positron emission tomography/computer tomography (FET-PET/CT) on target volume definition in low and high grade glioma patients undergoing either first or re-irradiation with particles. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We investigated volumetric size and uniformity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- vs. FET-PET/CT-derived gross tumor volumes (GTVs) and planning target volumes (PTVs) of 41 glioma patients. Clinical cases are presented to demonstrate potential benefits of integrating FET-PET/CT-planning into daily routine. RESULTS: Integrating FET-uptake into the delineation of GTVs yields larger volumes. Combined modality-derived PTVs are significantly enlarged in high grade glioma patients and in case of primary RT. The congruence of MRI and FET signals for the identification of glioma GTVs is poor with mean uniformity indices of 0.39. MRI-based PTVs miss 17% of FET-PET/CT-based GTVs. Non significant alterations were detected in low grade glioma patients and in those undergoing reirradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Target volume definition for malignant gliomas during initial RT may yield significantly differing results depending upon the imaging modality, which the contouring process is based upon. The integration of both MRI and FET-PET/CT may help to improve GTV coverage by avoiding larger incongruences between physical and biological imaging techniques. In low grade gliomas and in cases of reirradiation, more studies are needed in order to investigate a potential benefit of FET-PET/CT for planning of RT.

Title: Exploratory evaluation of MR permeability with 18F-FDG PET mapping in pediatric brain tumors: a report from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop a method of registering (18)F-FDG PET with MR permeability images for investigating the correlation of (18)F-FDG uptake, permeability, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in children with pediatric brain tumors and their relationship with outcome. METHODS: Twenty-four children with brain tumors in a phase II study of bevacizumab and irinotecan underwent brain MR and (18)F-FDG PET within 2 wk. Tumor types included supratentorial high-grade astrocytoma (n = 7), low-grade glioma (n = 9), brain stem glioma (n = 4), medulloblastoma (n = 2), and ependymoma (n = 2). There were 33 cases (pretreatment only [n = 12], posttreatment only [n = 3], and both pretreatment [n = 9] and posttreatment [n = 9]). (18)F-FDG PET images were registered to MR images from the last time point of the T1 perfusion time series using mutual information. Three-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on permeability images were automatically transferred to registered PET images. The quality of ROI registration was graded (1, excellent; 2, very good; 3, good; 4, fair; and 5, poor) by 3 independent experts. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess correlation of maximum tumor permeability (Kps(max)), maximum CBV (CBV(max)), and maximum (18)F-FDG uptake normalized to white matter (T/W(max)). Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations of these parameters with progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The quality of ROI registration between PET and MR was good to excellent in 31 of 33 cases. There was no correlation of baseline Kps(max) with CBV(max) (Spearman rank correlation = 0.018 [P = 0.94]) or T/W(max) (Spearman rank correlation = 0.07 [P = 0.76]). Baseline CBV(max) was correlated with T/W(max) (Spearman rank correlation = 0.47 [P = 0.036]). Baseline Kps(max), CBV(max), and T/W(max) were not significantly associated with PFS (P = 0.42, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90-1.045, and number of events [n(events)] = 15 for Kps(max); P = 0.41, HR = 0.989, 95% CI = 0.963-1.015, and n(events) = 14 for CBV(max); and P = 0.17, HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.856-2.378, and n(events) = 15 for T/W(max)). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET and MR permeability images were successfully registered and compared across a spectrum of pediatric brain tumors. The lack of correlation between metabolism and permeability may be expected because these parameters characterize different molecular processes. The correlation of CBV and tumor metabolism may be related to an association with tumor grade. More patients are needed for a covariate analysis of these parameters and PFS by tumor histology.

Title: The use of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET for treatment management of bevacizumab and irinotecan in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
Abstract: To date, the use of structural MR imaging (including contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-weighted images) is the standard method to diagnose tumor progression and to assess antiangiogenic treatment effects. However, several studies have suggested that O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET adds valuable clinical information to the information derived from structural MR imaging alone. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the addition of (18)F-FET PET to structural MR imaging for the management of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan (BEV/IR) in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma compared with MR imaging alone from the perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance. METHODS: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the additional use of (18)F-FET PET, a decision tree model was used. Effectiveness of (18)F-FET PET was defined as correct identification of both tumor progression before BEV/IR treatment initiation and BEV/IR treatment response and was evaluated for the combination of (18)F-FET PET and MR imaging compared with MR imaging alone. Costs were estimated for a baseline scenario and for a more expensive scenario. The robustness of the results was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The use of (18)F-FET PET resulted in a number needed to diagnose of 2.4, that is, 3 additional patients have to be diagnosed to avoid 1 wrong diagnosis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (18)F-FET PET/MR imaging compared with MR imaging alone was euro5,725 (euro1  approximately  $1.30) for the baseline scenario and euro8,145 for the more expensive scenario per additional correct diagnosis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: The model suggests that the additional use of (18)F-FET PET in the management of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with BEV/IR may be cost-effective. Integration of (18)F-FET PET has the potential to avoid overtreatment and corresponding costs, as well as unnecessary side effects to the patient.

Title: Differentiation of glioblastomas from metastatic brain tumors by tryptophan uptake and kinetic analysis: a positron emission tomographic study with magnetic resonance imaging comparison.
Abstract: Differentiating high-grade gliomas from solitary brain metastases is often difficult by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); molecular imaging may facilitate such discrimination. We tested the accuracy of alpha[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT)-positron emission tomography (PET) to differentiate newly diagnosed glioblastomas from brain metastases. AMT-PET was performed in 36 adults with suspected brain malignancy. Tumoral AMT accumulation was measured by standardized uptake values (SUVs). Tracer kinetic analysis was also performed to separate tumoral net tryptophan transport (by AMT volume of distribution [VD]) from unidirectional uptake rates using dynamic PET and blood input function. Differentiating the accuracy of these PET variables was evaluated and compared to conventional MRI. For glioblastoma/metastasis differentiation, tumoral AMT SUV showed the highest accuracy (74%) and the tumor/cortex VD ratio had the highest positive predictive value (82%). The combined accuracy of MRI (size of contrast-enhancing lesion) and AMT-PET reached up to 93%. For ring-enhancing lesions, tumor/cortex SUV ratios were higher in glioblastomas than in metastatic tumors and could differentiate these two tumor types with > 90% accuracy. These results demonstrate that evaluation of tryptophan accumulation by PET can enhance pretreatment differentiation of glioblastomas and metastatic brain tumors. This approach may be particularly useful in patients with a newly diagnosed solitary ring-enhancing mass.

Title: Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of [18F]BMS-754807: a potential PET ligand for IGF-1R.
Abstract: Radiosynthesis and in vitro evaluation of [(18)F](S)-1-(4-((5-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)-N-(6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide ([(18)F]BMS-754807 or [(18)F]1) a specific IGF-1R inhibitor was performed. [(18)F]1 demonstrated specific binding in vitro to human cancer tissues. Synthesis of reference standard 1 and corresponding bromo derivative (1a), the precursor for radiolabeling were achieved from 2,4-dichloropyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine (4) in three steps with 50% overall yield. The radioproduct was obtained in 8% yield by reacting 1a with [(18)F]TBAF in DMSO at 170 degrees C at high radiochemical purity and specific activity (1-2Ci/mumol, N=10). The proof of concept of IGF-IR imaging with [(18)F]1 was demonstrated by in vitro autoradiography studies using pathologically identified surgically removed grade IV glioblastoma, breast cancer and pancreatic tumor tissues. These studies indicate that [(18)F]1 can be a potential PET tracer for monitoring IGF-1R.

Title: [Utility of 11C-methionine PET/CT in neuro-oncology].
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-methionine (11C-methionine PET/CT) is a new technique used to evaluate primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. We describe our experience regarding the first 4 patients with glial tumors and 11C-methionine PET/CT. This is a descriptive, observational and prospective study of 4 patients between 38-50 years of age, with different gliomas (WHO classification). MRI and 11C-methionine PET/CT were performed in all cases. Case 1, gliomatosis cerebri grade II post-radiotherapy. Case 2, oligodendroglioma grade II diagnosed and treated with radiotherapy in 1993. Case 3, glioblastoma grade IV post-radiotherapy + temozolomide. Case 4, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grade III post-radiotherapy + temozolomide. The pattern of 11C-methionine uptake compared with MRI showed tumor progression in cases 1, 3 and 4, and in case 2 showed uptake although the final diagnosis was pseudoprogression. Unlike 18fluordeoxiglucose PET/TC, 11C-methionine uptake in normal brain tissue and pseudoprogression is low, and gliomas are displayed as metabolically active areas. The 11C-methionine PET/CT provided valuable information on the tumoral behavior and extension, although in one case presented did not differentiate tumor progression from pseudoprogression. 11C-methionine PET/CT could be a useful tool in the study and follow-up to patients with gliomas.

Title: [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195 tracer kinetics in the brain of glioma patients and a comparison of two referencing approaches.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of neuroinflammation that can be imaged by PET using [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195. We sought to characterize the [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195 kinetics in gliomas of different histotypes and grades, and to compare two reference tissue input functions (supervised cluster analysis versus cerebellar grey matter) for the estimation of [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195 binding in gliomas and surrounding brain structures. METHODS: Twenty-three glioma patients and ten age-matched controls underwent structural MRI and dynamic [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195 PET scans. Tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted from tumour regions as well as grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the brains. Parametric maps of binding potential (BPND) were generated with the simplified reference tissue model using the two input functions, and were compared with each other. TSPO expression was assessed in tumour tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Three types of regional kinetics were observed in individual tumour TACs: GM-like kinetics (n=6, clearance of the tracer similar to that in cerebellar GM), WM-like kinetics (n=8, clearance of the tracer similar to that in cerebral WM) and a form of mixed kinetics (n=9, intermediate rate of clearance). Such kinetic patterns differed between low-grade astrocytomas (WM-like kinetics) and oligodendrogliomas (GM-like and mixed kinetics), but were independent of tumour grade. There was good agreement between parametric maps of BPND derived from the two input functions in all controls and 10 of 23 glioma patients. In 13 of the 23 patients, BPND values derived from the supervised cluster input were systematically smaller than those using the cerebellar input. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that TSPO expression increased with tumour grade. CONCLUSION: The three types of [(1)(1)C]-(R)PK11195 kinetics in gliomas are determined in part by tracer delivery, and indicated that kinetic analysis is a valuable tool in the study of gliomas with the potential for in vivo discrimination between low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Supervised cluster and cerebellar input functions produced consistent BPND estimates in approximately half of the gliomas investigated, but had a systematic difference in the remainder. The cerebellar input is preferred based on theoretical and practical considerations.

Title: The comparison of 13N-ammonia and 18F-FDG in the evaluation of untreated gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive evaluation of glioma is of great help for clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the utility of 13N-ammonia in the evaluation of untreated gliomas and compared the results with that of 18F-FDG. METHODS: Forty-five consecutive patients with final diagnosis of glioma were included in this study. PET/CT imaging was performed for all of them with both 18F-FDG and 13N-ammonia as tracers. Imaging results were analyzed by tumor-to-gray matter (T/G) ratios. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimal T/G cutoff values of each tracer between low-grade and high-grade gliomas. RESULTS: Forty-eight separate lesions were identified in all (grade II, n = 16; grade III, n = 12; and grade IV, n = 20). Twenty-nine out of 32 high-grade lesions (91%) showed higher uptakes than normal gray matter with N-ammonia in comparison with the result of 21 lesions (66%) with 18F-FDG. The optimal T/G cutoff values for 18F-FDG and 13N-ammonia were 0.64 and 0.86 separately with the area under each curve 0.910 and 0.943. The sensitivity and specificity of predicting high-grade gliomas with optimal cutoff values were 83% and 93% for 18F-FDG and 94% and 94% for 13N-ammonia, respectively. CONCLUSION: 13N-Ammonia is superior to 18F-FDG not only in separating low-grade gliomas from high-grade ones but also in the detection of high-grade gliomas for better tumor to normal gray matter contrast.

Title: Comparative diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced MRI and (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT in recurrent glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Ce-MRI) and (18)F-fluorodopa ((18)F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) for detecting recurrent glioma. METHODS: In this prospective study, 35 patients (age, 36.62 +/- 0.86 years; 80 % male) with histopathologically proven glioma with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated using Ce-MRI and (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT. (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT images were evaluated qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Combination of clinical follow-up (minimum 1 year), repeat imaging and/or biopsy (when available) was taken as the reference standard. RESULTS: Based on the reference standard, 26 patients were positive and nine were negative for recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Ce-MRI were 92.3 %, 44.4 % and 80 % respectively, whereas those of (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT were 100 %, 88.89 % and 97.1 % respectively. Results of Ce-MRI and (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT were concordant in 74.3 % (29/35) and discordant in 17.1 % of patients (6/35). On McNemar analysis the difference was not statistically significant overall (P = 0.687), for high-grade tumour (P = 0.5) or low-grade tumours (P = 1.0). However, (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT was more specific than Ce-MRI overall (P = 0.0002), for high-grade tumour (P = 0.006) and low-grade tumours (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: F-FDOPA PET-CT shows a high but comparable diagnostic accuracy to Ce-MRI for the detection of recurrent glioma. However, it is more specific than Ce-MRI. KEY POINTS: * Recurrent glioma in the postoperative site remains a diagnostic dilemma. * (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting recurrent glioma. * Diagnostic accuracies for (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT and contrast enhanced MRI are comparable. * However, (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT is more specific than Ce-MRI for recurrent glioma.

Title: Prospective comparison of (99m)Tc-GH SPECT/CT and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT for detection of recurrent glioma: a pilot study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the role of Tc-GH SPECT/CT and F-FDOPA PET/CT for diagnosing recurrence in patients with glioma. METHODS: Thirty patients with histopathologically proven glioma (glioblastoma multiforme, 14; grade III, 6; grade II, 8; and grade I, 2), who presented with clinical and/or imaging suspicion of recurrence were prospectively evaluated. They were primarily treated with surgery and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Each patient underwent Tc-GH SPECT/CT and F-FDOPA PET/CT within a span of 15 days. Images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by 2 experienced nuclear medicine physicians in consensus. Histopathology and/or clinical/imaging follow-up were used as reference standard. RESULTS: Based on reference standard, 22 patients were positive and 8 were negative for recurrence. Tc-GH SPECT/CT was positive for recurrence in 22 and negative in 8 patients. F-FDOPA PET/CT scan was positive for recurrence in 23 and negative in 7 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 86.4%, 62.5%, and 80% for Tc-GH SPECT/CT and 100%, 87.5%, and 96% for F-FDOPA PET/CT, respectively. No significant difference was found between Tc-GH SPECT/CT and F-FDOPA PET/CT overall (P = 1.00), as well as for low-grade (P = 0.250) or high-grade tumors (P = 0.50). Significant correlation was noted between tumor-brain of Tc-GH with both tumor-striatum (r = 0.371; P = 0.044) and tumor-cerebellum ratio of F-FDOPA (r = 0.369; P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: For detection of recurrence in glioma patients, Tc-GH SPECT/CT is not inferior to F-FDOPA PET/CT and can be used as a low-cost alternative.

Title: Radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of alpha-[F-18]fluoromethyl phenylalanine for brain tumor imaging.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Radiolabeled amino acids have proven utility for imaging brain tumors in humans, particularly those that target system L amino acid transport. We have prepared the novel phenylalanine analogue, (FMePhe, 9), as part of an effort to develop new system L tracers that can be prepared in high radiochemical yield through nucleophilic [(18)F]fluorination. The tumor imaging properties of both enantiomers of this new tracer were evaluated through cell uptake, biodistribution and microPET studies in the mouse DBT model of high grade glioma. METHODS: The non-radioactive form of 9 and the cyclic sulfamidate labeling precursor were prepared from commercially available racemic alpha-benzylserine. Racemic [(18)F]9 was prepared from the labeling precursor in two steps using standard[(18)F]fluoride nucleophilic reaction conditions followed by acidic deprotection. The individual enantiomers [(18)F]9a and [(18)F]9b were isolated using preparative chiral HPLC. In vitro uptake inhibition assays were performed with each enantiomer using DBT cells. Biodistribution and microPET/CT studies were performed with each enantiomer in male BALB/c mice at approximately 2 weeks after implantation of DBT tumor cells. RESULTS: Radiolabeling of the cyclic sulfamidate precursor 5 provides racemic [(18)F]9 in high radiochemical yield (60%-70%, n=4) and high radiochemical purity (>96%, n=4). In vitro uptake assays demonstrate that both [(18)F]9a and [(18)F]9b undergo tumor cell uptake through system L transport. The biodistribution studies using the single enantiomers [(18)F]9a and [(18)F]9b demonstrated good tumor uptake with lower uptake in most normal tissues, and [(18)F]9a had higher tumor uptake than [(18)F]9b. MicroPET imaging demonstrated good tumor visualization within 10 min of injection, rapid uptake of radioactivity, and tumor to brain ratios of approximately 6:1 at 60 min postinjection. CONCLUSIONS: The novel PET tracer, [(18)F]FMePhe, is readily synthesized in good yield from a cyclic sulfamidate precursor. Biodistribution and microPET studies in the DBT model demonstrate good tumor to tissue ratios and tumor visualization, with enantiomer [(18)F]9a having higher tumor uptake. However, the brain availability of both enantiomers was lower than expected for system L substrates, suggesting the [(18)F]fluorine group in the beta-position affects uptake of these compounds by system L transporters.

Title: 18F-FDOPA PET/CT for detection of recurrence in patients with glioma: prospective comparison with 18F-FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Differentiation between recurrence and radiation necrosis in patients with glioma is crucial, since the two entities have completely different management and prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacies of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[(18)F]fluoro-phenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) PET/CT in detection of recurrent gliomas. METHODS: A total of 28 patients (age 38.82 +/- 1.25 years; 85.7% men) with histopathologically proven glioma with clinical/imaging suspicion of recurrence were evaluated using (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT. (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT images were evaluated qualitatively and semiquantitatively. The combination of clinical follow-up, repeat imaging and/or biopsy (when available) was taken as the reference standard. RESULTS: Based on the reference standard, 21 patients were positive and 7 were negative for tumour recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 47.6%, 100% and 60.7%, respectively, and those of (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT were 100%, 85.7% and 96.4%, respectively. The results of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT were concordant in 57.1% of patients (16 of 28) and discordant in 42.9% (12 of 28). The difference in the findings between (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT was significant (P = 0.0005, McNemar's test). The difference was significant for low-grade tumours (P = 0.0039) but not for high-grade tumours (P = 0.250). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT is highly sensitive and specific for detection of recurrence in glioma patients. It is superior to (18)F-FDG PET/CT for this purpose and is especially advantageous in patients with low-grade gliomas.

Title: [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine-positron emission tomography-based therapy monitoring after stereotactic iodine-125 brachytherapy in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: Therapy monitoring of glioma after stereotactic iodine-125 brachytherapy (SBT) remains challenging because posttherapeutic changes in magnetic resonance imaging can mimic tumor progression. We evaluated the prognostic value of serial [18F]fluoroethyltyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomographic (PET) scans for therapy monitoring of high-grade glioma (HGG) after SBT. Thirty-three patients with recurrent HGG were included. Serial FET-PET scans were performed prior to therapeutic intervention and at 3-month intervals during the first year after SBT. FET-PET evaluation was performed by both conventional data analysis and kinetic analysis. Prognostic factors were obtained from proportional hazard models. Median local progression-free survival (LPFS) was 11.1 months. Maximal standardized background uptake value (SUVmax/BG) and biologic tumor volume (BTV) differentiated accurately between therapeutic effects and local tumor progression at the 6-month and subsequent examinations. Increasing uptake kinetics at baseline (p < .05) and during follow-up (p < .01) were stringently associated with a longer LPFS. Early increase in FET uptake after SBT is not unequivocally associated with tumor progression; it might be induced by reactive changes and could easily lead to a misclassification of the tumor status (pseudoprogression). Six months after SBT (or later), however, increased SUVmax/BG and BTV values are associated with a worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis stresses the prognostic importance of dynamic studies.

Title: Biopsy validation of 18F-DOPA PET and biodistribution in gliomas for neurosurgical planning and radiotherapy target delineation: results of a prospective pilot study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delineation of glioma extent for surgical or radiotherapy planning is routinely based on MRI. There is increasing awareness that contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images (T1-CE) may not reflect the entire extent of disease. The amino acid tracer (18)F-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F] fluoro-l-phenylalanine) has a high tumor-to-background signal and high sensitivity for glioma imaging. This study compares (18)F-DOPA PET against conventional MRI for neurosurgical biopsy targeting, resection planning, and radiotherapy target volume delineation. METHODS: Conventional MR and (18)F-DOPA PET/CT images were acquired in 10 patients with suspected malignant brain tumors. One to 3 biopsy locations per patient were chosen in regions of concordant and discordant (18)F-DOPA uptake and MR contrast enhancement. Histopathology was reviewed on 23 biopsies. (18)F-DOPA PET was quantified using standardized uptake values (SUV) and tumor-to-normal hemispheric tissue (T/N) ratios. RESULTS: Pathologic review confirmed glioma in 22 of 23 biopsy specimens. Thirteen of 16 high-grade biopsy specimens were obtained from regions of elevated (18)F-DOPA uptake, while T1-CE was present in only 6 of those 16 samples. Optimal (18)F-DOPA PET thresholds corresponding to high-grade disease based on histopathology were calculated as T/N > 2.0. In every patient, (18)F-DOPA uptake regions with T/N > 2.0 extended beyond T1-CE up to a maximum of 3.5 cm. SUV was found to correlate with grade and cellularity. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-DOPA PET SUV(max) may more accurately identify regions of higher-grade/higher-density disease in patients with astrocytomas and will have utility in guiding stereotactic biopsy selection. Using SUV-based thresholds to define high-grade portions of disease may be valuable in delineating radiotherapy boost volumes.

Title: Clinical value of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography in patients with low-grade glioma.
Abstract: Progress in morphological imaging has facilitated the diagnosis of low-grade glioma (LGG) and plays a decisive role in therapeutic decisions. To date, the method of choice is contrast-enhanced MRI including T1-/T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. However, tumor delineation and the differentiation between neoplastic and normal brain tissue can be difficult when using morphological MRI and may complicate the identification of anaplastic foci for biopsy and further treatment planning. Furthermore, therapy monitoring and the differentiation of tumor recurrence from unspecific post-therapeutic changes in the tissue are challenging. Additional information about tumor metabolism may be very helpful for the diagnostic assessment of LGG and can be provided by PET. In recent years, the PET amino acid tracer O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) has been clinically validated for brain tumor diagnosis. This tracer has logistical advantages over the widely used PET tracer (11)C-methyl-L-methionine due to the longer half-life of the (18)F-label (109 vs 20 minutes, respectively). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that both tracers provide comparable diagnostic information. The authors provide an overview of the recent literature regarding the value of various clinical applications of (18)F-FET PET in patients with LGG.

Title: [18F]-fluoro-ethyl-L-tyrosine PET: a valuable diagnostic tool in neuro-oncology, but not all that glitters is glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of [(18)F]-fluoro-ethyl-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in brain tumors and various non-neoplastic neurologic diseases. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated (18)F-FET PET scans from 393 patients grouped into 6 disease categories according to histology (n = 299) or distinct MRI findings (n = 94) (low-grade/high-grade glial/nonglial brain tumors, inflammatory lesions, and other lesions). (18)F-FET PET was visually assessed as positive or negative. Maximum lesion-to-brain ratios (LBRs) were calculated and compared with MRI contrast enhancement (CE), which was graded visually on a 3-point scale (no/moderate/intense). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of brain tumor were 87% and 68%, respectively. Significant differences in LBRs were detected between high-grade brain tumors (LBR, 2.04 +/- 0.72) and low-grade brain tumors (LBR, 1.52 +/- 0.70; P < .001), as well as among inflammatory (LBR, 1.66 +/- 0.33; P = .056) and other brain lesions (LBR, 1.10 +/- 0.37; P < .001). Gliomas (n = 236) showed (18)F-FET uptake in 80% of World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, 79% of grade II, 92% of grade III, and 100% of grade IV tumors. Low-grade oligodendrogliomas, WHO grade II, had significantly higher (18)F-FET uptakes than astrocytomas grades II and III (P = .018 and P = .015, respectively). (18)F-FET uptake showed a strong association with CE on MRI (P < .001) and was also positive in 52% of 157 nonglial brain tumors and nonneoplastic brain lesions. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FET PET has a high sensitivity for the detection of high-grade brain tumors. Its specificity, however, is limited by passive tracer influx through a disrupted blood-brain barrier and (18)F-FET uptake in nonneoplastic brain lesions. Gliomas show specific tracer uptake in the absence of CE on MRI, which most likely reflects biologically active tumor.

Title: Evaluation of quantitative criteria for glioma grading with static and dynamic 18F-FDopa PET/CT.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare various acquisition and processing protocols for noninvasive glioma grading using either static or dynamic (18)F-FDopa PET. METHODS: Dynamic studies were performed in 33 patients. Based on histopathological analysis, 18 patients had a high-grade (HG) tumor and 15 patients had a low-grade (LG) tumor. For static imaging, SUV(mean) and SUV(max) were calculated for different acquisition time ranges after injection. For dynamic imaging, the transport rate constant k1 was calculated according to a compartmental kinetic analysis using an image-derived input function. RESULTS: With the use of a 5-minute static imaging protocol starting at 38 minutes after injection, newly diagnosed HG tumors could be distinguished from LG tumors with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 90% with a threshold of SUV(mean) of 2.5. In recurrent tumors, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80% for identifying HG tumors were obtained with a threshold set to 1.8. Dynamic imaging only slightly, but nonsignificantly, improved differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Static and dynamic imaging without blood sampling can discriminate between LG and HG for both newly diagnosed and recurrent gliomas. In dynamic imaging, excellent discrimination was obtained by considering the transport rate constant k1 of tumors. In static imaging, the best discrimination based on SUV was obtained for SUV(mean) calculated from a 5-minute acquisition started at 38 minutes after injection.

Title: Fluorine-labeled dasatinib nanoformulations as targeted molecular imaging probes in a PDGFB-driven murine glioblastoma model.
Abstract: Dasatinib, a new-generation Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor, is currently under evaluation in high-grade glioma clinical trials. To achieve optimum physicochemical and/or biologic properties, alternative drug delivery vehicles may be needed. We used a novel fluorinated dasatinib derivative (F-SKI249380), in combination with nanocarrier vehicles and metabolic imaging tools (microPET) to evaluate drug delivery and uptake in a platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB)-driven genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of high-grade glioma. We assessed dasatinib survival benefit on the basis of measured tumor volumes. Using brain tumor cells derived from PDGFB-driven gliomas, dose-dependent uptake and time-dependent inhibitory effects of F-SKI249380 on biologic activity were investigated and compared with the parent drug. PDGFR receptor status and tumor-specific targeting were non-invasively evaluated in vivo using (18)F-SKI249380 and (18)F-SKI249380-containing micellar and liposomal nanoformulations. A statistically significant survival benefit was found using dasatinib (95 mg/kg) versus saline vehicle (P < .001) in tumor volume-matched GEMM pairs. Competitive binding and treatment assays revealed comparable biologic properties for F-SKI249380 and the parent drug. In vivo, Significantly higher tumor uptake was observed for (18)F-SKI249380-containing micelle formulations [4.9 percentage of the injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g); P = .002] compared to control values (1.6%ID/g). Saturation studies using excess cold dasatinib showed marked reduction of tumor uptake values to levels in normal brain (1.5%ID/g), consistent with in vivo binding specificity. Using (18)F-SKI249380-containing micelles as radiotracers to estimate therapeutic dosing requirements, we calculated intratumoral drug concentrations (24-60 nM) that were comparable to in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration values. (18)F-SKI249380 is a PDGFR-selective tracer, which demonstrates improved delivery to PDGFB-driven high-grade gliomas and facilitates treatment planning when coupled with nanoformulations and quantitative PET imaging approaches.

Title: Tryptophan PET in pretreatment delineation of newly-diagnosed gliomas: MRI and histopathologic correlates.
Abstract: Pretreatment delineation of infiltrating glioma volume remains suboptimal with current neuroimaging techniques. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-Gad) MR images often underestimate the true extent of the tumor, while T2-weighted images preferentially highlight peritumoral edema. Accumulation of alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) on positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown in gliomas. To determine whether increased uptake on AMT-PET would detect tumor-infiltrated brain tissue outside the contrast-enhancing region and differentiate it from peritumoral vasogenic edema, volumes and spatial concordance of T1-Gad and T2 MRI abnormalities as well as AMT-PET abnormalities were analyzed in 28 patients with newly-diagnosed WHO grade II-IV gliomas. AMT-accumulating grade I meningiomas were used to define an AMT uptake cutoff threshold that detects the tumor but excludes peri-meningioma vasogenic edema. Tumor infiltration in AMT-accumulating areas was studied in stereotactically-resected specimens from patients with glioblastoma. In the 28 gliomas, mean AMT-PET-defined tumor volumes were greater than the contrast-enhancing volume, but smaller than T2 abnormalities. Volume of AMT-accumulating tissue outside MRI abnormalities increased with higher tumor proliferative index and was the largest in glioblastomas. Tumor infiltration was confirmed by histopathology from AMT-positive regions outside contrast-enhancing glioblastoma mass, while no or minimal tumor cells were found in AMT-negative specimens. These results demonstrate that increased AMT accumulation on PET detects glioma-infiltrated brain tissue extending beyond the contrast-enhanced tumor mass. While tryptophan uptake is low in peritumoral vasogenic edema, AMT-PET can detect tumor-infiltrated brain outside T2-lesions. Thus, AMT-PET may assist pretreatment delineation of tumor infiltration, particularly in high-grade gliomas.

Title: Evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion MRI in the differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To investigate if perfusion measured with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can be used to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with high-grade glioma. METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 19 patients were recruited following surgery and radiation therapy for glioma. Patients had contrast enhancing lesions, which during the standard MRI examination could not be exclusively determined as recurrence or radiation necrosis. DCE-MRI was used to measure cerebral blood volume (CBV), blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Subjects also underwent FDG-PET and lesions were classified as either metabolically active or inactive. Follow-up clinical MRI and lesion histology in case of additional tissue resection was used to determine whether lesions were regressing or progressing. RESULTS: Fourteen enhancing lesions could be classified as progressing (11) or regressing (three). An empirical threshold of 2.0 ml/100 g for CBV allowed detection of regressing lesions with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 100 %. FDG-PET and DCE-MRI agreed in classification of tumor status in 13 out of the 16 cases where an FDG-PET classification was obtained. In two of the remaining three patients, MRI follow-up and histology was available and both indicated that the DCE-MRI answer was correct. CONCLUSION: CBV measurements using DCE-MRI may predict the status of contrast enhancing lesions and give results very similar to FDG-PET with regards to differentiation between tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis.

Title: Diagnostic performance of 18F-FET PET in newly diagnosed cerebral lesions suggestive of glioma.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in the initial diagnosis of cerebral lesions suggestive of glioma. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data of 174 patients (77 women and 97 men; mean age, 45 +/- 15 y) who had been referred for neurosurgical assessment of unclear brain lesions and had undergone (18)F-FET PET. Initial histology (n = 168, confirmed after surgery or biopsy) and the clinical course and follow-up MR imaging in 2 patients revealed 66 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 77 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 2 lymphomas, and 25 nonneoplastic lesions (NNL). In a further 4 patients, initial histology was unspecific, but during the course of the disease all patients developed an HGG. The diagnostic value of maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR(max/)TBR(mean)) of (18)F-FET uptake was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to differentiate between neoplastic lesions and NNL, between HGG and LGG, and between high-grade tumor (HGG or lymphoma) and LGG or NNL. RESULTS: Neoplastic lesions showed significantly higher (18)F-FET uptake than NNL (TBR(max), 3.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.5; P < 0.001). ROC analysis yielded an optimal cutoff of 2.5 for TBR(max) to differentiate between neoplastic lesions and NNLs (sensitivity, 57%; specificity, 92%; accuracy, 62%; area under the curve [AUC], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.84). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 98%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 27%. ROC analysis for differentiation between HGG and LGG (TBR(max), 3.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.0; P < 0.001) yielded an optimal cutoff of 2.5 for TBR(max) (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 65%; accuracy, 72%; AUC, 0.77; PPV, 66%; NPV, 79%; 95% CI, 0.68-0.84). Best differentiation between high-grade tumors (HGG or lymphoma) and both NNL and LGG was achieved with a TBR(max) cutoff of 2.5 (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 72%; accuracy, 75%; AUC, 0.79; PPV, 65%; NPV, 84%; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86). The results for TBR(mean) were similar with a cutoff of 1.9. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FET uptake ratios provide valuable additional information for the differentiation of cerebral lesions and the grading of gliomas. TBR(max) of (18)F-FET uptake beyond the threshold of 2.5 has a high PPV for detection of a neoplastic lesion and supports the necessity of an invasive procedure, for example, biopsy or surgical resection. Low (18)F-FET uptake (TBR(max) < 2.5) excludes a high-grade tumor with high probability.

Title: Meningioangiomatosis in a patient with progressive focal neurological deficit-case report and review of literature.
Abstract: Meningioangiomatosis (MA) represents a vascular hamartoma accompanied by meningothelial cell proliferation. It generally becomes symptomatic with difficult to control seizures, though in some patients it may be asymptomatic. We present the case of a 41-year-old male patient with a newly developed central distal monoparesis of the left leg. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and further diagnostic characterization via (18)F-Fluoro-Ethyl-Tyrosine positron emission tomography ((18)F-FET-PET) indicated a low-grade glioma. Histopathological diagnosis revealed a meningioangiomatosis. The clinical, radiological and neuropathological findings of this rare constellation are described and discussed with the actual literature.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of PET for recurrent glioma diagnosis: a meta-analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies have assessed PET by using various tracers to diagnose disease recurrence in patients with previously treated glioma; however, the accuracy of these methods, particularly compared with alternative imaging modalities, remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the diagnostic accuracy of PET and compare it with alternative imaging modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus (until June 2011), bibliographies, and review articles. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, validity items, and quantitative data on diagnostic accuracy. We performed meta-analysis when >/=5 studies were available. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were eligible. Studies were heterogeneous in treatment strategies and diagnostic criteria of PET; recurrence was typically suspected by CT or MR imaging. The diagnostic accuracies of (18)F-FDG (n = 16) and (11)C-MET PET (n = 7) were heterogeneous across studies. (18)F-FDG PET had a summary sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.85) and specificity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-0.91) for any glioma histology; (11)C-methionine PET had a summary sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.84) and specificity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.44-1.0) for high-grade glioma. These estimates were stable in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Data were limited on (18)F-FET (n = 4), (18)F-FLT (n = 2), and (18)F-boronophenylalanine (n = 1). Few studies performed direct comparisons between different PET tracers or between PET and other imaging modalities. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET appear to have moderately good accuracy as add-on tests for diagnosing recurrent glioma suspected by CT or MR imaging. Studies comparing alternative tracers or PET versus other imaging modalities are scarce. Prospective studies performing head-to-head comparisons between alternative imaging modalities are needed.

Title: Prediction of oligodendroglial histology and LOH 1p/19q using dynamic [(18)F]FET-PET imaging in intracranial WHO grade II and III gliomas.
Abstract: Oligodendroglial components (OC) and loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1p and 19q (LOH 1p/19q) are associated with better outcome in patients with glioma. We aimed to assess the fitness of [(18)F]fluoroethyltyrosine positron-emission-tomography (FET-PET) for noninvasively identifying these important prognostic/predictive factors. One hundred forty-four patients with MRI-suspected WHO grade II and III glioma underwent FET-PET scans prior to histological diagnosis. FET-PET analyses included maximal tumoral uptake (SUV(max)/BG), biological tumor volume (BTV), mean tumoral uptake (SUV(mean)/BG), total tumoral uptake (SUV(total)/BG), and kinetic analysis. Suspicion of OC was based on static and dynamic FET-uptake parameters. PET results were correlated with histology and 1p/19q status. OC tumors exhibited significantly higher uptake values, compared with astrocytomas (AC) (SUV(max)/BG 3.1 vs 2.3, BTV 15.5 mL vs 7.2 mL, SUV(total)/BG 38.5 vs 17.4, P < .01 each; SUV(mean)/BG 2.2 vs 2.1, P < .05). These differences were more pronounced in WHO grade II gliomas. Comparable results were found with respect to 1p/19q status. Kinetic analysis misclassified 18 of 34 low-grade OC tumors as high-grade glioma but misclassified only 5 of 45 of the low-grade ACs. FET-based suspicion of OC resulted in concordance rates of both 76% for the prediction of OC and LOH 1p/19q. FET-uptake was significantly higher in gliomas with OC, compared with AC, and likewise in 1p/19q codeleted, compared with noncodeleted tumors. However, FET-PET analysis did not reliably predict the presence of OC/LOH 1p/19q in the individual patient, mostly because of an overlap in PET characteristics of OC tumors and high-grade AC. Histological examination is still required for an accurate diagnosis.

Title: Correlation of MRI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients in newly diagnosed gliomas with [18F]-fluoro-L-dopa PET: what are we really measuring with minimum ADC?
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is significant interest in whether diffusion-weighted MR imaging indices, such as the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient, may be useful clinically for preoperative tumor grading and treatment planning. To help establish the pathologic correlate of minimum ADC, we undertook a study investigating the relationship between minimum ADC and maximum FDOPA PET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging and FDOPA PET data were acquired preoperatively from 15 patients who were subsequently diagnosed with high-grade brain tumor (WHO grade III or IV) by histopathologic analysis. ADC and SUVR normalized FDOPA PET maps were registered to the corresponding CE MR imaging. Regions of minimum ADC within the FDOPA-defined tumor volume were anatomically correlated with areas of maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake. RESULTS: Minimal anatomic overlap was found between regions exhibiting minimum ADC (a putative marker of tumor cellularity) and maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake (a marker of tumor infiltration and proliferation). FDOPA SUVR measures for tumoral regions exhibiting minimum ADC (1.36+/-0.22) were significantly reduced compared with those with maximum FDOPA uptake (2.45+/-0.88, P=.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a poor correlation between minimum ADC and the most viable/aggressive component of high-grade gliomas. This study suggests that other factors, such as tissue compression and ischemia, may be contributing to restricted diffusion in GBM. Caution should be exercised in the clinical use of minimum ADC as a marker of tumor grade and the use of this index for guiding tumor biopsies preoperatively.

Title: 3'-Deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine PET-derived proliferative volume predicts overall survival in high-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a radiopharmaceutical depicting tumor cell proliferation with PET. In malignancies of the lung, breast, head and neck, digestive tract, brain, and other organs, quantitative assessment of (18)F-FLT targeting has been shown to correlate with the proliferation marker Ki-67 and with clinical outcome measures such as time to progression and overall survival (OS). The aim of this study was to assess various PET segmentation methods to estimate the proliferative volume (PV) and their prognostic value for OS in patients with suspected high-grade glioma. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients underwent preoperative (18)F-FLT PET/CT and T1-weighted MRI of the brain after contrast application. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) of all tumors was calculated, and 3 different segmentation methods for estimating the PV were used: the 50% isocontour of the SUV(max) signal for the PV(50%), the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for an adaptive threshold delineation (PV(SBR)) method, and the iterative background-subtracted relative threshold level (RTL) method to estimate the PV(RTL). The prognostic value of the SUV(max) and the different PVs for OS were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had glioblastoma multiforme, 2 had anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 1 had anaplastic ependymoma, and 1 had anaplastic astrocytoma. The median OS was 397 d (95% confidence interval, 204-577); 19 patients died during the follow-up period. The PV(SBR) showed a significantly (P = 0.002) better association with OS than did SUV(max), PV(RTL), and PV(50%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis resulted in a threshold volume for the PV(SBR) of 11.4 cm(3), with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 83%, respectively, for the prediction of OS. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed a significant discrimination between short and long OS (P = 0.024, log rank) for this threshold. CONCLUSION: The PV as determined by (18)F-FLT PET is associated with OS in high-grade malignant gliomas. The SBR method yielded the best results to predict short and long OS.

Title: 11C-methionine PET for grading and prognostication in gliomas: a comparison study with 18F-FDG PET and contrast enhancement on MRI.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the grading and prognostic value of l-[methyl-(11)C]-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET in glioma patients with (18)F-FDG PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. METHODS: Patients (n = 102) with histopathologically confirmed gliomas were followed up for an average of 34.6 +/- 3.8 mo after PET. The median survival was 18 +/- 4.7 mo in the high-grade glioma group and 58 +/- 27 mo in the low-grade glioma group. Patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET, (11)C-MET PET, and MRI in the diagnostic and preoperative stage. The ratio of the mean standardized uptake value in the tumor to mean standardized uptake value in contralateral normal cortex (T/N ratio) was calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and ANOVA were performed. RESULTS: T/N ratios for (11)C-MET PET and (18)F-FDG PET were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (2.15 +/- 0.77 vs. 1.56 +/- 0.74, P < 0.001, and 0.85 +/- 0.61 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.37, P < 0.01, respectively). Median survival was 19 +/- 5.4 mo in patients with a T/N ratio greater than 1.51 for (11)C-MET PET and 58 +/- 26.7 mo in those with a T/N ratio less than 1.51 (P = 0.03). Among the LGGs, median survival was lower in patients with a mean T/N ratio greater than 1.51 for (11)C-MET PET (16 +/- 10 mo; 95% confidence interval, 1-36 mo) than in those with a T/N ratio less than 1.51 (P = 0.04). No significant difference in survival in LGGs was based on (18)F-FDG uptake and MRI contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION: (11)C-MET PET can predict prognosis in gliomas and is better than (18)F-FDG PET and MRI in predicting survival in LGGs.

Title: Re-irradiation in recurrent malignant glioma: prognostic value of [18F]FET-PET.
Abstract: The aim of the present study is to determine new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging-related factors predictive of progression-free survival as well as survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) prior to and after re-irradiation. Fifty-six patients with recurrent MG who underwent re-irradiation treatment and pretherapeutic dynamic [(18)F]-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET scan were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic value of different parameters, such as biological tumor volume, maximal tumor uptake (SUV(max)/BG), mean tumor uptake (SUV(mean)/BG), as well as uptake kinetics, was evaluated. [(18)F]FET uptake kinetics was classified according to a five-point rating as category G(1-2) (strongly/mainly increasing kinetics), G(3) (mixed 1:1), or G(4-5) (mainly/strongly decreasing kinetics). Patients within the pretherapeutic kinetic group G(4-5) had significantly worse survival than the other two groups (p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that histologic grade, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and kinetic group were independent significant predictors for survival after re-irradiation. The uptake kinetics of [(18)F]FET-PET is an independent determinant of overall and to a lesser extent also progression-free survival. Thus, [(18)F]FET-PET kinetics may provide valuable additional prognostic information for treatment decisions.

Title: Response assessment of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent malignant glioma using [18F]Fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine PET in comparison to MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate prospectively the potential of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET in comparison to MRI for the assessment of the response of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) to antiangiogenic treatment. METHODS: Ten patients with rHGG were treated biweekly with bevacizumab/irinotecan (BEV/IR). MR images and dynamic (18)F-FET PET scans were obtained at baseline and at follow-up after the start of treatment (median 4.9 weeks). Using MRI treatment response was evaluated according to RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) criteria. For (18)F-FET PET evaluation, a reduction >45 % of the metabolically active tumour volume was considered as a treatment response, with the metabolically active tumour being defined as a tumour-to-brain ratio (TBR) of >/=1.6. The results of the treatment assessments were related to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). For further evaluation of PET data, maximum and mean TBR were calculated using region-of-interest analysis at baseline and at follow-up. Additionally, (18)F-FET uptake kinetic studies were performed at baseline and at follow-up in all patients. Time-activity curves were generated and the times to peak (TTP) uptake (in minutes from the beginning of the dynamic acquisition to the maximum uptake) were calculated. RESULTS: At follow-up, MRI showed a complete response according to RANO criteria in one of the ten patients (10 %), a partial response in five patients (50 %), and stable disease in four patients (40 %). Thus, MRI did not detect tumour progression. In contrast, (18)F-FET PET revealed six metabolic responders (60 %) and four nonresponders (40 %). In the univariate survival analyses, a response detected by (18)F-FET PET predicted a significantly longer PFS (median PFS, 9 vs. 3 months; P = 0.001) and OS (median OS 23.0 months vs. 3.5 months; P = 0.001). Furthermore, in four patients (40 %), diagnosis according to RANO criteria and by (18)F-FET PET was discordant. In these patients, PET was able to detect tumour progression earlier than MRI (median time benefit 10.5 weeks; range 6-12 weeks). At baseline and at follow-up, in nonresponders TTP was significantly shorter than in responders (baseline TTP 10 +/- 8 min vs. 35 +/- 9 min; P = 0.002; follow-up TTP 23 +/- 9 min vs. 39 +/- 8 min; P = 0.02). Additionally, at baseline a kinetic pattern characterized by an early peak of (18)F-FET uptake followed by a constant descent was more frequently observed in the nonresponders (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Both standard and kinetic imaging parameters derived from(18)F-FET PET seem to predict BEV/IR treatment failure and thus contribute important additional information for clinical management over and above the information obtained by MRI response assessment based on RANO criteria.

Title: [Diagnostic imaging of high-grade astrocytoma: heterogeneity of clinical manifestation, image characteristics, and histopathological findings].
Abstract: Recent developments in diagnostic radiology, which have enabled accurate differential diagnoses of brain tumors, have been well described in the last three decades. MR and PET imaging can also provide information to predict histological grades and prognoses that might influence treatment strategies. However, high-grade astrocytomas consist of many different subtypes that are associated with different imaging and histological characteristics. Hemorrhage and necrosis results in a variety of imaging features, and infiltrative tumor growth entrapping normal neurons may cause different clinical manifestations. We reviewed patients with high-grade astrocytomas that showed various imaging characteristics, with special emphasis on initial symptoms and histological features. Clinicopathological characteristics of astrocytomas were also compared with other malignant tumors. Neurological deficits were not notable in patients with grade 3-4 astrocytomas when they showed infiltrative tumor growth, while brain metastases with compact cellular proliferation caused more neurological symptoms. Infiltrative tumors did not show any enhancing masses on MR imaging, but these tumors may show intratumor heterogeneity. Seizures were reported to be more frequent in low-grade glioma and in secondary glioblastoma. Tumor heterogeneity was also reported in molecular genetic profile, and investigators identified some subsets of astrocytomas. They investigated IHD1/2 mutation, EGFR amplification, TP53 mutation, Ki-67 index, etc. In summary, high-grade astrocytomas are not homogenous groups of tumors, and this is associated with the heterogeneity of clinical manifestation, image characteristics, and histopathological findings. Molecular studies may explain the tumor heterogeneity in the near future.

Title: [Treatment for volume upgrading of the low-grade supratentorial glioma after the subtotal neurosurgical resection].
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas WHO II (LGG) are mostly detected in patients with neurological symptomatology between 20 and 45 years of age very often as secondary epilepsy. We present two cases in which low-grade gliomas attacked neurological zones. Neurosurgical resection was subtotal because of the risk of the damage in neurocognitive functions in both these patients. After the operation, both patients were followed at neurosurgery department in regular intervals using different imaging methods (MRI, MRS and PET). After resections, the MRI detected the enlargement of the volumes of the tumor residua in both patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Owing to the risk of up-grading to high-grades glial tumors (overexpression of EGFR and VEGF), both patients were indicated for curative treatment by external beam radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (Temodal(R)) and adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: After the end of this treatment, the MRI proved considerable partial regressions in both patients. Moreover, three months later, the MRI did not prove any residual disease. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy combined with the administration of Temodal should prolong the OS and TTP in patients with a high risk of up-grading of low-grade gliomas of the brain. Both the patients are in a follow-up program, also because of the risk of duplicite brain tumor.

Title: [Operative neurosurgery: Personal view and historical backgrounds. (10) Microneurosurgery and PET scan: clinical experience of a neurosurgeon].
Abstract: During the author's clinical activity at three institutes : Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto 1965-1969, 1977-1985), National Cardiovascular Center NCVC (Osaka 1986-1992) and Zurich University Hospital (Zurich 1970-1976, 1993-2007), He has experienced (underlined periods) working with PET scan and SPECT in relation to microsurgical treatment. The following describes how and for what the author has been engaged in this regard. 1. As preparation for the work with PET, SPECT with a rotating gamma camera was used to know blood distribution with the use of Kr-81m infusion from a selectively located catheter in the ICA, ECA or VA, e.g. to know the flow distribution of a newly constructed EC-IC bypass, which was quite separated from and not mixed up with that of already functioning inherent collaterals (Fig. 1). 2. With the use of inhalation PET scan (15O labelled CO2 and O2 inhalation and 15O CO inhalation) basic knowledge of hemodynamics of MMD was acquired (Fig. 2) 3. With the use of H215 O-PET scan with DiamoxR loading, indication for and effectiveness of EC-IC bypass surgery for occlusive cerebrovascular disease (atherosclerosis (anterior circulation (Fig. 5), posterior circulation (Fig. 6, 7)), MMD (Fig. 9), congenital disease (Fig. 8) have been settled or demonstrated. 4. In epileptic seizures, interictally or intraictally, the active locus has been identified by the use of FDG-PET, flumazenil-PET, H 2 15 O or 13 NH 3-PET respectively (Fig. 12). In this relation, selective Wada test with the use of Tc-99 m-ECD selective infusion together with Amytal R through a catheter inserted selectively into the anterior choroidal artery is an important preoperative test for the SAHE (Fig. 13). 5. FDG-PET and/or tyrosine PET supply important clues concerning appropriate surgical treatment strategy, and also for intractable glioblastoma or high grade glioma, so that in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy one may expect more excellent long term outcome with good quality of life (Fig. 16, 17). Furthermore, there must be cases with dementia in which some revascularization procedure might be of help, for which FDG-and H 2 15O-PET could be helpful for differential diagnosis and indication of surgery (Fig. 18).

Title: Comparison of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-fluorothymidine PET in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The objective was to compare F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Visual and quantitative analyses were derived from static FDG PET and static and dynamic FLT PET in 15 patients with suspected recurrence of treated grade 2 glioma or worse with a new focus of Gd contrast enhancement on MRI. For FDG PET, SUVmax and the ratio of lesion SUVmax to the SUVmean of contralateral white matter were measured. For FLT PET, SUVmax and Patlak-derived metabolic flux parameter Kimax were measured for the same locus. A 5-point visual confidence scale was applied to FDG PET and FLT PET. Receiver operating curve analysis was applied to visual and quantitative results. Differences between recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis were tested by Kruskal-Wallis analysis. On the basis of follow-up Gd-enhanced MRI, lesion-specific recurrent tumor was defined as a definitive increase in size of the lesion, and radiation necrosis was defined as stability or regression. RESULTS: For FDG SUVmax, the FDG ratio of lesion-white matter, and FLT Kimax, there was a significant difference between mean values for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis. Recurrent tumor was best identified by the FDG ratio of lesion-contralateral normal white matter (area under the curve of 0.98, confidence interval of 0.91 to 1.00, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 75% for an optimized cutoff value of 1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Both quantitative and visual determinations allow accurate differentiation between recurrent glioma and radiation necrosis by both FDG and FLT PET. In this small series, FLT PET offers no advantage over FDG PET.

Title: Quantitative PET imaging of tryptophan accumulation in gliomas and remote cortex: correlation with tumor proliferative activity.
Abstract: PURPOSE: PET studies with alpha[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) have shown decreased serotonin synthesis based on a decrease of the unidirectional uptake rate (K-complex) in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and depression. Increased AMT K-complex in tumors can indicate increased tryptophan metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway. Moreover, apparent AMT volume of distribution (VD') reflects net tryptophan transport from blood to tissue. We evaluated if kinetic parameters (K-complex, VD') of AMT, measured by PET, can predict the proliferative activity of glioma, and if these AMT parameters are altered in the remote cortex. METHODS: We evaluated dynamic AMT PET images of 30 adult patients with grade 2 to 4 gliomas according to the World Health Organization's classification to determine tumoral AMT VD' and K-complex values, which were correlated with tumor proliferative activity as assessed by the Ki-67 labeling index in resected tumor specimens. We also compared cortical VD' and K-complex values between patients with glioma and healthy controls. RESULTS: Both VD' and K-complex values were significantly higher in gliomas than in the contralateral cortex (VD', P < 0.001; K-complex, P < 0.001). Tumoral VD' values and tumor/cortex VD' ratios, but not the K-complex, showed strong positive correlations with the proliferative activity of glioma (P </= 0.001). The contralateral frontal cortex showed decreased AMT VD' and K-complex in patients with glioma compared with those in controls (P </= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased net amino acid transport into tumor tissue, quantified by PET, can serve as an imaging marker of the proliferative activity of glioma. The data also suggest a glioma-induced down-regulation of cortical serotonin synthesis, likely mediated by shunting of tryptophan from serotonin synthesis to kynurenine metabolism.

Title: Application of 62Cu-diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) PET imaging to predict highly malignant tumor grades and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in patients with glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxic tissue evaluation in glioma is important for predicting treatment response and establishing antihypoxia therapy. In this preliminary study, (62)Cu-ATSM PET was used to determine its validity as a biomarker for distinguishing tumor grade and tissue hypoxia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (62)Cu-ATSM PET was performed in 22 patients with glioma, and the (62)Cu-ATSM SUV(max) and T/B ratio were semiquantitatively evaluated. (62)Cu-ATSM uptake distribution was qualitatively evaluated and compared with MR imaging findings. HIF-1alpha expression, a hypoxia marker, was compared with (62)Cu-ATSM uptake values. RESULTS: The (62)Cu-ATSM SUV(max) and T/B ratio were significantly higher in grade IV than in grade III gliomas (P = .014 and .018, respectively), whereas no significant differences were found between grade III and grade II gliomas. At a T/B ratio cutoff threshold of 1.8, (62)Cu-ATSM uptake was predictive of HIF-1alpha expression, with 92.3% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The mean T/B ratio was also significantly higher in HIF-1alpha-positive glioma tissue than in HIF-1alpha-negative tissue (P = .001). Using this optimal threshold of T/B ratio, (62)Cu-ATSM PET showed regional uptake in 61.9% (13/21) of tumors within the contrast-enhanced region on MR imaging, which was significantly correlated with presence of a necrotic component (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that (62)Cu-ATSM uptake is relatively high in grade IV gliomas and correlates with the MR imaging findings of necrosis. Moreover, the (62)Cu-ATSM T/B ratio showed significant correlation with HIF-1alpha expression. Thus, (62)Cu-ATSM appears to be a suitable biomarker for predicting highly malignant grades and tissue hypoxia in patients with glioma.

Title: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) mimicking high-grade glioma on delayed F-18 FDG PET imaging.
Abstract: The purpose of our study was to determine the increase in F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a patient with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) between early and late scan times using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 FDG at conventional (60 minutes [min] after injection, PET(60)) and delayed (300 min after injection, PET(300)) intervals. PET(60) and PET(300) imaging was performed on a pathologically proven PML lesion. The PML lesion in the posterior fossa exhibited an increase in F-18 FDG uptake of 52% between early and late times, which was in the range of that in high-grade gliomas. Thus, dual-time-point PET with F-18 FDG may not be able to differentiate between infectious and malignant brain lesions.

Title: Accurate differentiation of recurrent gliomas from radiation injury by kinetic analysis of alpha-11C-methyl-L-tryptophan PET.
Abstract: PET of amino acid transport and metabolism may be more accurate than conventional neuroimaging in differentiating recurrent gliomas from radiation-induced tissue changes. alpha-(11)C-methyl-l-tryptophan ((11)C-AMT) is an amino acid PET tracer that is not incorporated into proteins but accumulates in gliomas, mainly because of tumoral transport and metabolism via the immunomodulatory kynurenine pathway. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of (11)C-AMT PET supplemented by tracer kinetic analysis for distinguishing recurrent gliomas from radiation injury. METHODS: Twenty-two (11)C-AMT PET scans were obtained in adult patients who presented with a lesion suggestive of tumor recurrence on conventional MRI 1-6 y (mean, 3 y) after resection and postsurgical radiation of a World Health Organization grade II-IV glioma. Lesional standardized uptake values were calculated, as well as lesion-to-contralateral cortex ratios and 2 kinetic (11)C-AMT PET parameters (volume of distribution [VD], characterizing tracer transport, and unidirectional uptake rate [K]). Tumor was differentiated from radiation-injured tissue by histopathology (n = 13) or 1-y clinical and MRI follow-up (n = 9). Accuracy of tumor detection by PET variables was assessed by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. RESULTS: All (11)C-AMT PET parameters were higher in tumors (n = 12) than in radiation injury (n = 10) (P </= 0.012 in all comparisons). The lesion-to-cortex K-ratio most accurately identified tumor recurrence, with highly significant differences both in the whole group (P < 0.0001) and in lesions with histologic verification (P = 0.006); the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.99. A lesion-to-cortex K-ratio threshold of 1.39 (i.e., a 39% increase) correctly differentiated tumors from radiation injury in all but 1 case (100% sensitivity and 91% specificity). In tumors that were high-grade initially (n = 15), a higher lesion-to-cortex K-ratio threshold completely separated recurrent tumors (all K-ratios >/= 1.70) from radiation injury (all K-ratios < 1.50) (100% sensitivity and specificity). CONCLUSION: Kinetic analysis of dynamic (11)C-AMT PET images may accurately differentiate between recurrent World Health Organization grade II-IV infiltrating gliomas and radiation injury. Separation of unidirectional uptake rates from transport can enhance the differentiating accuracy of (11)C-AMT PET. Applying the same approach to other amino acid PET tracers might also improve their ability to differentiate recurrent gliomas from radiation injury.

Title: Usefulness of FDG, MET and FLT-PET studies for the management of human gliomas.
Abstract: The use of positron imaging agents such as FDG, MET, and FLT is expected to lead the way for novel applications toward efficient malignancy grading and treatment of gliomas. In this study, the usefulness of FDG, MET and FLT-PET images was retrospectively reviewed by comparing their histopathological findings. FDG, MET, and FLT-PET were performed in 27 patients with WHO grade IV, 15 patients with WHO grade III, and 12 patients with WHO grade II during 5.5 years. The resulting PET images were compared by measuring SUVs and T/N ratios (tumor to normal tissue ratios). Although there were no significant differences in FDG-PET, there were significant differences in the T/N ratios in the MET-PET between WHO grades II and IV and in the FLT-PET between the WHO grades III and IV. In glioblastoma patients, the SUVs of the areas depicted by MRI in the MET-PET were different from those SUVs in the FLT-PET. Importantly, the areas with high SUVs in both MET-PET and FLT-PET were also high in Ki-67 index and were histologically highly malignant. PET imaging is a noninvasive modality that is useful in determining a tumor area for removal as well as improving preoperative diagnosis for gliomas.

Title: MRI-suspected low-grade glioma: is there a need to perform dynamic FET PET?
Abstract: PURPOSE: Since differentiation between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) remains challenging according to MRI criteria alone, we investigated the discriminative value of additional dynamic FET PET in patients with MRI-suspected LGG. METHODS: Included in this retrospective study were 127 patients with newly diagnosed MRI-suspected LGG and dynamic FET PET prior to histopathological assessment. FET PET lesions were visually classified as having reduced, normal, or increased tracer uptake. Maximal tumour uptake scaled to the mean background uptake (SUV(max)/BG), mean tumour uptake (SUV(mean)/BG), biological tumour volume and kinetics were evaluated and correlated with individual histopathological findings. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis revealed 71 patients with LGG, 47 patients with HGG (including 5 glioblastoma multiforme), 2 patients with low-grade ganglioglioma and 7 patients with non-neoplastic lesions. Of the 127 patients, 97 had lesions with increased FET uptake, of which 93 were neoplastic. Increased uptake was found in 49/71 LGG (69 %) and 42/47 HGG (89 %). None of the conventional uptake parameters differed significantly between the HGG and LGG groups. Kinetic analysis reliably identified HGG (sensitivity 95 %, specificity 72 %, PPV 74 %, NPV 95 %). Normal tracer uptake was observed in 19 patients (15 with LGG, 1 with HGG and 3 with non-neoplastic lesions) and reduced uptake in 11 patients (7 with LGG and 4 with HGG). CONCLUSION: Among the MRI-suspected LGG, kinetic but not conventional analysis of FET uptake enabled remarkably high sensitivity for detection of HGG. This held true even for lesions with low or diffuse tracer uptake. Lesions with reduced tracer uptake must be interpreted with caution, as they can also harbour HGG tissue.

Title: Comparison of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine PET and O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET in patients with newly diagnosed glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to clarify the value of FLT PET and FET PET for the noninvasive grading and prognosis of newly diagnosed gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were investigated with FLT and FET PET before surgery. FLT and FET uptakes were assessed by the maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) of tumor, and the ratio to uptake in the normal brain parenchyma (TNR). All tumors were graded by WHO system. RESULTS: FLT PET detected all 17 high-grade gliomas (HGG) and did not detect all 3 low-grade gliomas (LGG). FET PET detected all 20 HGG and LGG regardless of grading. The average FLT SUVmax in HGG and LGG was 1.51 +/- 0.72 and 0.30 +/- 0.07, and the average FLT TNR in HGG and LGG was 5.52 +/- 3.09 and 1.12 +/- 0.14, respectively. The differences of FLT SUVmax and TNR between HGG and LGG were statistically significant (p=0.0069, p=0.0070). The average FET SUVmax in HGG and LGG was 2.68 +/- 0.86 and 1.36 +/- 0.15, and the average FET TNR in HGG and LGG was 2.31 +/- 0.73 and 1.27 +/- 0.12, respectively. The differences of FET SUVmax and TNR between HGG and LGG were statistically significant (p=0.0129, p=0.0095). CONCLUSIONS: FET PET has higher sensitivity in detection of gliomas rather than FLT PET, but it seems that FLT PET is better than FET PET for noninvasive grading and predicting prognosis of newly diagnosed gliomas, considering high contrast of FLT and overlap of FET uptakes between HGG and LGG.

Title: An observational study of the first experience with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma in two belgian university hospitals.
Abstract: Background. Bevacizumab (BEV), a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF has demonstrated activity against recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGG) in phase II clinical trials. Patients and Methods. Data were collected from patients with recurrent HGG who initiated treatment with BEV outside a clinical trial protocol at two Belgian university hospitals. Results. 19 patients (11 M/8 F) were administered a total of 138 cycles of BEV (median 4, range 1-31). Tumor response assessment by MRI was available for 15 patients; 2 complete responses and 3 partial responses for an objective response rate of 26% for the intent to treat population were observed on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images; significant regressions on T2/FLAIR were documented in 10 out of 15 patients (67%). A reduced uptake on PET was documented in 3 out of 4 evaluable patients. The six-month progression-free survival was 21% (95% CI 2.7-39.5). Two patients had an ongoing tumor response and remained free from progression after 12 months of BEV treatment. Conclusions. The activity and tolerability of BEV were comparable to results from previous prospective phase II trials. Reduced uptake on PET suggests a metabolic response in addition to an antiangiogenic effect in some cases with favorable clinical outcome.

Title: Hypoxia assessed by 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography in newly diagnosed gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of hypoxia in newly diagnosed gliomas using 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET and to compare the results with tumor grade. METHODS: A total of 30 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were examined using FMISO PET. Grading of the tumor was performed according to the WHO classification. The FMISO PET images were scaled to the venous blood concentration of FMISO activity to produce tumor-to-blood (T/B) values. Hypoxia was defined as a region with a T/B ratio of at least 1.2, and the maximum T/B (T/Bmax) value was calculated by region-of-interest analysis. RESULTS: There was a correlation between FMISO uptake and glioma grade, with all low-grade gliomas (grades I and II) demonstrating no hypoxia and all high-grade gliomas (grades III and IV) showing hypoxia. The mean T/Bmax in grade IV gliomas was significantly higher than that in grade III gliomas (P<0.02). CONCLUSION: FMISO PET is a potential tracer in the assessment of noninvasive tumor grading in newly diagnosed gliomas.

Title: FDG-PET predicts survival in recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.
Abstract: Prognosis of recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, although bevacizumab has been documented in that context. This study aimed to determine the independent prognostic value of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of recurrent HGG after combined treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan, compared with other documented prognostic variables. Twenty-five adult patients with histologically proven HGG were included at recurrence. Brain FDG-PET imaging was performed within 6 weeks of starting chemotherapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Response based on MRI was assessed every 2 months according to revised assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Median PFS and OS were 4 months (range, 0.9-10.4 months) and 7.2 months (range, 1.2-41.7 months), respectively. At 6 months, PFS and OS rate were 16.0% and 72.0%. FDG uptake was the most powerful predictor of both PFS and OS, using either univariate or multivariate analysis, among all variables tested: histological grade, Karnofsky performance status, steroid intake, and number of previous treatments. Moreover, FDG uptake was also prognostic of response to bevacizumab-based therapy. This study provides the first evidence that pretreatment FDG-PET can serve as an imaging biomarker in recurrent HGG for predicting survival following anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab.

Title: (1)(1)C-methionine and (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT in the evaluation of patients with suspected primary and residual/recurrent gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer in tumor imaging, but its use for brain gliomas and recurrence is limited by the high (18)F-FDG uptake in normal brain tissue. (11)C-methionine (MET) has low uptake in the normal brain tissue, providing potential advantages over (18)F-FDG. The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of (11)C-MET compared to (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with suspected primary and residual/recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Eighty paired PET/CT scans using (11)C-MET and (18)F-FDG were performed on 44 newly diagnosed patients with suspected gliomas and 36 post-operative patients with suspected residual/recurrent tumors. PET/CT results were evaluated by visual and semiquantitative analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of gliomas and residual/recurrent tumors were calculated using visual analysis. Tumor to contralateral normal gray matter (T/G) ratio was calculated for semiquantitative analysis. RESULTS: Final pathology of the 44 newly diagnosed patients included 26 gliomas (14 high-grade and 12 low-grade tumors) and 18 non-glioma benign lesions. Residual/recurrent gliomas were verified in 28 patients and excluded in 8/36 post-operative patients by subsequent histopathologic examination and/or clinical follow-up for more than six months. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (11)C-MET PET/CT were 88.5%, 83.3% and 86.4% for gliomas and 96.4%, 87.5% and 94.4% for residual/recurrent gliomas, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 50.0%, 88.9% and 65.9% for gliomas and 46.4%, 100.0% and 58.3% for residual/recurrent gliomas, respectively. (11)C-MET had a higher sensitivity than (18)F-FDG (83.3% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.031) in low-grade gliomas, but had no significant difference in sensitivity from (18)F-FDG for high-grade gliomas (92.9% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.219). (11)C-MET T/G uptake ratios in high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas and benign lesions were 1.94 +/- 0.53, 1.78 +/- 0.61 and 1.06 +/- 0.34, respectively. (18)F-FDG T/G uptake ratios in high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas and benign lesions were 1.05 +/- 0.37, 0.66 +/- 0.14 and 0.63 +/- 0.17, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: (11)C-MET PET/CT is superior to (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detecting and delineating gliomas and residual/recurrent tumors, especially low-grade gliomas and residual/recurrent lesions present in gray matter, but its role in non-invasive grading of the tumors is limited.

Title: (1)(8)F-Fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography may differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from less malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor and its prognosis is significantly poorer than those of less malignant gliomas. Pathologically, necrosis is one of the most important characteristics that differentiate GBM from lower grade gliomas; therefore, we hypothesized that (18)F fluoromisonidazole (FMISO), a radiotracer for hypoxia imaging, accumulates in GBM but not in lower grade gliomas. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of FMISO positron emission tomography (PET) for the differential diagnosis of GBM from lower grade gliomas. METHODS: This prospective study included 23 patients with pathologically confirmed gliomas. All of the patients underwent FMISO PET and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET within a week. FMISO images were acquired 4 h after intravenous administration of 400 MBq of FMISO. Tracer uptake in the tumor was visually assessed. Lesion to normal tissue ratios and FMISO uptake volume were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 23 glioma patients, 14 were diagnosed as having GBM (grade IV glioma in the 2007 WHO classification), and the others were diagnosed as having non-GBM (5 grade III and 4 grade II). In visual assessment, all GBM patients showed FMISO uptake in the tumor greater than that in the surrounding brain tissues, whereas all the non-GBM patients showed FMISO uptake in the tumor equal to that in the surrounding brain tissues (p </= 0.001). One GBM patient was excluded from FDG PET study because of hyperglycemia. All GBM patients and three of the nine (33%) non-GBM patients showed FDG uptake greater than or equal to that in the gray matter. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing GBM were 100 and 100% for FMISO, and 100 and 66% for FDG, respectively. The lesion to cerebellum ratio of FMISO uptake was higher in GBM patients (2.74 +/- 0.60, range 1.71-3.81) than in non-GBM patients (1.22 +/- 0.06, range 1.09-1.29, p </= 0.001) with no overlap between the groups. The lesion to gray matter ratio of FDG was also higher in GBM patients (1.46 +/- 0.75, range 0.91-3.79) than in non-GBM patients (1.07 +/- 0.62, range 0.66-2.95, p </= 0.05); however, overlap of the ranges did not allow clear differentiation between GBM and non-GBM. The uptake volume of FMISO was larger in GBM (27.18 +/- 10.46%, range 14.02-46.67%) than in non-GBM (6.07 +/- 2.50%, range 2.12-9.22%, p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that FMISO PET may distinguish GBM from lower grade gliomas.

Title: Quantitative volumetric analysis of gliomas with sequential MRI and (1)(1)C-methionine PET assessment: patterns of integration in therapy planning.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the volumetric integration patterns of standard MRI and (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) images in the surgery planning of gliomas and their relationship to the histological grade. METHODS: We studied 23 patients with suspected or previously treated glioma who underwent preoperative (11)C-methionine PET because MRI was imprecise in defining the surgical target contour. Images were transferred to the treatment planning system, coregistered and fused (BrainLAB). Tumour delineation was performed by (11)C-methionine PET thresholding (vPET) and manual segmentation over MRI (vMRI). A 3-D volumetric study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of each modality to tumour target volume. All cases were surgically treated and histological classification was performed according to WHO grades. Additionally, several biopsy samples were taken according to the results derived either from PET or from MRI and analysed separately. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had high-grade tumours [ten glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and five anaplastic), whereas eight patients had low-grade tumours. Biopsies from areas with high (11)C-methionine uptake without correspondence in MRI showed tumour proliferation, including infiltrative zones, distinguishing them from dysplasia and radionecrosis. Two main PET/MRI integration patterns emerged after analysis of volumetric data: pattern vMRI-in-vPET (11/23) and pattern vPET-in-vMRI (9/23). Besides, a possible third pattern with differences in both directions (vMRI-diff-vPET) could also be observed (3/23). There was a statistically significant association between the tumour classification and integration patterns described above (p < 0.001, kappa = 0.72). GBM was associated with pattern vMRI-in-vPET (9/10), low-grade with pattern vPET-in-vMRI (7/8) and anaplastic with pattern vMRI-diff-vPET (3/5). CONCLUSION: The metabolically active tumour volume observed in (11)C-methionine PET differs from the volume of MRI by showing areas of infiltrative tumour and distinguishing from non-tumour lesions. Differences in (11)C-methionine PET/MRI integration patterns can be assigned to tumour grades according to the WHO classification. This finding may improve tumour delineation and therapy planning for gliomas.

Title: Comparison of F-18 FDG and C-11 methionine PET/CT for the evaluation of recurrent primary brain tumors.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF STUDY: With the availability of multiple positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for neurooncology, there is a need to define the appropriate tracer in a given clinical setting, and it is in this regard that we undertook this study to directly compare F-18 flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and C-11 methionine (MET) PET for the evaluation of recurrence in primary brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with a history of treated primary brain tumors referred for evaluation of recurrent disease were initially included in the study. Two patients had to be excluded because of insufficient follow-up. There were 23 males and 12 females, mean age: 33.7 +/- 16.4 years; range: 5 to 65 years. All patients underwent the MET and FDG study on the same day. Visual image interpretation was performed independently by 2 PET physicians for each tracer using the plain PET and fused PET/CT images; the FDG images were evaluated first. Images were analyzed semiquantitatively using tumor to normal contralateral cortex ratios (T/N). Each patient was followed up for a minimum of 18 months. Imaging results were compared with histopathology on tumor excision or biopsy in 14 patients and with clinical follow-up and MRI/MRS at the end of 18 months in 21 patients. RESULTS: The final diagnosis was tumor recurrence in 24 patients and no recurrence/stable disease in 11 patients. On FDG, findings in 15/35 (42%) were suggestive of recurrent tumors. On MET, findings in 24/34 (70.5%) cases were suggestive of recurrent tumors. Spatially separated secondary lesions including intraventricular deposits were clearly delineated in 5 cases, 3 were glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 2 were anaplastic astrocytomas. One of the secondary lesions was missed on FDG PET. Using a cutoff for T/N ratio on FDG of >0.75 to differentiate recurrence from no recurrence, sensitivity of FDG was 81.2% (confidence interval [CI] = 54.4%-96%), whereas specificity was 88.9% (CI = 51.8%-99.7%). Area under the curve was 0.819 (CI = 0.615-0.943), P = 0.0003. Using a cutoff for T/N ratio of >1.9 to differentiate recurrence from no recurrence, sensitivity of MET was 94.7% (CI = 74.0%-99.9%), whereas specificity was 88.89% (CI = 51.8%-99.7%). Area under the curve was 0.942 (CI = 0.785-0.995), P < 0.0001. Interobserver agreement, kappa coefficient, for MET was 0.93, suggesting good interobserver agreement, whereas for FDG, it was fair (0.23). CONCLUSIONS: MET should be the radiotracer of choice in the evaluation of recurrence of primary brain tumors because the sensitivity for detection and delineation of the possible recurrent tumor, as well as secondary deposits, is higher with MET. MET-PET is an easier technique to interpret, irrespective of the glioma grade, with less interobserver variability and straightforward localization of tumorous accumulation.

Title: Diagnostic Value of 11C-Methionine (MET) and 18F-Fluorothymidine (FLT) Positron Emission Tomography in Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas; Differentiation from Treatment-Induced Tissue Necrosis.
Abstract: We retrospectively evaluated the usefulness of combined measurement of L-methyl-[11C]methionine (MET) and 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) in the differential diagnosis between recurrent gliomas and necrotic lesions. Twenty-one patients with high-grade glioma, previously treated with surgery and radiotherapy with chemotherapy and first radiological suspicion of recurrence were enrolled. The uptake was assessed by the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and lesion-to-normal tissue count density ratio (L/N ratio). Of the 21 lesions, 15 were diagnosed recurrent gliomas and six were necrotic lesions. The average SUVmax was not significantly different between recurrent gliomas and necrotic lesions on either MET-PET or FLT-PET. The average L/N ratio of recurrent gliomas (3.36 +/- 1.06) was significantly higher than that of necrotic lesions (2.18 +/- 0.66) on MET-PET (p < 0.01) and the average L/N ratio of recurrent gliomas (7.01 +/- 2.26) was also significantly higher than that of necrotic lesions (4.60 +/- 1.23) on FLT-PET (p < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the areas under the curves were high but not different between MET- and FLT-PET. PET studies using MET and FLT are useful in the differentiation of recurrent glioma from treatment-induced necrotic lesion. However, there is no complementary information in the differentiation with simultaneous measurements of MET- and FLT-PET.

Title: Imaging of non- or very subtle contrast-enhancing malignant gliomas with [(1)(1)C]-methionine positron emission tomography.
Abstract: In patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III glioma with a lack of or minimal (< 1 cm3) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement, the volume of the metabolically active part of the tumor was assessed by [(1)(1)C]-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET). Eleven patients with WHO grade III gliomas underwent MET-PET and MRI (contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images). To calculate the volumes in cubic centimeters, threshold-based volume of interest analyses of the metabolically active tumor (MET uptake index >/= 1.3), contrast enhancement, and the T2 lesion were performed after coregistration of all images. In all patients, the metabolically active tumor volume was larger than the volume of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement (20.8 +/- 18.8 vs 0.29 +/- 0.25 cm3; p < .001). With the exception of one patient, the volumes of contrast enhancement were located within the metabolically active tumor volume. In contrast, in the majority of patients, MET uptake overlapped with the T2 lesion and reached beyond it (in 10 of 12 MRIs/MET-PET scans). The present data suggest that in patients with WHO grade III glioma with minimal or a lack of contrast enhancement, MET-PET delineates metabolically active tumor tissue. These findings support the use of combined PET-MRI with radiolabeled amino acids (eg, MET) for the delineating of the true extent of active tumor in the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with gliomas.

Title: Independent prognostic value of pre-treatment 18-FDG-PET in high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The prognostic value of PET with (18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) has been shown in high-grade gliomas (HGG), but not compared with consensual prognostic factors. We sought to evaluate the independent predictive value of pre-treatment FDG-PET on overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). We retrospectively analyzed 41 patients with histologically-confirmed HGG (31 glioblastomas and 10 anaplastic gliomas). The pre-treatment uptake of FDG was assessed qualitatively by five-step visual metabolic grading, and quantitatively by the ratio between the tumor and contralateral maximal standardized uptake value (T/CL). EFS and OS following PET were compared with FDG uptake by univariate analysis, and by two multivariate analyses: one including main consensual prognostic factors (age, KPS, extent of surgery and histological grade), and the other including the classification system of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (Recursive Partitioning Analysis, RPA). Median OS and EFS were 13.8 and 7.4 months, respectively, for glioblastomas, and over 25.8 and 12 months, respectively, for anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.040 and P = 0.027). The T/CL ratio predicted OS in the entire group [P = 0.003; Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.3] and in the glioblastoma subgroup (P = 0.018; HR = 2), independently of age, Karnofsky performance status, histological grade, and surgery, and independently of RPA classification. T/CL ratio tended to predict EFS in the whole group (P = 0.052). The prognostic value of visual metabolic grade on OS was less significant than T/CL ratio, both in the entire group and in the glioblastoma subgroup (P = 0.077 and P = 0.059). Quantitative evaluation of the ratio between the maximal tumor and contralateral uptake in pre-treatment FDG-PET provides significant additional prognostic information in newly-diagnosed HGG, independently of consensual prognostic factors.

Title: Systemic Endoradiotherapy with Carrier-Added 4-[(131)I]Iodo-L-Phenylalanine: Clinical Proof-of-Principle in Refractory Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore feasibility, tolerability, dosimetry and probable efficacy of intravenous endoradiotherapy with carrier-added 4-[(131)I]iodo-L-phenylalanine (c.a. (131)I-IPA) in refractory high-grade glioma. METHODS: Two male patients (45 and 50 years), with long-standing, extensively pre-treated gliomas and evidence of progression underwent single intravenous injections of 2 and 4 GBq of c.a. (131)I-IPA, respectively. Tumour targeting was verified by (131)I-IPA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Metabolic and morphological changes indicative of tumour response were assessed by sequential [(18)F]fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following therapy. Further monitoring included clinical state, safety laboratory, quality of life and dosimetry. Absorbed mean organ and whole-body doses were determined according to the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) scheme using OLINDAEXM based on serial planar scintigraphy. RESULTS: Both patients tolerated the treatment well. No evidence of acute or delayed organ toxicity was observed. (131)I-IPA accumulated in the tumour recurrences identified by MRI/(18)F-FET. In patient 1, PET showed progressively decreasing maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) over 10 months, indicating metabolic response, paralleled by reduced contrast enhancement and tumour volume on MRI. Progression occurred 18 months after therapy. Treatment was repeated using 6.6 GBq of (131)I-IPA, to which no response was observed. Patient 2, followed-up for 3 months after therapy, showed stable disease on MRI and PET. Mean absorbed whole body doses ranged from 0.13 to 0.17 mSv/MBq, with the highest absorbed organ doses to kidneys, bladder and heart (0.86-1.23; 0.49-0.6 and 0.45-0.56 mSv/MBq). CONCLUSION: Systemic endoradiotherapy using up to 6.6 GBq of c.a.(131)I-IPA is not associated with clinically detectable toxicity. Measurable anti-tumour effects in gliomas were observed. (131)I-IPA warrants further evaluation as glioma therapy.

Title: Concurrent temozolomide and dose-escalated intensity-modulated radiation therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation (RT) with concurrent temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), to estimate their progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to assess the role of (11)C methionine PET (MET-PET) imaging in predicting recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) doses of 66 to 81 Gy, assigned to patients by the time-to-event continual reassessment method, were delivered over 6 weeks with concurrent daily temozolomide (75 mg/m(2)) followed by adjuvant cyclic temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) d1-5 q28d x6 cycles). Treatment was based on gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Pretreatment MET-PET scans were obtained for correlation with eventual sites of failure. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 54 months for patients who remain alive. Late CNS grade >/=III toxicity was observed at 78 (2 of 7 patients) and 81 Gy (1 of 9 patients). None of 22 patients receiving 75 or less Gy developed RT necrosis. Median OS and PFS were 20.1 (14.0-32.5) and 9.0 (6.0-11.7) months, respectively. Twenty-two of 32 patients with pretreatment MET-PET uptake showed uptake beyond the contrast-enhanced MRI. Patients whose treatment did not include the region of increased MET-PET uptake showed an increased risk of noncentral failure (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GBM can safely receive standard temozolomide with 75 Gy in 30 fractions, delivered using IMRT. The median OS of 20.1 months is promising. Furthermore, MET-PET appears to predict regions of high risk of recurrence not defined by MRI, suggesting that further improvements may be possible by targeting metabolically active regions.

Title: Role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography scan in differentiating enhancing brain tumors.
Abstract: AIM: To determine whether F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) can be used to differentiate among common enhancing brain tumors such as gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 20 patients with an enhancing brain tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FDG PET scan was done in all patients pre operatively. For PET image analysis, regions of interest were placed over the tumor (T), contralateral cortex (C), and white matter (WM). Average and maximum pixel values were determined at each site. On the basis of these measurements, average and maximum standard uptake values (SUV avg and SUV max ) were calculated, and comparisons among lesions were then made. RESULTS: SUVavg and SUVmax are significantly higher for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma than for other tumors (P < 0.01). High-grade gliomas showed significantly higher SUVavg and SUVmax than the low grade gliomas (P < 0.05) and metastatic tumor showed higher SUVavg and SUVmax than all gliomas, both low and high grade (P < 0.05). When the lowest values of CNS lymphoma parameter were used as cutoff levels to distinguish CNS lymphomas from other tumors (i.e. 100% sensitivity), SUVmax was the most accurate parameter. Using a SUVmax of 15.0 as a cutoff for diagnosing CNS lymphoma, only one case of metastasis (SUV max , 16.3) was found to be false positive in this study. CONCLUSION: FDG PET appears to provide additional information for differentiating common enhancing malignant brain tumors, namely lymphoma versus high grade glioma and metastatic tumor, particularly when differential diagnoses are difficult to narrow using MRI alone.

Title: Dynamic O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (F-18 FET) PET for glioma grading: assessment of individual probability of malignancy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: (1) To investigate the diagnostic value of some O-(2-[F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (F-18 FET) indices derived from the dynamic acquisition to differentiate low-grade gliomas from high-grade; (2) to analyze the course of tumor time-activity curves (TACs); and (3) to calculate the individual probability of a high-grade glioma using the logistic regression. METHODS: Seventeen low-grade (WHO I-II) and 15 high-grade (WHO III-IV) gliomas were studied with dynamic F-18 FET PET. Regions of interests were drawn over the tumor and contralateral brain, and TACs were analyzed. We considered early standardized uptake value (SUV), middle SUV, late SUV, early-to-middle SUV tumor ratio, early-to-late SUV tumor ratio; time to peak (Tpeak), in minutes, from the beginning of the dynamic acquisition up to the maximum SUV of the tumor; and SoD (sum of the frame-to-frame differences). To assess the individual probability of high-grade, logistic regression was also used. RESULTS: High-grade gliomas showed significantly (P < 0.0001) higher values when compared with low-grade gliomas in early SUV, early-to-middle ratio, early-to-late ratio, Tpeak, and SoD. For the grading of gliomas, the best indices were early-to-middle ratio and Tpeak providing a diagnostic accuracy of 94%. TACs analysis provided an 87% diagnostic accuracy. For individual high-grade diagnosis, the logistic regression provided 93% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 97% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Early-to-middle SUV tumor ratio and Tpeak were the best indices for assessing the grading of gliomas. Since early-to-middle ratio derives from the first 35 minutes of the dynamic acquisition, the PET study could last half an hour instead of 1 hour. By logistic regression, it is possible to assess the individual probability of high-grade, useful for prognosis and treatment.

Title: Discriminant analysis of (1)(8)F-fluorothymidine kinetic parameters to predict survival in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether changes in 3'-deoxy-3'-[(1)(8)F]fluorothymidine ((1)(8)F-FLT) kinetic parameters, taken early after the start of therapy, could predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent malignant glioma undergoing treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: High-grade recurrent brain tumors were investigated in 18 patients (8 male and 10 female), ages 26 to 76 years. Each had 3 dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies as follows: at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks from the start of treatment, (1)(8)F-FLT (2.0 MBq/kg) was injected intravenously, and dynamic PET images were acquired for 1 hour. Factor analysis generated factor images from which blood and tumor uptake curves were derived. A three-compartment, two-tissue model was applied to estimate tumor (1)(8)F-FLT kinetic rate constants using a metabolite- and partial volume-corrected input function. Different combinations of predictor variables were exhaustively searched in a discriminant function to accurately classify patients into their known OS and PFS groups. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to assess the generalizability of the model predictions. RESULTS: In this study population, changes in single parameters such as standardized uptake value or influx rate constant did not accurately classify patients into their respective OS groups (<1 and >/= 1 year; hit ratios </= 78%). However, changes in a set of (1)(8)F-FLT kinetic parameters could perfectly separate these two groups of patients (hit ratio = 100%) and were also able to correctly classify patients into their respective PFS groups (<100 and >/= 100 days; hit ratio = 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Discriminant analysis using changes in (1)(8)F-FLT kinetic parameters early during treatment seems to be a powerful method for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic regimens.

Title: A phase II trial of single-agent bevacizumab in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of single-agent bevacizumab in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma and assess correlative advanced imaging parameters. Patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma were treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Complete patient evaluations were repeated every 4 weeks. Correlative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging studies were obtained to evaluate physiologic changes in tumor and tumor vasculature at time points including baseline, 96 h after the first dose, and after the first 4 weeks of therapy. Median overall survival was 12 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.08-22.8). Median progression-free survival was 2.93 months (95% CI: 2.01-4.93), and 6-month progression-free survival was 20.9% (95% CI: 10.3%-42.5%). Thirteen (43%) patients achieved a partial response. The most common grade >/= 3 treatment-related toxicities were hypertension, hypophosphatemia, and thromboembolism. Single-agent bevacizumab produces significant radiographic response in patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma but did not meet the 6-month progression-free survival endpoint. Early change in enhancing tumor volume at 4 days after start of therapy was the most significant prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survival.

Title: (1)(1)C-methionine uptake and intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence as separate index markers of cell density in glioma: a stereotactic image-histological analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The extent of tumor resection is acknowledged as 1 of the prognostic factors for glioma. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence guidance and neuronavigation integrated with (11) C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) are widely utilized under the expectation of improving the extent of resection. These 2 novel approaches are beneficial for glioma resections, and the combination of these approaches appears rational. However, biological characteristics reflecting 5-ALA-induced fluorescence and (11) C-methionine uptake have not been clearly elucidated, and studies about the relationship between 5-ALA-induced fluorescence and (11) C-methionine uptake have been limited. The present study aimed to clarify this issue. METHODS: Data from 11 consecutive patients harboring astrocytic tumors were analyzed: 2 grade II and 2 grade III, and 7 grade IV tumors were included. Thirty samples from these patients were obtained from the relative periphery of each tumor. Relationships among histology, 5-ALA-induced fluorescence and (11) C-methionine uptake were analyzed by stereotactic sampling and image analysis. RESULTS: Uptake of (11) C-methionine correlated with cell density (R(2) = 0.322, P = .0059). Cell density was higher in fluorescence-positive areas than in negative areas (2760 +/- 1080 vs 1450 +/- 1380/mm(2) , P = .0132). Although both (11) C-methionine uptake and fluorescence seemed to correlate with cell density, no significant difference in (11) C-methionine uptake was seen between fluorescence-positive and -negative areas (P = .367). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed (11) C-methionine uptake and 5-ALA-induced fluorescence as independent indices for tumor cell density. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 5-ALA fluorescence and (11) C-methionine PET image are separate index markers for cytoreduction surgery of gliomas.

Title: Advances in PET imaging of brain tumors: a referring physician's perspective.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the most recent advances in PET imaging of brain tumors, aiming at expanding the referring physician's knowledge in the field, the sine qua non for translating PET into the practice of neuro-oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: The role of PET with amino acid tracers in the setting of brain lesions of unknown significance has been better defined, reducing the need for invasive procedures. The impact of PET-guided resection of high-grade glioma using (1)(1)C-methionine ((1)(1)C-MET) has been strongly documented. [(1)(8)F]Fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine is currently available for glioma management; advances in targeting glial tumor biopsy and monitoring response to standard chemoradiation of malignant glioma have been remarkable. 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-penta-fluoropropyl)-acetamide is a rationally designed radiotracer with potential for imaging hypoxia in glioblastoma. New insights regarding the predictive value of 3-deoxy-3-[(1)(8)F]fluorothymidine in outcome of recurrent malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab/irinotecan have been provided. First steps are being made toward apoptosis PET imaging for early assessment of radiotherapy response in brain metastases. SUMMARY: The use of (1)(1)C-MET and (1)(8)F-labeled PET tracers is getting a more precise position in the management of brain tumors. Advances hold promises in routine decision-making and in the design and conduct of clinical trials.

Title: Photon and proton therapy planning comparison for malignant glioma based on CT, FDG-PET, DTI-MRI and fiber tracking.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare treatment plans generated using fixed beam Intensity Modulated photon Radiation Therapy (IMRT), inversely optimized arc therapy (RapidArc(R), RA) with spot-scanned Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) for high-grade glioma patients. Plans were compared with respect to target coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OARs), with special attention to the possibility of hippocampus sparing. METHOD: Fifteen consecutive patients diagnosed with grade III and IV glioma were selected for this study. The target and OARs were delineated based on computed tomography (CT), FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) and T1-, T2-weigted, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fiber-tracking. In this study, a 6 MV photon beam on a linear accelerator with a multileaf collimator (MLC) with 2.5 mm leaves and a spot-scanning proton therapy machine were used. Two RA fields, using both a coplanar (clinical standard) and a non-coplanar, setup was compared to the IMRT and IMPT techniques. Three and three to four non-coplanar fields where used in the spot-scanned IMPT and IMRT plans, respectively. The same set of planning dose-volume optimizer objective values were used for the four techniques. The highest planning priority was given to the brainstem (maximum 54 Gy) followed by the PTV (prescription 60 Gy); the hippocampi, eyes, inner ears, brain and chiasm were given lower priority. Doses were recorded for the plans to targets and OARs and compared to our clinical standard technique using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULT: The PTV coverage was significantly more conform for IMPT than the coplanar RA technique, while RA plans tended to be more conform than the IMRT plans, as measured by the standard deviation of the PTV dose. In the cases where the tumor was confined in one cerebral hemisphere (eight patients), the non-coplanar RA and IMPT techniques yielded borderline significantly lower doses to the contralateral hippocampus compared to the standard (22% and 97% average reduction for non-coplanar RA and IMPT, respectively). The IMPT technique allowed for the largest healthy tissue sparing of the techniques in terms of whole brain doses and to the fiber tracts. The maximum doses to the chiasm and brainstem were comparable for all techniques. CONCLUSION: The IMPT technique produced the most conform plans. For tumors located in the one of the cerebral hemispheres, the non-coplanar RA and the IMPT techniques were able to reduce doses to the contralateral hippocampus. The IMPT technique offered the largest sparing of the brain and fiber tracts. RA techniques tended to produce more conform target doses than IMRT.

Title: F-18 FDG PET-CT for predicting survival in patients with recurrent glioma: a prospective study.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Recurrent gliomas are usually histologically high grade; either due to recurrence of a de novo high-grade primary or anaplastic transformation in case of low-grade tumors. Survival in these patients is variable. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the role of FDG PET-CT for predicting survival in a large group of patients with suspected recurrent glioma. METHODS: A total of 81 previously treated histopathologically proven glioma patients; with clinical and conventional imaging findings suspicious of recurrence were included in this study. All patients underwent FDG PET-CT study. Based on tumor to white matter (T/W) and tumor to grey matter (T/G) ratios, all lesions were scored on PET-CT (PET scores 0, 1 and 2). Patients were followed up clinically and by repeated imaging. Data was censored, if the patient died of disease or at the end of the study. Survival analysis was done for each variable employing univariate analysis followed by multivariate analysis, using variables found significant on univariate analysis. RESULTS: PET score was found to be the most significant predictor of survival in univariate and multivariate analysis (p 0.003). Patients having PET score 2 had poorer survival compared to both PET score 0 (p 0.001) and PET score 1 (p 0.004). Other covariates found to have significant correlation with survival were primary treatment modality and clinical symptoms at the time of recurrence. CONCLUSION: FDG uptake on PET-CT is a strong predictor of survival in patients with suspected recurrent glioma.

Title: Detection of recurrence in glioma: a comparative prospective study between Tc-99m GHA SPECT and F-18 FDG PET/CT.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early and correct diagnosis of tumor recurrence and its differentiation from therapy-related changes is crucial for prompt and adequate management of glioma patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacies of Tc-99m glucoheptonate (GHA) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detection of recurrence in patients with glioma. METHODS: A total of 90 patients with histopathologically proven glioma who had suspicion of recurrence clinically or on magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated using Tc-99m GHA SPECT and FDG PET/CT. Combination of clinical follow-up, repeat imaging, and biopsy (when available) was taken as gold standard. RESULTS: On the basis of gold standard, 59 patients were positive and 31 were negative for tumor recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of GHA SPECT were 85%, 97%, and 89%, respectively, whereas those of FDG PET/CT were 70%, 97%, and 80%, respectively. On subgroup analysis, GHA SPECT performed better than FDG PET/CT in all grades except for grade II gliomas, where both were equally effective. In all, 15 patients had intermodality discordance, with GHA SPECT being correct in 13 of them. CONCLUSIONS: GHA SPECT appears to be a better imaging modality than FDG PET/CT for detection of recurrent gliomas.

Title: Trans sodium crocetinate: functional neuroimaging studies in a hypoxic brain tumor.
Abstract: OBJECT: Intratumoral hypoxia is believed to be exhibited in high-grade gliomas. Trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) has been shown to increase oxygen diffusion to hypoxic tissues. In this research, the authors use oxygen-sensitive PET studies to evaluate the extent of hypoxia in vivo in a glioblastoma model and the effect of TSC on the baseline oxygenation of the tumor. METHODS: The C6 glioma cells were stereotactically implanted in the right frontal region of rat brains. Formation of intracranial tumors was confirmed on MR imaging. Animals were injected with Copper(II) diacetyl-di(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-ATSM) and then either TSC or saline (6 rats each). Positron emission tomography imaging was performed, and relative uptake values were computed to determine oxygenation within the tumor and normal brain parenchyma. Additionally, TSC or saline was infused into the animals, and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducing factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression were measured 1 day afterward. RESULTS: On PET imaging, all glioblastoma tumors demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in uptake of Cu-ATSM compared with the contralateral cerebral hemisphere (p = 0.000002). The mean relative uptake value of the tumor was 3900 (range 2203-6836), and that of the contralateral brain tissue was 1017 (range 488-2304). The mean relative hypoxic tumor volume for the saline group and TSC group (6 rats each) was 1.01 +/- 0.063 and 0.69 +/- 0.062, respectively (mean +/- SEM, p = 0.002). Infusion of TSC resulted in a 31% decrease in hypoxic volume. Immunoblot analysis revealed expression of HIF-1alpha and CA9 in all tumor specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Some glioblastomas exhibit hypoxia that is demonstrable on oxygen-specific PET imaging. It appears that TSC lessens intratumoral hypoxia on functional imaging. Further studies should explore relative hypoxia in glioblastoma and the potential therapeutic gains that can be achieved by lessening hypoxia during delivery of adjuvant treatment.

Title: IDH mutation status impact on in vivo hypoxia biomarkers expression: new insights from a clinical, nuclear imaging and immunohistochemical study in 33 glioma patients.
Abstract: Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme isoforms 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) have recently been identified in a large proportion of glial tumors of the CNS, but their mechanistic role in tumor development remains unclear. Here, we assessed the actual impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in patients harboring WHO grade II and III gliomas. We sequenced IDH1 at codon 132 and IDH2 at codon 172 in 33 patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas who benefited from a preoperative (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Immunohistochemical expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX), Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1) and Caspase 3 active form (CASP3) along with the R132HIDH1 mutation was assessed in all cases as well as 1p/19q deletion status and p53 expression. HIF-1alpha expression was found in 15% of IDH-mutated compared to 7.7% of IDH-nonmutated tumors (P = 0.954). Also, GLUT-1 positive staining was found in 5% of IDH-mutated and in 7.1% of IDH-nonmutated tumors (P = 0.794). Finally, CA-IX expression was found in 15% of IDH-mutated and in 7.7% of IDH-nonmutated tumors (P = 0.484). The combined expression of these three hypoxic markers was found in two WHO grade III tumors, one of which was IDH-mutated whereas the other was IDH-nonmutated (P = 0.794). In IDH-mutated tumors, the median SUVmax ratio was 2.24 versus 2.15 in IDH-nonmutated tumors (P = 0.775). Together, these data question the actual relationship between IDH mutation status and in vivo hypoxic biomarkers expression in WHO grade II and III gliomas.

Title: O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET predicts failure of antiangiogenic treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to compare MRI response assessment with metabolic O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET response evaluation during antiangiogenic treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG). METHODS: Eleven patients with rHGG were treated biweekly with bevacizumab-irinotecan. MR images and (18)F-FET PET scans were obtained at baseline and at follow-up 8-12 wk after treatment onset. MRI treatment response was evaluated by T1/T2 volumetry according to response assessment in neurooncology (RANO) criteria. For (18)F-FET PET evaluation, an uptake reduction of more than 45% calculated with a standardized uptake value of more than 1.6 was defined as a metabolic response (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). MRI and (18)F-FET PET volumetry results and response assessment were compared with each other and in relation to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: At follow-up, MR images showed partial response in 7 of 11 patients (64%), stable disease in 2 of 11 patients (18%), and tumor progression in 2 of 11 patients (18%). In contrast, (18)F-FET PET revealed 5 of 11 metabolic responders (46%) and 6 of 11 nonresponders (54%). MRI and (18)F-FET PET showed that responders survived significantly longer than did nonresponders (10.24 vs. 4.1 mo, P = 0.025, and 7.9 vs. 2.3 mo, P = 0.015, respectively). In 4 patients (36.4%), diagnosis according to RANO criteria and (18)F-FET PET was discordant. In these cases, PET was able to detect tumor progression earlier than was MRI. CONCLUSION: In rHGG patients undergoing antiangiogenic treatment, (18)F-FET PET seems to be predictive for treatment failure in that it contributes important information to response assessment based solely on MRI and RANO criteria.

Title: Pseudoprogression: relevance with respect to treatment of high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The post-treatment imaging assessment of high-grade gliomas remains challenging notwithstanding the increased utilization of advanced MRI and PET imaging. Several post-treatment imaging entities are recognized including: late-delayed radiation injury, including radionecrosis mimicking tumor progression; early-delayed (within 6 months of temozolomide-based chemoradiation) post-treatment radiographic changes, herein referred to as pseudoprogression (the subject of this review); early post-treatment changes following local glioma therapy (i.e. biodegradable BCNU wafer implantation or stereotactic radiotherapy); and pseudoresponse, seen following treatment with angiogenic inhibition based therapy such as bevacizumab. A literature review searched specifically for "pseudoprogression" within the last 5 years (2005-2010). Approximately 24 recent papers were identified and reviewed in detail. Eight small population-based studies demonstrate 26-58% (median 49%) of glioblastoma patients treated with chemoradiotherapy manifest early disease progression at first post-radiotherapy imaging. Patients with early radiographic disease progression continued on planned therapy, and a median of 38% (range 28-66%) showed radiographic improvement or stabilization and were defined retrospectively as manifesting pseudoprogression. In conclusion, pseudoprogression is a frequent early post-treatment imaging change that at present is not easily differentiated from tumor progression by anatomic or physiologic brain imaging. Consequently, an operational definition of pseudoprogression has been adopted by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group wherein either the index (i.e. target) lesion stabilizes or diminishes in size on continued post-radiation (temozolomide) therapy as determined by follow-up radiologic imaging.

Title: Finding the anaplastic focus in diffuse gliomas: the value of Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI, FET-PET, and intraoperative, ALA-derived tissue fluorescence.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Diffuse gliomas may harbor anaplastic foci which affect prognosis and determine adjuvant therapies. Such foci are not always detected by contrast-enhancement on MRI. Recently, other modalities have been introduced, such as FET-PET for pre-diagnostic imaging and 5-aminolevulinic derived tumor fluorescence for intraoperative identification of malignant glioma tissue. The relationship between these modalities and their value for guiding biopsies during resection has not yet been elucidated in the group of diffuse gliomas. METHODS: FET-PET was performed in 30 consecutive patients with intracerebral lesions suggestive of diffuse gliomas on MRI with or without areas of contrast-enhancement. Prior to surgery patients were given 5-ALA at a dose of 20mg/kg body weight. Areas of FET uptake with a lesion/brain ratio of 1.6 or more were considered indicators of tumor. FET-PET data were corregistered with MRI data before surgery in order to obtain neuronavigated biopsies during resection, which were collected from FET positive and negative areas, analyzed for tumor fluorescence and correlated to contrast-enhancement on MRI. RESULTS: 13 of 30 tumors were diagnosed as gliomas WHO Grade II, 15 as gliomas WHO Grade III and 2 as gliomas WHO Grade IV. The mean lesion/brain tissue ratio of FET uptake was significantly greater for high-grade than for low-grade gliomas (averages SD 2.323+/-0.754 vs. 1.453+/-0.538 p=0.0014). A match of FET-pos/ALA-pos biopsies was found in 70.6% (12/17) of high-grade gliomas (WHO Grade III/IV) but only in 7.7% (1/13) of low grade gliomas. Gd-neg/FET-neg/ALA-neg biopsies yielded a low-grade tumor in 46.2% (6/13). A mismatch between FET uptake and 5-ALA (FET-pos/ALA-neg) was found in 46.2% (6/13) of the low-grade and in 17.6% (3/17) of the high-grade tumors. The combination of FET-PET- and 5-ALA-positivity yielded a sensitivity for identifying high-grade glioma foci of 70.5% and a specificity of 92.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In low grade gliomas 5-ALA fluorescence is the exception and FET PET is more sensitive. High grade areas in diffuse gliomas with anaplastic foci usually fluoresce, if they are FET PET positive. As a result, FET PET appears valuable for pre-operative identification of anaplastic foci and hot spots are strongly predictive for ALA-derived fluorescence, which highlight anaplastic foci during resection.

Title: Primary intracerebral malignant fibrous histiocytoma: CT, MRI, and PET-CT findings.
Abstract: Primary intracranial malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is an extremely rare entity. A few reported cases have been associated with factors such as a previous history of radiation therapy or surgical trauma. We report on a rare case of intracerebral MFH in a previously healthy 47-year-old man, which was initially presumed to be a high-grade glioma. Conventional as well as advanced magnetic resonance sequences, including diffusion-weighted image and perfusion-weighted image, were used in characterization of the mass.

Title: F-18 FDG PET-CT in patients with recurrent glioma: comparison with contrast enhanced MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacies of FDG PET-CT and contrast enhanced MRI in detection of recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Ninety histopathologically proven glioma patients with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated. All patients underwent FDG PET-CT scan and contrast enhanced MRI. Combination of clinical follow up, repeat imaging and biopsy (when available) was taken as gold standard. RESULTS: Based on gold standard criteria, 59 patients were positive and 31 patients were negative for recurrence. Overall sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT were 70% and 97% respectively whereas that for contrast enhanced MRI was 95% and 23%. FDG PET-CT also has higher accuracy (80%) as compared to MRI (70%). FGD PET-CT has lower sensitivity than MRI in all grades, except for Grade II gliomas where their sensitivities are comparable (95% and 90%). Very low specificity of MRI was observed in all grades of tumour (18-33%). In contrast the specificity of FDG PET-CT was high across all grades (83-100%). CONCLUSION: FDG PET-CT is a highly specific modality for detecting recurrence in patients with gliomas and can effectively exclude post therapy changes.

Title: Brain tumors.
Abstract: For most cancers, PET is essentially a diagnostic tool. For brain tumors, PET has got its main contribution at the level of the therapeutic management. Indeed, specific reasons render the therapeutic management of brain tumors, especially gliomas, a real challenge. Although some gliomas may appear well-delineated on conventional neuroimaging such as CT and MRI, they are by nature infiltrating neoplasms and the interface between tumor and normal brain tissue may not be accurately defined. Moreover, gliomas may present as ill-defined lesions for which various MRI sequences combination does not provide a unique contour for tumor delineation. Also, gliomas are often histologically heterogeneous with anaplastic areas evolving within a low-grade tumor, and contrast-enhancement on CT or MRI does not represent a good marker for anaplastic tissue detection. Finally, assessment of tumor residue, recurrence, or progression, may be altered by different signals related to inflammation or adjuvant therapies, and contrast enhancement on CT and MRI is not an appropriate marker at the postoperative or posttherapeutic stage. These limitations of conventional neuroimaging in detecting tumor tissue, delineating tumor extent and evidencing anaplastic changes, lead to potential inaccuracy in lesion targeting at different steps of the management (diagnostic, surgical, postoperative, and posttherapeutic stages). Molecular information provided by PET has proved helpful to supplement morphological imaging data in this context. F-18 FDG and amino-acid tracers such as C-11 methionine (C-11 MET) provide complementary metabolic data that are independent from the anatomical MR information. These tracers help in the definition of glioma extension, detection of anaplastic areas, and postoperative follow-up. Additionally, PET data have a prognostic value independently of histology. To take advantage of PET data in glioma treatment, PET might be integrated in the planning of image-guided biopsy, resection, and radiosurgery.

Title: Assessment of type of allergy and antihistamine use in the development of glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergies have been associated with decreased risk of glioma; but, associations between duration and timing of allergies, and antihistamine use and glioma risk have been less consistent. The objective was to investigate this association by analyzing types, number, years since diagnosis, and age at diagnosis of allergies, and information on antihistamine usage, including type, duration, and frequency of exposure. METHODS: Self-report data on medically diagnosed allergies and antihistamine use were obtained for 419 glioma cases and 612 hospital-based controls from Duke University and NorthShore University HealthSystem. RESULTS: High- and low-grade glioma cases were statistically significantly less likely to report any allergy than controls (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87 and OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.76, respectively). The number of types of allergies (seasonal, medication, pet, food, and other) was inversely associated with glioma risk in a dose-response manner (P value for trend < 0.05). Age at diagnosis and years since diagnosis of allergies were not associated with glioma risk. Oral antihistamine use was statistically significantly inversely associated with glioma risk, but when stratified by allergy status, remained significant only for those with high-grade glioma and no medically diagnosed allergy. CONCLUSIONS: All types of allergies appear to be protective with reduced risk for those with more types of allergies. Antihistamine use, other than in relationship with allergy status, may not influence glioma risk. IMPACT: A comprehensive study of allergies and antihistamine use using standardized questions and biological markers will be essential to further delineate the biological mechanism that may be involved in brain tumor development.

Title: Hot spots in dynamic (18)FET-PET delineate malignant tumor parts within suspected WHO grade II gliomas.
Abstract: Molecular imaging studies have recently found inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in World Health Organization (WHO) grade II gliomas. A correlative analysis with tumor histology, however, is still lacking. For elucidation we conducted the current prospective study. Fifty-five adult patients with an MRI-based suspicion of a WHO grade II glioma were included. [F-18]Fluoroethyltyrosine ((18)FET) uptake kinetic studies were combined with frame-based stereotactic localization techniques and used as a guide for stepwise (1-mm steps) histopathological evaluation throughout the tumor space. In tumors with heterogeneous PET findings, the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status and expression of mutated protein isocitrate dehydrogenase variant R132H (IDH1) were determined inside and outside of hot spot volumes. Metabolic imaging revealed 3 subgroups: the homogeneous WHO grade II glioma group (30 patients), the homogeneous malignant glioma group (10 patients), and the heterogeneous group exhibiting both low- and high-grade characteristics at different sites (15 patients). Stepwise evaluation of 373 biopsy samples indicated a strong correlation with analyses of uptake kinetics (p < 0.0001). A homogeneous pattern of uptake kinetics was linked to homogeneous histopathological findings, whereas a heterogeneous pattern was associated with histopathological heterogeneity; hot spots exhibiting malignant glioma characteristics covered 4-44% of the entire tumor volumes. Both MGMT and IDH1 status were identical at different tumor sites and not influenced by heterogeneity. Maps of (18)FET uptake kinetics strongly correlated with histopathology in suspected grade II gliomas. Anaplastic foci can be accurately identified, and this finding has implications for prognostic evaluation and treatment planning.

Title: [Prognostic value of PET using 11C-methionine in patients with untreated cerebral gliomas].
Abstract: We evaluated the prognostic role of positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-methionine in adults with untreated supratentorial glioma. Histopathologic grading and clinical follow-up data were available from 147 patients with low-grade (n=74) and high-grade gliomas (n=73). Follow-up was conducted until the last clinical contact (n=79) or until death (n=68). The 11C-methionine uptake index (UI) was calculated as the tumor hot spot-to-normal cortex uptake ratio. In the univariate analysis the statistical support from clinical, histological, and PET parameters was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. For all glioma patients age (<40 or > or = 40 years), astrocytoma histopathology and WHO grading class (low versus high), extent of the increased 11C-methionine uptake (<6 cm or > or = 6), were found to be significant predictors of survival by univariate analysis. For all grades of gliomas UI higher than 2.0 was statistically associated with a shorter survival (p=0.00001). Patient sex, glioma location, pattern of the 11C-methionine uptake were not significantly predictive. In the most patients UI was closely associated with glioma histopathology. However separate analysis of astrocytoma subgroups showed that PET with "C-methionine was a more reliable prognostic factor in case of conflict between metabolic characteristic and histopathology findings. A high uptake of 11C-methionine and large extent of increased 11C-methionine accumulation were statistically associated with a poor survival time. Results showed that PET with 11C-methionine may be useful for determinating the prognosis of patients with primary glioma and this information can provide aid in making treatment decision.

Title: Comparison of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography for assessment of brain tumor progression.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We investigated the accuracy of high-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H MRS) and fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18) F-FDG-PET) for diagnosis of glioma progression following tumor resection, stereotactic radiation, and chemotherapy. METHODS: Twelve post-therapy patients with histology proven gliomas (six grade II and six grade III) presented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical symptoms suggestive but not conclusive of progression were entered into the study. (1) H MRS data were acquired and 3-dimensional volumetric maps of choline (Cho) over creatine (Cr) were generated. Intensity of (18) F-FDG uptake was evaluated on a semiquantitative scale. RESULTS: The accuracy of (1) H MRS and (18) F-FDG-PET imaging for diagnosis of glioma progression was 75% and 83%, respectively. Classifying the tumors by grade improved accuracy of (18) F-FDG-PET to 100% in high-grade gliomas and accuracy of (1) H MRS to 80% in low-grade tumors. Spearman's analysis demonstrated a trend between (18) F-FDG uptake and tumor grading (rho= .612, P-value = .272). The results of (18) F-FDG-PET and (1) H MRS were concordant in 75% (9/12) of cases. CONCLUSION: The combination of (1) H MRS data and (18) F-FDG-PET imaging can enhance detection of glioma progression. (1) H MRS imaging was more accurate in low-grade gliomas and (18) F-FDG-PET provided better accuracy in high-grade gliomas.

Title: Comparison of (18)F-FET PET and 5-ALA fluorescence in cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare presurgical (18)F-fluoroethyl-L: -tyrosine ((18)F-FET) uptake and Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) enhancement on MRI (Gd) with intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence in cerebral gliomas. METHODS: (18)F-FET positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 30 patients with brain lesions suggestive of diffuse WHO grade II or III gliomas on MRI. PET and MRI data were coregistered to guide neuronavigated biopsies before resection. After oral application of 5-ALA, 38 neuronavigated biopsies were taken from predefined tumour areas that were positive or negative for (18)F-FET or Gd and checked for 5-ALA fluorescence. (18)F-FET uptake with a mean tumour to brain ratio >/=1.6 was rated as positive. RESULTS: Of 38 biopsies, 21 corresponded to high-grade glioma tissue (HGG) of WHO grade III (n = 19) or IV (n = 2) and 17 biopsies to low-grade glioma tissue (LGG) of WHO grade II. In biopsies corresponding to HGG, (18)F-FET PET was positive in 86% (18/21), but 5-ALA and Gd in only 57% (12/21). A mismatch between Gd and 5-ALA was observed in 6 of 21 cases of HGG biopsy samples (3 Gd-positive/5-ALA-negative and 3 Gd-negative/5-ALA-positive). In biopsies corresponding to LGG, (18)F-FET was positive in 41% (7/17), while 5-ALA and Gd were negative in all but one instance. All tumour areas with 5-ALA fluorescence were positive on (18)F-FET PET. CONCLUSION: There are differences between (18)F-FET and 5-ALA uptake in cerebral gliomas owing to a limited sensitivity of 5-ALA to detect tumour tissue especially in LGG. (18)F-FET PET is more sensitive to detect glioma tissue than 5-ALA fluorescence and should be considered as an additional tool in resection planning.

Title: Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/CT for recurrence diagnosis in high-grade malignant glioma (grades III and IV): Executive summary of final report D06-01D, Version 1.0.
Abstract: The present investigation followed 2 aims: 1. Determination of the patient-relevant benefit of PET and PET/CT. The primary aim of this report was to describe the patient-relevant benefit that doctors and patients can expect from imaging methods with PET and PET/CT in the recurrence diagnosis of highly malignant glioma. "Benefit" was understood here to mean changes that are causally attributed to the use of PET and have perceptible consequences for the patient. 2. Assessment of the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of PET and PET/CT. If too few informative trials to determine the patient-relevant benefit (first goal) were identified, a systematic assessment of the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of PET and PET/CT was also to be carried out (second goal). In this context it was to be examined to what extent PET and PET/CT are superior to standard diagnostic procedures without PET. In other words, does the use of PET and PET/CT improve the rate of correct diagnoses or of the correct exclusion of recurrences? Similarly, does the use of PET and PET/CT enable more reliable prognostic statements on the occurrence of a recurrence than is possible with existing standard diagnostic procedures?

Title: Prognostic significance of parameters derived from co-registered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and contrast-enhanced MRI in patients with high-grade glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of the volume and intensity of abnormal (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) accumulation within areas of contrast enhancement on post-therapeutic volumetric MRI. METHODS: A total of 10 patients with Grade III or IV glioma were treated with resection followed by intracavitary radiation therapy with (131)I-labelled antitenascin monoclonal antibody. Patients underwent serial FDG-PET and 1.5 T MR imaging. For each patient, MR and FDG-PET image volumes at each time point were aligned using a rigid-body normalised mutual information algorithm. Contrast-enhancing regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a semi-automated k-means clustering technique. Activity within the ROI on the co-registered PET scan was calculated as a ratio (mean activity ratio; MAR) to activity in contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). The PET lesion was defined as the portion of the ROI associated with activity greater than two standard deviations above the mean in NAWM. Survival was assessed using the logrank test. RESULTS: Larger contrast-enhancing ROIs were strongly associated with an increased MAR (r = 0.51; p<0.002). Enhancing lesions with an MAR >1.2 were associated with decreased survival (p<0.016). In nine patients who died, the MAR on PET correlated inversely with survival duration (r = -0.43; p<0.01), whereas PET lesion volume did not. CONCLUSION: Following intracavitary radiation therapy, the development of contrast-enhancing lesions that are associated with high mean FDG-PET accumulation suggests poor prognosis.

Title: Biopsy targeting gliomas: do functional imaging techniques identify similar target areas?
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Because of the heterogeneous nature of glioma, biopsies performed should be targeted at the most anaplastic region. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) techniques have been proposed for identifying the most anaplastic tumor area. However, it is unclear whether the recommended biopsy targets based on these various functional imaging modalities correspond with each other. Thus, the purpose was to evaluate whether they identify similar target areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients with suspected glioma were assessed within 2.3 +/- 3.5 days by MRI, 18F-fluorothymidine-, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Thirty-five patients underwent gross total resection and 26 were stereotactically biopsied. MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla broadband transmit/receive system, using a double-resonant birdcage coil. The MRI protocol comprised of sodium (23Na)-MRI (3D-radial projection imaging), proton spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI, point-resolved spectroscopy), arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and dynamic-susceptibility-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI after a single dose each of gadobenate dimeglumine. Also, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were processed from diffusion tensor images. Image analysis comprised a detailed semiquantitative region of interest analysis of the different parameter values as well as visual identification of the most conspicuous tumor areas on parameter maps, for example, areas with maximum tumor perfusion, highest metabolite ratios of choline-containing compounds/N-acetyl-aspartate, or lowest ADC values within tumor tissue. Colocalization of these areas was then assessed. RESULTS: Regarding tumor vascularity-related parameters and tumor proliferation-related parameters, the higher the glioma grade the higher were the respective parameters in semiquantitative analysis. ADC values decreased with glioma grade. In the whole study population comprising low- (N = 15) and high-grade gliomas (N = 42), except for 23Na-MRI, there was good (>50%) or perfect (100%) agreement of the tumor areas with highest values on parameter images in the majority of cases (>80%), that is, tumor areas with increased thymidine-uptake and highest choline, both suggestive of increased tumor proliferation, and elevated microcirculation as demonstrated by DSC-, arterial spin-labeling-, and DCE-MRI. 23Na-MRI depicted the highest signal within necrotic tumor areas, but non-necrotic gliomas also showed a perfect agreement in more than 61%. 18F-fluorothymidine-PET, DSC-, and DCE-MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging as well as MR spectroscopic imaging correctly detected no glioma heterogeneity in all 15 histologically proven grade II gliomas but identified suspicious areas in all 3 nonenhancing grade III gliomas. CONCLUSION: Both imaging techniques that depict microcirculation and techniques that visualize proliferation identify similar target areas.

Title: The use of FDG-PET to target tumors by radiotherapy.
Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) plays an increasingly important role in radiotherapy, beyond staging and selection of patients. Especially for non-small cell lung cancer, FDG-PET has, in the majority of the patients, led to the safe decrease of radiotherapy volumes, enabling radiation dose escalation and, experimentally, redistribution of radiation doses within the tumor. In limited-disease small cell lung cancer, the role of FDG-PET is emerging. For primary brain tumors, PET based on amino acid tracers is currently the best choice, including high-grade glioma. This is especially true for low-grade gliomas, where most data are available for the use of (11)C-MET (methionine) in radiation treatment planning. For esophageal cancer, the main advantage of FDG-PET is the detection of otherwise unrecognized lymph node metastases. In Hodgkin's disease, FDG-PET is essential for involved-node irradiation and leads to decreased irradiation volumes while also decreasing geographic miss. FDG-PET's major role in the treatment of cervical cancer with radiation lies in the detection of para-aortic nodes that can be encompassed in radiation fields. Besides for staging purposes, FDG-PET is not recommended for routine radiotherapy delineation purposes. It should be emphasized that using PET is only safe when adhering to strictly standardized protocols.

Title: Advanced MRI and PET imaging for assessment of treatment response in patients with gliomas.
Abstract: Imaging techniques are important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up of patients with gliomas. T1-weighted MRI, with or without gadolinium, is the gold standard method. However, this technique only reflects biological activity of the tumour indirectly by detecting the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, especially for low-grade glioma or after treatment, T1-weighted MRI enhanced with gadolinium has substantial limitations. Development of more advanced imaging methods to improve outcomes for individual patients is needed. New imaging methods based on MRI and PET can be employed in various stages of disease to target the biological activity of the tumour cells (eg, increased uptake of aminoacids or nucleoside analogues), the changes in diffusivity through the interstitial space (diffusion-weighted MRI), the tumour-induced neovascularisation (perfusion-weighted MRI or contrast-enhanced MRI, or increased uptake of aminoacids in endothelial wall), and the changes in concentrations of metabolites (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). These techniques have advantages and disadvantages, and should be used in conjunction to best help individual patients. Advanced imaging techniques need to be validated in clinical trials to ensure standardisation and evidence-based implementation in routine clinical practice.

Title: Imaging and response criteria in gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the most recent advances in the imaging of gliomas with a focus on high-grade gliomas. In the last several years, MRI and PET imaging of the brain have moved beyond anatomic imaging and are now capable of probing different aspects of tumor biology and response to treatment. These new techniques are increasingly being incorporated into clinical trials and even into clinical practice. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with the available imaging techniques and their potential uses versus limitations. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2010, updated response assessment criteria for high-grade gliomas were published. It was the first revision to imaging response criteria for gliomas since 1990 and represents an international effort to standardize criteria for clinical trials. Although this revision represents an important development, there are several promising imaging techniques on the horizon such as vascular permeability measurement, perfusion imaging, diffusion imaging, and new PET tracers that will continue to improve our understanding of tumor biology. SUMMARY: Advances in neuroimaging of brain tumors are enabling investigators to noninvasively visualize tumor response to treatment over time. As these tools are validated, they will add substantially to our ability to understand glioma biology and response to therapy.

Title: Prospective study of p-[123I]iodo-L-phenylalanine and SPECT for the evaluation of newly diagnosed cerebral lesions: specific confirmation of glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The differentiation between gliomas, metastases and gliotic or inflammatory lesions by imaging techniques remains a challenge. Gliomas frequently exhibit increased uptake of radiolabelled amino acids and are thus amenable to PET or SPECT imaging. Recently, p-[123I]iodo-L-phenylalanine (IPA) was validated for the visualization of glioma by SPECT and received orphan drug status. Here we investigated its diagnostic performance for differentiating indeterminate brain lesions. METHODS: This prospective open study included 67 patients with newly diagnosed brain lesions suspicious for glioma (34 without and 33 with contrast enhancement in the MRI scan). Patients received 250 MBq IPA intravenously after overnight fasting. SPECT images at 30 min and 3 h post-injection were iteratively reconstructed and visually interpreted after image fusion with an MRI brain scan (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence or T1-weighted contrast-enhanced image). Findings were correlated with results of stereotactic or open biopsies or serial imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-seven low-grade (2 WHO I, 25 WHO II) and 24 high-grade gliomas (1 WHO III, 23 WHO IV), 3 metastases originating from lung cancer as well as 13 non-neoplastic lesions were proven. All non-neoplastic lesions and all metastases were negative with IPA SPECT. Forty gliomas were true-positive (TP) and 11 false-negative (FN) findings (8 WHO II, 1 WHO III, 2 WHO IV) occurred. There were no false-positive (FP) findings. For the differentiation of primary brain tumours and non-neoplastic lesions, sensitivity and specificity were 78 and 100%. In 34 lesions without contrast enhancement in MRI, IPA SPECT resulted in 17 TP, 8 true-negative, 9 FN and no FP findings (sensitivity 65%, specificity 100%). CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected glioma, IPA SPECT shows a high specificity, but especially in low-grade gliomas FN findings may occur. Due to the high positive predictive value a positive finding allows a suspected glioma to be confirmed.

Title: Hybrid PET/MRI of intracranial masses: initial experiences and comparison to PET/CT.
Abstract: Simultaneous PET and MRI using new hybrid PET/MRI systems promises optimal spatial and temporal coregistration of structural, functional, and molecular image data. In a pilot study of 10 patients with intracranial masses, the feasibility of tumor assessment using a PET/MRI system comprising lutetium oxyorthosilicate scintillators coupled to avalanche photodiodes was evaluated, and quantification accuracy was compared with conventional PET/CT datasets. METHODS: All measurements were performed with a hybrid PET/MRI scanner consisting of a conventional 3-T MRI scanner in combination with an inserted MRI-compatible PET system. Attenuation correction of PET/MR images was computed from MRI datasets. Diagnoses at the time of referral were low-grade astrocytoma (n = 2), suspicion of low-grade astrocytoma (n = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade III; n = 1), glioblastoma (n = 2), atypical neurocytoma (n = 1), and meningioma (n = 3). In the glial tumors, (11)C-methionine was used for PET; in the meningiomas, (68)Ga-DOTATOC was administered. Tumor-to-gray matter and tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated for gliomas, and tracer uptake of meningiomas was referenced to nasal mucosa. PET/MRI was performed directly after clinically indicated PET/CT examination. RESULTS: In all patients, the PET datasets showed similar diagnostic image quality on the hybrid PET/MRI and the PET/CT studies; however, slight streak artifacts were visible in coronal and sagittal sections when using the higher intrinsic resolution of the PET/MRI insert. Prefiltering of images with a 4-mm gaussian filter at a resolution comparable to that of the PET/CT system virtually eliminated these artifacts. Although acquisition of the PET/MR images started at 30-60 min after PET/CT (20.4-min half-life of (11)C) acquisition, the signal-to-noise ratio was good enough, thus underlining the high sensitivity of the PET insert, compared with whole-body PET systems. The computed tumor-to-reference tissue ratios exhibited an excellent accordance between the PET/MRI and PET/CT systems, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98. Mean paired relative error was 7.9% +/- 12.2%. No significant artifacts or distortions were detected in the simultaneously acquired MR images using the PET/MRI scanner. CONCLUSION: Structural, functional, and molecular imaging in patients with brain tumors is feasible with diagnostic imaging quality using simultaneous hybrid PET/MR image acquisition.

Title: [Combined use of positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and (11)C-methionine for preoperative evaluation of gliomas].
Abstract: OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of combined use of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (11)C-methionine (MET) for the preoperative evaluation of gliomas and to investigate the feasibility of PET in glioma surgery. METHODS: Preoperative FDG (n=25) and/or MET (n=22) PET studies were performed in 26 patients with primary and recurrent adult gliomas. We qualitatively (visual analysis) and quantitatively evaluated the uptake of both tracers in the tumor location. For quantitative analysis, data were analyzed by a region of interest method using the standard uptake value (SUV) and a calculated uptake ratio. We investigated the correlation among the tracer uptake ratios, histological tumor grading and tumor proliferation activity. RESULTS: On visual inspection, no patient (0/9) with high uptake of FDG had low grade gliomas and 94% (14/15) had high grade gliomas, while uptake of MET was present in all patients. On quantitative analysis, histological tumor grade was most reflected in FDG uptake ratio compared with contralateral white matter. The tumor/normal brain (T/N) uptake ratio of MET increased stepwise with increasing histological grade but was not significantly different from tumor grade. In comparison of FDG and MET uptake ratio with proliferation activity, a significant correlation was shown for FDG uptake ratio, but not for the T/N ratio of MET. CONCLUSIONS: MET is useful in detecting and delineating the extent of the tumor, but not in evaluating tumor grade and proliferative activity. The FDG uptake ratio correlates well with tumor grade and proliferative activity. Preoperative PET studies with FDG and MET play complementary roles in the planning of glioma surgery, and integrated information from both tracers helps us to plan the extent of tumor resection.

Title: Differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in high-grade gliomas: assessing the efficacy of 18F-FDG PET, 11C-methionine PET and perfusion MRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The authors analyzed the characteristics of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and (11)C-methionine (MET) PET to compare the efficacies of these modalities in making the distinction between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence of high-grade glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were evaluated with dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI, (11)C-MET PET and (18)F-FDG PET to visualize gadolinium-enhanced lesions during the post-radiation follow-up period. In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L(max)/R(max) ratio. RESULTS: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p=0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from the (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET. CONCLUSION: A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.

Title: Continuous low-dose temozolomide and celecoxib in recurrent glioblastoma.
Abstract: Even after gross tumor resection and combined radiochemotherapy, glioblastomas recur within a few months. Salvage therapy often consists of rechallenging with temozolomide in a dose-intensified schedule. Previously, low-dose metronomic temozolomide in combination with cyclo-oxigenase 2 inhibitors has had a beneficial effect as first-line treatment for glioblastoma. We report our experience with this procedure in recurrent glioblastomas after standard treatment. From June 2007 to April 2009, 28 patients with recurrent glioblastoma received continuous low-dose temozolomide of 10 mg/m(2) twice daily and 200 mg celecoxib. Before therapy the recurrent tumor was resected in 19 of 28 patients. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by immunohistochemistry in 19 patients, and MGMT promoter methylation status, using the pyrosequencing method, was determined in 17 patients. In 14/28 patients, positron emission tomography with [F-18]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET-PET) was performed. Tumor progression was defined by the Macdonald criteria on MRI every 8-12 weeks or by clinical deterioration. The median time to progression was 4.2 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) after 6 months was 43%. Except for a lymphopenia in one patient, there was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity. PFS did not correlate with MVD or MGMT status. A high FET uptake correlated with tumor control after 6 months under therapy (P = 0.041, t-test). Low-dose continuous temozolomide in combination with celecoxib seems to have activity in recurrent glioblastoma without relevant toxicity. High FET uptake correlated with a better outcome under metronomic therapy.

Title: Is there a place for FET PET in the initial evaluation of brain lesions with unknown significance?
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the use of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L: -tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients of a neurological clinic for evaluation of brain lesions newly diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We evaluated 88 patients (44 women and 44 men) with a mean age of 50 +/- 19 years who were sent consecutively for evaluation of an intracerebral mass or lesion observed by MRI from 2006 to 2008. Hospitalization was necessary due to neurological clinical symptoms. Images were obtained by PET/CT 30 min after i.v. injection of 185 MBq FET. Coregistration with MRI was done by HERMES workstation. RESULTS: FET uptake above the cortical level was observed in 60 patients. Neurosurgery was performed in 60 patients (51 with FET-positive imaging); 36 high-grade and 19 low-grade tumours were verified histologically. The sensitivity of FET PET for high-grade tumours (WHO III-IV) was 94% in this setting. Among the low-grade brain tumours (WHO I-II) 13 of 19 were FET positive, which indicates a sensitivity of 68%. Five of ten (50%) astrocytomas I and II could not be visualized by FET. Histological data were not provided for 28 of 88 patients, so the diagnostic approach is based upon longitudinal observation. Radiological and/or clinical control was done at a median of 7 months later. Three patients (all FET positive) died a few months after the examination because of rapid progression of the malignant brain tumour. A malignant entity could be excluded in the other 25 patients. Considering the whole cohort of 88 patients, 43 patients with malignant tumour could be identified, including high-grade glioma, intracerebral lymphoma (n = 1) and metastasis (n = 3). The sensitivity of FET PET for detecting a malignant tumour entity was 93%. We observed two false-positive cases with postischaemic lesions. Remarkably, the two patients with cerebral gliomatosis were false-negative on FET PET imaging. The negative predictive value for a malignant entity was calculated to be 89%. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a high sensitivity of FET PET for detecting high-grade glioma in patients with neurological symptoms and recently observed brain lesions by MRI. In the setting of evaluating new brain lesions of unknown significance via FET PET a negative image can encourage a wait and see strategy-of course in accordance with the clinical picture and morphological imaging.

Title: Kinetics of 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine during treatment monitoring of recurrent high-grade glioma.
Abstract: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is used as a biomarker of cell proliferation. We investigated the kinetics of (18)F-FLT during treatment of malignant glioma with bevacizumab and irinotecan. METHODS: Fifteen patients with recurrent high-grade brain tumors (2 grade III, 13 grade IV) were studied at baseline (study 1 [S1]), after 1 course of therapy (2 wk, study 2 [S2]), and at the end of therapy (6 wk, study 3 [S3]). (18)F-FLT (1.5 MBq/kg) was administered intravenously, and dynamic PET was performed for 1 h. Curves representing blood clearance and tumor uptake were derived from factor images and summed frames with thresholding techniques or with a fixed cube. The standard (18)F-FLT model was used to estimate the rate constants. (18)F-FLT uptake was measured at 2 time points (early standardized uptake value [SUV(early)] and late SUV [SUV(late)]). RESULTS: Parameters appeared similar for curves derived from factor images and summed frames; the steepest drop occurred between S1 and S2 for transport, influx, SUV(early), and SUV(late). Three groups were distinguished on the basis of clinical outcome: patients who died within 6 mo (group 1 [G1], n = 4), survived 6-12 mo (group 2 [G2], n = 6), and survived more than 1 y (group 3 [G3], n = 5). None of the rate constants was significantly different between the groups. Long-term survivors (G3) showed a significantly different SUV change (in percentage) between S1 and S3, whereas short-term survivors (G1 and G2) did not. CONCLUSION: Overall, the relative SUV change from S1 to S3 predicted a favorable clinical outcome, whereas the SUV change from S1 to S2 did not. Long-term survivors (G3) showed a significant drop in SUV from S1 to S2 and from S1 to S3. Significant correlations were found between SUV and both the rate constant and the influx rate. The correlation coefficient between SUV(late) and influx rate was 0.91, permitting response monitoring by the measurement of (18)F-FLT uptake changes.

Title: 3'-Deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET in Patients with Suspicious Recurrence of Glioma after Multimodal Treatment: Initial Results of a Retrospective Comparative Study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the uptakes and diagnostic accuracies between 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET in patients with a clinical suspicion of having a recurrence of glioma after multimodality treatment. METHODS: Thirty-two patients who underwent FLT and FET PET due to abnormal enhancement on magnetic resonance (MR) images were included. According to surgical confirmation or follow-up results, patients were divided into those with therapy-related benign changes (TRBCs) and those with recurrence. Recurrences were divided again into initial low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). The uptakes of FLT and FET were compared with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and lesion-to-normal ratio (LNR). The diagnostic accuracies were compared via a receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The LNRs of FLT in recurrences with initial HGG (8.26 +/- 5.02) were significantly higher than those in recurrences with initial LGG (3.43 +/- 2.14) and TRBC (1.81 +/- 0.60). The LNRs of FET in recurrence with initial HGG (2.70 +/- 0.48) and LGG (3.03 +/- 1.32) were significantly higher than those in the TRBC (1.60 +/- 0.47). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of FLT and FET for initial LGG were 0.768 and 0.893, respectively. The AUCs of FLT and FET for initial HGG were 1.000 and 0.964. However, there were no statistical significances. The results for comparing with SUVmax were the same as those with LNR. CONCLUSIONS: Uptakes of FLT were different according to initial grade in patients with recurrent glioma, but those of FET were not. However, there were no statistical significances in the diagnostic accuracies according to initial grade between the two tracers in this study.

Title: Evaluation of O-(2-[18F]-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine in the Diagnosis of Glioblastoma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of synthesis of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET), a new positron emission tomographic (PET) tracer described in several studies but not yet considered standard in management of glioma, in routine practice and to determine FET uptake in a homogeneous group of patients with suspected high-grade glioma. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized trial. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with suspicion of high-grade glioma. RESULTS: The mean (SD) FET uptake ratio was 3.15 (0.72) for the 12 patients and 3.16 (0.75) for the 11 patients with glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: The initial results are promising and indicate that FET PET is a valuable and applicable tool for the imaging of high-grade glioma.

Title: Accumulation of CD133-positive glioma cells after high-dose irradiation by Gamma Knife surgery plus external beam radiation.
Abstract: OBJECT: Recent evidence suggests that a glioma stem cell subpopulation might contribute to radioresistance in malignant gliomas. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors examined recurrent malignant gliomas for histopathological changes after high-dose irradiation with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). METHODS: Thirty-two patients with malignant gliomas (Grade 3 in 8 patients, Grade 4 in 24) underwent GKS in combination with EBRT. Serial MR and L-[methyl-(11)C] methionine PET images were employed to assess remnant or recurrent tumors after GKS. Twelve patients underwent surgical removal after GKS and EBRT. Histological sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry for MIB-1, factor VIII, and stem cell markers, nestin and CD133. RESULTS: The site of GKS treatment failure was local in 16 (76.2%) of 21 patients with glioblastomas showing progression; in 9 of these 16 patients, the recurrence clearly arose within the target lesion of GKS. Histopathological examination after GKS and EBRT showed variable mixtures of viable tumor tissues and necrosis. Viable tumor tissues exhibited high MIB-1 indices but reduced numbers of tumor blood vessels. There was marked accumulation of CD133-positive glioma cells, particularly in remnant tumors within the necrotic areas, in sections obtained after GKS plus EBRT, whereas CD133-positive cells appeared very infrequently in primary sections prior to adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CD133-positive glioma stemlike cells can survive high-dose irradiation, leading to recurrence, despite prolonged damage to tumor blood vessels. This could be an essential factor limiting the effectiveness of GKS plus EBRT for malignant gliomas.

Title: Utility of positron emission tomography for tumour surveillance in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.
Abstract: PURPOSE: There is little consensus regarding optimal surveillance of optic pathway glioma (OPG) and plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) in childhood neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). (18)F-2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) is employed in the surveillance of adult PNFs; but its utility has neither been specifically studied in children with PNFs nor in children with OPG. METHODS: Review of PET/CT studies was performed in NF1 children with OPG or PNF. FDG-avidity of tumours was semi-quantitatively analysed and graded by calculating the maximum standardised uptake value (SUV(max)) [grade 1: <3 (low), grade 2: >3-<4 (intermediate), grade 3: >4 (intense)]. RESULTS: Eighteen children (ten girls; median age: 8.5-years) had PET/CT. Nineteen OPGs were imaged. The SUV(max) could be measured in 16. Ten were grade 1 and three each were grade 2 and grade 3. FDG-avidity reduced from grade 3 to grade 1 in two symptomatic OPGs following chemotherapy and this was associated with clinical improvement. PET/CT diagnosed symptomatic OPGs with a sensitivity of 0.625 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.259-0.897] and specificity of 0.875 (95% CI: 0.466-0.993). Sixteen PNFs were imaged. Twelve were grade 1 and two each were grade 2 and grade 3. The two grade 3 PNFs were confirmed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. PET/CT diagnosed malignant transformation with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.197-1.0) and specificity of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.561-0.974). CONCLUSION: PET/CT may contribute useful information to the surveillance of OPG in childhood NF1-particularly to identify progressive, symptomatic tumours. As in adults, PET/CT is useful for the detection of malignant transformation in PNFs in children with NF1.

Title: Response of recurrent high-grade glioma to treatment with (90)Y-DOTATOC.
Abstract: The treatment of patients with high-grade malignant glioma still represents an unsolved clinical problem. We report the treatment of 3 patients who had World Health Organization grade IV recurrent glioblastoma: a 23-y-old woman and 2 men aged 61 and 62 y. METHODS: All 3 patients were treated with the somatostatin receptor radiopharmaceutical (90)Y-labeled [1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid(0)-d-Phe(1),Tyr(3)]octreotide (DOTATOC). A cumulated dose of 1.7-2.2 GBq given in 3 or 4 cycles was locally injected into a previously implanted catheter system. RESULTS: Treatment was successful in all 3 patients, with only minor side effects reported. After treatment, MRI and PET showed complete remission in one patient and partial remission in the other patients. These findings correlated well with clinical improvement and improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: Receptor-mediated radionuclide therapy by locally injected (90)Y-DOTATOC is feasible and well tolerated. This approach represents an attractive strategy for the treatment of locally recurring or progressing glioblastoma.

Title: 5-Aminolevulinic acid is a promising marker for detection of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Because of intratumoral heterogeneity, diffusely infiltrating gliomas that lack significant contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging are prone to tissue sampling error. Subsequent histologic undergrading may delay adjuvant treatments. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant glioma tissue, and is currently used for resection of malignant gliomas. The aim of this study was to clarify whether 5-ALA might serve as marker for visualization of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement for precise intraoperative tissue sampling. METHODS: 5-ALA was administered in 17 patients with diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement. During glioma resection, positive fluorescence was noted by a modified neurosurgical microscope. Intraoperative topographic correlation of focal 5-ALA fluorescence with maximum (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography uptake (PET(max)) was performed. Multiple tissue samples were taken from areas of positive and/or negative 5-ALA fluorescence. Histopathological diagnosis was established according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2007 criteria. Cell proliferation was assessed for multiregional samples by MIB-1 labeling index (LI). RESULTS: Focal 5-ALA fluorescence was observed in 8 of 9 patients with WHO grade III diffusely infiltrating gliomas. All 8 of 8 WHO grade II diffusely infiltrating gliomas were 5-ALA negative. Focal 5-ALA fluorescence correlated topographically with PET(max) in all patients. MIB-1 LI was significantly higher in 5-ALA-positive than in nonfluorescent areas within a given tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that 5-ALA is a promising marker for intraoperative visualization of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement. Unaffected by intraoperative brain shift, 5-ALA may increase the precision of tissue sampling during tumor resection for histopathological grading, and therefore optimize allocation of patients to adjuvant treatments.

Title: Correlation of L-methyl-11C-methionine (MET) uptake with L-type amino acid transporter 1 in human gliomas.
Abstract: L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a neutral amino acid transport system and is a major route for the transport of large neutral amino acids, including methionine, through the plasma membrane. LAT1 requires the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) for its functional expression. Positron emission tomography (PET) with L-[methyl-(11)C] methionine (MET) provides information about amino acid metabolism in brain tumors. We conducted a clinicopathologic study to elucidate the correlation of LAT1 and 4F2hc expression with MET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed human gliomas. Thirty-three newly diagnosed glioma patients were enrolled in this study. Uptake of MET in the tumor was evaluated with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Expression of the LAT1, 4F2hc, and CD34, and Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and the correlation with the SUVmax in the tumors was examined. Expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc was higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. The grade of LAT1 immunostaining increased with glioma grade. LAT1 was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and vascular endothelium and 4F2hc was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Expression of LAT1 but not 4F2hc was significantly correlated with MET SUVmax. Expression of LAT1 in the tumor vascular endothelium is significantly correlated with CD34 positive microvessel density. In conclusion, MET SUVmax correlates with LAT1 expression in the tumor in newly diagnosed gliomas. MET transport may be increased by an increased number of microvessels combined with a higher density or activity of LAT1 in the tumor endothelial cells in high-grade gliomas. Use of MET-PET as a molecular target combined with anti-angiogenesis in glioma therapy should be addressed in future studies.

Title: Glioma recurrence versus radiation necrosis? A pilot comparison of arterial spin-labeled, dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced MRI, and FDG-PET imaging.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing recurrent glial tumor from radiation necrosis can be challenging. The purpose of this pilot study was to preliminarily compare unenhanced arterial spin-labeled (ASL) imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume (DSCE-CBV) magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging in distinguishing predominant glioma recurrence or progression from predominant radiation necrosis in postoperative patients treated with proton-beam therapy. METHODS: Patients with grade II to IV glioma previously treated with surgery and proton-beam therapy were enrolled on the basis of new enhancing nodules or masses with primary differential diagnoses of predominant tumor recurrence or progression versus radiation necrosis. ASL, DSCE-CBV, and PET examinations were assessed by visual qualitative and quantitative analysis for the detection of predominant tumor recurrence. Imaging results were correlated with a clinical-pathologic reference standard. RESULTS: Thirty patients were studied, resulting in 33 ASL, 32 DSCE-CBV, and 26 PET examinations. On the basis of visual inspection, the sensitivities of PET, ASL, and DSCE-CBV examinations for detecting high-grade tumor foci were 81%, 88%, and 86%, respectively. The highest sensitivity values for quantitative ASL imaging were obtained using a normalized cutoff ratio of 1.3, resulting in sensitivity of 94% for ASL imaging and 71% for DSCE-CBV imaging. When predominant high-grade tumors with superimposed regions of predominant mixed radiation necrosis were excluded, DSCE-CBV sensitivity improved to 90%, but ASL sensitivity remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DSCE-CBV imaging, ASL imaging may more accurately distinguish predominant recurrent high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis, especially in regions with mixed radiation necrosis, for which DSCE-CBV imaging may underestimate true blood volume because of leakage artifacts.

Title: Comparative PET study using F-18 FET and F-18 FDG for the evaluation of patients with suspected brain tumour.
Abstract: The aim of this prospective pilot study in patients with suspected or known brain tumour was to establish the diagnostic value of O-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET) when compared to fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Twenty-five FET PET and FDG PET scans were performed on 21 consecutive patients within 24 months. Final malignant pathology included 11 glioma (eight low-grade, three high grade), two lymphoma, one olfactory ganglioneuroblastoma, one anaplastic meningioma. Benign pathology included two encephalitis and one cortical dysplasia. Definitive pathology was not available in three patients. The accuracy of PET was determined by subsequent surgical histopathology in 12 and clinical/imaging course in nine patients. Median follow-up period was 20 months. FET sensitivity was 93%, specificity 100%, accuracy 96%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) 91%. FDG sensitivity was 27%, specificity 90%, accuracy 52%, PPV 80% and NPV 45%. FET PET is more accurate than FDG PET for detecting malignant brain lesions, especially low-grade gliomas.

Title: Relative value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance perfusion, and 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography for detection of recurrence or grade increase in gliomas.
Abstract: In a consecutive series of 26 previously operated patients diagnosed with cerebral glioma, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 2-((18)F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and perfusion MRI (MRP), were performed at follow-up to distinguish recurrence from radiation necrosis, and to identify tumour upgrading. Discrepancy between techniques was observed in 9 cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of each technique to detect the presence of high grade glioma was: MRI, PPV=50%; MRS, PPV=91.6%, NPV=100%; FDG-PET, PPV=75%, NPV=61.1%; MRP, PPV=100%, NPV=100%. In the selected group of nine cases studied to differentiate viable tumour from radiation necrosis, MRS and MRP reached a PPV and a NPV of 100%, whereas for FDG-PET, PPV and NPV were 66.6% and 60%, respectively. To distinguish between viable high-grade glioma and radiation necrosis, gadolinium-enhanced MRI gives a high false-positive rate, while MRS and MRP are superior to FDG-PET in discriminating tumour recurrence, grade increase and radiation necrosis.

Title: Methyl-L-11C-methionine PET as a diagnostic marker for malignant progression in patients with glioma.
Abstract: Methyl-L-(11)C-methionine ((11)C-MET) PET has been shown to detect brain tumors with a high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we investigated the potential of (11)C-MET PET to noninvasively detect tumor progression in patients with gliomas. Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between changes in (11)C-MET uptake on PET and changes in various molecular immunohistochemical markers during progression of gliomas. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with histologically proven glioma were investigated repeatedly with (11)C-MET PET. (11)C-MET uptake was determined for a circular region of interest. Histologic and molecular analyses for tumor progression were performed after open surgery and stereotactic biopsy, respectively. RESULTS: In patients with malignant progression, the mean increase in (11)C-MET uptake was 54.4% (SD, 45.5%; range, 3.1%-162.2%), whereas in patients without a change in tumor grade, mean (11)C-MET uptake did not significantly change (3.9%; SD, 13.7%; range, -24.4% to 26.3%). The difference in the change in (11)C-MET uptake between the group with malignant progression and the group without malignant progression was highly significant (P < 0.001). Receiver-operating-curve analysis revealed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 92.3% for the detection of malignant transformation by an increase in (11)C-MET uptake of more than 14.6%. Increased (11)C-MET uptake of more than 14.6% was indicative of malignant progression in all but 3 leave-one-out iterations. A detailed immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between changes in (11)C-MET uptake and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that (11)C-MET-PET represents a noninvasive method to detect malignant progression in patients with gliomas. Moreover, the increase in (11)C-MET uptake during malignant progression is reflected by an increase in angiogenesis-promoting markers as vascular endothelial growth factor.

Title: Striatal "function-metabolism" mismatch on F-18 FDG/F-18 FDOPA PET/CT.
Abstract: Decrease in gray matter metabolism following cranial irradiation has been documented, but the functional relevance of this finding has not been documented. This case of "function-metabolism" mismatch in the striatum following radiation for a grade III frontoparietal glioma demonstrates that the down-regulation of glucose metabolism as demonstrated by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography is associated with preservation of presynaptic dopaminergic function by the striatal neurons which was demonstrated on a correlative l-3,4-dihydroxy-6-F-flurophenylalanine (F-18 FDOPA) study. The reversibility of this down-regulation is demonstrated in a follow-up scan further proving that there is no neurodegeneration involved.

Title: Recurrence pattern after [(18)F]fluoroethyltyrosine-positron emission tomography-guided radiotherapy for high-grade glioma: a prospective study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the failure pattern observed after (18)F fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) planning after chemo- and radiotherapy (RT) for high-grade glioma. METHODS: All patients underwent prospectively RT planning using morphological gross tumour volumes (GTVs) and biological tumour volumes (BTVs). The post-treatment recurrence tumour volumes (RTVs) of 10 patients were transferred on their CT planning. First, failure patterns were defined in terms of percentage of RTV located outside the GTV and BTV. Second, the location of the RTV with respect to the delivered dose distribution was assessed using the RTV's DVHs. Recurrences with >95% of their volume within 95% isodose line were considered as central recurrences. Finally, the relationship between survival and GTV/BTV mismatches was assessed. RESULTS: The median percentages of RTV outside the GTV and BTV were 41.8% (range, 10.5-92.4) and 62.8% (range, 34.2-81.1), respectively. The majority of recurrences (90%) were centrally located. Using a composite target volume planning formalism, the degree of GTV and BTV mismatch did not correlate with survivorship. CONCLUSIONS: The observed failure pattern after FET-PET planning and chemo-RT is primarily central. The target mismatch-survival data suggest that using FET-PET planning may counteract the possibility of BTV-related progression, which may have a detrimental effect on survival.

Title: Comparison of (18)F-FET and (18)F-FDG PET in brain tumors.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) in patients with brain lesions suspicious of cerebral gliomas. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with suspicion of cerebral glioma were included in this study. From 30 to 50 min after injection of 180 MBq (18)F-FET, a first PET scan ((18)F-FET scan) was performed. Thereafter, 240 MBq (18)F-FDG was injected and a second PET scan was acquired from 30 to 60 min after the second injection ((18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan). The cerebral accumulation of (18)F-FDG was calculated by decay corrected subtraction of the (18)F-FET scan from the (18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan. Tracer uptake was evaluated by visual scoring and by lesion-to-background (L/B) ratios. The imaging results were compared with the histological results and prognosis. RESULTS: Histology revealed 24 low-grade gliomas (LGG) of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II and 19 high-grade gliomas (HGG) of WHO Grade III or IV, as well as nine others, mainly benign histologies. The gliomas showed increased (18)F-FET uptake (>normal brain) in 86% and increased (18)F-FDG uptake (>white matter) in 35%. (18)F-FET PET provided diagnostically useful delineation of tumor extent while this was impractical with (18)F-FDG due to high tracer uptake in the gray matter. A local maximum in the tumor area for biopsy guidance could be identified with (18)F-FET in 76% and with (18)F-FDG in 28%. The L/B ratios showed significant differences between LGG and HGG for both tracers but considerable overlap so that reliable preoperative grading was not possible. A significant correlation of tracer uptake with overall survival was found with (18)F-FDG only. In some benign lesions like abscesses, increased uptake was observed for both tracers indicating a limited specificity of both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FET PET is superior to (18)F-FDG for biopsy guidance and treatment planning of cerebral gliomas. The uptake of (18)F-FDG is associated with prognosis, but the predictive value is limited and a histological evaluation of tumor tissue remains necessary. Therefore, amino acids like (18)F-FET are the preferred PET tracers for the clinical management of cerebral gliomas.

Title: Noninvasive quantification of 18F-FLT human brain PET for the assessment of tumour proliferation in patients with high-grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Compartmental modelling of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) PET-derived kinetics provides a method for noninvasive assessment of the proliferation rate of gliomas. Such analyses, however, require an input function generally derived by serial blood sampling and counting. In the current study, 18F-FLT kinetic parameters obtained from image-derived input functions were compared with those from input functions derived from arterialized blood samples. METHODS: Based on the analysis of 11 patients with glioma (WHO grade II-IV) a procedure for the automated extraction of an input function from 18F-FLT brain PET data was derived. The time-activity curve of the volume of interest with the maximum difference in 18F-FLT uptake during the first 5 min after injection and the period from 60 to 90 min was corrected for partial-volume effects and in vivo metabolism of 18F-FLT. For each patient a two-compartment kinetic model was applied to the tumour tissue using the image-derived input function. The resulting kinetic rate constants K1 (transport across the blood-brain barrier) and Ki (metabolic rate constant or net influx constant) were compared with those obtained from the same data using the input function derived from blood samples. Additionally, the metabolic rate constant was correlated with the frequency of tumour cells stained with Ki-67, a widely used immunohistochemical marker of cell proliferation. RESULTS: The rate constants from kinetic modelling were comparable when the blood sample-derived input functions were replaced by the image-derived functions (K1,img and K1,sample, r = 0.95, p < 10(-5); Ki,img and Ki,sample, r = 0.86, p < 0.001). A paired t-test showed no significant differences in the parameters derived with the two methods (K1,img and K1,sample, p = 0.20; Ki,img and Ki,sample, p = 0.92). Furthermore, a significant correlation between Ki,img and the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was observed (r = 0.73, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Kinetic modelling of 18F-FLT brain PET data using image-derived input functions extracted from human brain PET data with the practical procedure described here provides information about the proliferative activity of brain tumours which might have clinical relevance especially for monitoring of therapy response in future clinical trials.

Title: Association of F18-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosin uptake and 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence in gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Malignant gliomas are highly infiltrative tumours with a fatal prognosis. F18-fluoroethyl-tyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomography (PET) often reveals a broader extension of these tumours compared with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete resection of the contrast-enhancing lesion is aspired. Fluorescence-guided resection using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) improved the extent of resection. In this study, we investigated whether the FET uptake correlates with the extent of resection using 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. METHODS: Thirteen patients who underwent preoperative and postoperative MRI, FET-PET and fluorescence-guided neuronavigated resection were included in this study. The areas in which intraoperative fluorescence terminated the resection were marked. After fusion of PET and MRI, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FET related to normal brain (SUV(R)) was measured in regions of interest corresponding to resected and remaining tissue, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the optimal threshold of the relative SUV anticipating 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. RESULTS: During resection a vivid fluorescence was present in all patients. Histology revealed glioblastomas in 11 cases, an anaplastic astrocytoma in one case and a low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The median FET SUV(R) was higher in areas corresponding to the fluorescent tumour compared with the non-fluorescent normal brain (2.321 vs 1.142, p < 0.0001, t-test). A SUV(R) greater than 1.374 predicted the fluorescence with a sensitivity of 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.94] and a specificity of 0.94 (CI: 0.84-0.99). The area under the ROC curve was 0.9656 (CI: 0.9364-0.9948). CONCLUSIONS: FET uptake predicts the 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in glioma patients. Thus, FET-PET provides useful information for planning glioma resection.

Title: [Use of 11F-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography in brain tumor].
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluoro-'thymidine (FLT) provides information on cellular proliferation activity and has been used in malignant brain tumors. FLT-PET is sensitive in detecting malignant glioma due to the very low background uptake in the normal brain tissue. However, the ability to detect low grade glioma and tumor extension appears to be lower for FLT than for methionine (MET). Recent studies have found a correlation between WHO tumor grade and FLT uptake in gliomas. Our recent experience demonstrated a significant difference in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of FLT between grade II (0.27 +/- 0.06, n=6) and grade IV (2.18 +/- 0.93, n=10) glioma (P < 0.0001), and grade III (0.70 +/- 0.45, n=7) and grade IV glioma (P < 0.001). FLT uptake correlated significantly better with the Ki-67 index (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001) than did MET uptake in gliomas. Studies have also reported the use of FLT-PET to investigate the effectiveness of therapy and prognosis of glioma. Increased FLT accumulation is also observed in other brain tumors including malignant lymphoma and metastatic brain tumor. Further studies are necessary to validate the usefulness of FLT-PET in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.

Title: Substitution of 11C-methionine PET by perfusion MRI during the follow-up of treated high-grade gliomas: preliminary results in clinical practice.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Our aim was to compare perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using carbon-11 labelled methionine (MET) in gliomas and their value in differentiating tumour recurrence from necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 28 patients with a high-grade glioma. A total of 33MR perfusions and MET-PET were ultimately analysable for comparison between the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and MET-PET examinations. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility was assessed and diagnostic value of rCBV compared to MET-PET and histology was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: ROC curve analysis showed that rCBV had at least equal performances in differentiating tumour recurrence and necrosis than MET-PET. Cut-off value of rCBV for differentiating tumour from necrosis was 182% with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, perfusion MRI could replace MET-PET for differentiating necrosis from tumour recurrence.

Title: Diagnostic value of kinetic analysis using dynamic 18F-FDG-PET in patients with malignant primary brain tumor.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of quantitative imaging of glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) using kinetic analysis for differentiating between high-grade glioma and central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. METHODS: Dynamic fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET scans obtained in 20 patients with high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III, five lesions; grade IV, 15 lesions) and in 12 patients with CNS lymphoma (16 lesions) were retrospectively reviewed. Applying a three-compartment model, parametric images of K1, k2, k3, and k4 and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR(Glc)) were obtained. RESULTS: On visual analysis, one grade III glioma lesion showed an increase of K1, k2, and k3 values as observed on their respective images. Four grade IV glioma lesions showed an increase of K1 and k2, 11 of k3, and six of CMR(Glc) on their respective images. Fourteen CNS lymphoma lesions showed an increase of K1, 16 of k3, two of k4, and 14 of CMR(Glc). Both k3 and CMR(Glc) values (mean+/-SD) of CNS lymphoma (0.096+/-0.046 and 77.4+/-37.7, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the normal gray matter (0.059+/-0.015 and 41.3+/-9.3, respectively; P<0.007 and P<0.002, respectively). The k3 value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (0.058+/-0.022) and grade IV (0.065+/-0.024) gliomas (P<0.03 and P<0.04, respectively). The CMR(Glc) value of CNS lymphoma was significantly higher than that of grade III (33.8+/-7.8) and grade IV (41.5+/-23.1) gliomas (P<0.001 and P<0.004, respectively). The value of k2 of CNS lymphoma was significantly lower than that of grade IV glioma (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The direct measurement of the regional rate constants by kinetic analysis might be useful for the delineation of CNS lymphoma and for differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and CNS lymphoma.

Title: Early metabolic responses in temozolomide treated low-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: Amino acid transport and protein synthesis are important steps of tumor growth. We investigated the time course of tumor metabolism in low-grade gliomas (LGG) during temozolomide chemotherapy, and compared metabolic responses as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with volume responses as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MR). A homogeneous population of 11 patients with progressive non-enhancing LGG was prospectively studied. Imaging was done at 6-months intervals starting six months, and in a second series starting three months after treatment initiation. F-18 fluoro-ethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) uptake was quantified with PET as metabolically active tumor volume, and was compared with the tumor volume on MR. Response was defined as >or=10% reduction of the initial tumor volume. Eight patients showed metabolic responses. Already 3 months after start of chemotherapy the active FET volumes decreased in 2 patients to a mean of 44% from baseline. First MR volume responses were noted at 6 months. Responders showed a volume reduction to 31 +/- 23% (mean +/- SD) from baseline for FET, and to 73 +/- 26% for MR. The time to maximal volume reduction was 8.0 +/- 4.4 months for FET, and 15.0 +/- 3.0 months for MR. The initial metabolic response correlated with the best volume response on MR (Spearman Rank P = 0.011). Deactivation of amino acid transport represents an early indicator of chemotherapy response in LGG. Response assessment based on MR only has to be reconsidered. The time window obtained from PET may assist for individual treatment decisions in LGG patients.

Title: Indolent dorsal midbrain tumor: new findings based on positron emission tomography.
Abstract: OBJECT: Intrinsic tumors arising in the dorsal midbrain cause obstructive hydrocephalus and have an indolent clinical course. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and l- [methyl-(11)C]methionine (MET) was used to evaluate the biological behaviors of dorsal midbrain tumors. METHODS: The authors report on 4 patients (3 males and 1 female) with dorsal midbrain tumors who presented with obstructive hydrocephalus. A diagnosis was made with MR imaging in each patient. To manage the hydrocephalus, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed in all cases. The patients did not undergo any other surgical procedures except endoscopic biopsy procedure, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. The patients in 3 cases underwent FDG- and MET-PET within 6 months of CSF-diverting procedures, and the patient in 1 case underwent PET 10 years after the procedure. RESULTS: After the CSF-diverting procedure, clinical symptoms resolved or improved in all patients. Gliosis or glial proliferation was diagnosed in 1 patient, and possible low-grade glioma in 2 patients. Although all tumors appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images, their appearance on T1-weighted images was variable (iso- and/or hypointense), and partial lesion enhancement was observed on images from 2 patients. On the other hand, the PET features of these lesions were almost identical, and the scans did not show a high uptake of FDG and MET compared with the cortical uptake in a normal brain. The mean tumor tissue/normal tissue ratio of FDG uptake was 0.65, and that of MET was 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: Positron emission tomography findings suggested that the indolent dorsal midbrain lesion had nontumorous characteristics, thus supporting a good prognosis. Positron emission tomography studies may be more informative and predictive of the biological behavior of dorsal midbrain tumors than a biopsy procedure.

Title: Positron emission tomography-guided volumetric resection of supratentorial high-grade gliomas: a survival analysis in 66 consecutive patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Integrating positron emission tomographic (PET) images into the image-guided resection of high-grade gliomas (HGG) has shown that metabolic information on tumor heterogeneity and distribution are useful for planning surgery, improve tumor delineation, and provide a final target contour different from that obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone in about 80% of the procedures. Moreover, PET guidance helps to increase the amount of tumor removed and to target image-guided resection to anaplastic tissue areas. The present study aims to evaluate whether PET-guided volumetric resection (VR) in supratentorial HGG might add benefit to the patient's outcome. METHODS: PET images using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (n=23) and [11C]methionine (n=43) were combined with MRI scans in the planning of VR procedures performed at the initial stage in 66 consecutive patients (43 M/23 F) with supratentorial HGG according to the technique previously described. In all cases (35 anaplastic gliomas [20 astrocytomas, 10 oligoastrocytomas, 5 oligodendrogliomas] and 31 glioblastomas [GBM]), level and distribution of PET tracer uptake were analyzed to define a PET contour projected on MRI scans to define a final target contour for VR. Maximal tumor resection was accomplished in each case, with the intention to remove the entire abnormal metabolic area comprised in the surgical planning. Early postoperative MRI and PET assessed tumor resection. Survival analysis was performed separately in anaplastic gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme according to the presence or absence of residual tracer uptake on postoperative PET and according to the presence or absence of residual contrast enhancement on postoperative MRI. RESULTS: Preoperatively, metabolic information helped the surgical planning. In all procedures, PET contributed to define a final target contour different from that obtained with MRI alone. Postoperatively, 46 of 66 patients had no residual PET tracer uptake (total PET resection), 23 of 66 had no residual MRI contrast enhancement. No additional neurological morbidity due to the technique was reported. A total PET tracer uptake resection was associated with a significantly longer survival in anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.0071) and in glioblastoma multiforme (P = 0.0001), respectively. A total MRI contrast enhancement resection was not correlated with a significantly better survival, neither in anaplastic gliomas (P = 0.6089) nor in glioblastoma multiforme (P = 0.6806). CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection of the increased PET tracer uptake prolongs the survival of HGG patients. Because PET information represents a more specific marker than MRI enhancement for detecting anaplastic tumor tissue, PET-guidance increases the amount of anaplastic tissue removed in HGG.

Title: Neurosyphilitic gumma on F18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography: an old disease investigated with a new technology.
Abstract: Neurosyphilitic gumma is a slowly progressive inflammatory manifestation of tertiary syphilis. It is characterised by chronic granulomata that ranges from microscopic lesions to large tumour-like masses. While cutaneous, mucosal and skeletal gummatous lesions are not uncommon, neurosyphilitic gumma is rare. F18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been used effectively to assess the metabolic nature of brain masses, in particular in guiding biopsy and grading gliomas. However, the inflammatory nature of lesions such as neurosyphilitic gumma poses challenges to diagnostic imaging modalities including CT scans, MRI and PET. Since FDG is not a specific tracer for malignancy, neurosyphilitic gumma can mimic a high-grade glioma by demonstrating intense FDG uptake and is therefore a potential diagnostic pitfall. We report a case of neurosyphilitic gumma identified on FDG PET.

Title: [(18)F]Fluoroethyltyrosine- positron emission tomography-guided radiotherapy for high-grade glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To compare morphological gross tumor volumes (GTVs), defined as pre- and postoperative gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to biological tumor volumes (BTVs), defined by the uptake of (18)F fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) for the radiotherapy planning of high-grade glioma, using a dedicated positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scanner equipped with three triangulation lasers for patient positioning. METHODS: Nineteen patients with malignant glioma were included into a prospective protocol using FET PET-CT for radiotherapy planning. To be eligible, patients had to present with residual disease after surgery. Planning was performed using the clinical target volume (CTV = GTV union or logical sum BTV) and planning target volume (PTV = CTV + 20 mm). First, the interrater reliability for BTV delineation was assessed among three observers. Second, the BTV and GTV were quantified and compared. Finally, the geometrical relationships between GTV and BTV were assessed. RESULTS: Interrater agreement for BTV delineation was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.9). Although, BTVs and GTVs were not significantly different (p = 0.9), CTVs (mean 57.8 +/- 30.4 cm(3)) were significantly larger than BTVs (mean 42.1 +/- 24.4 cm(3); p < 0.01) or GTVs (mean 38.7 +/- 25.7 cm(3); p < 0.01). In 13 (68%) and 6 (32%) of 19 patients, FET uptake extended >or= 10 and 20 mm from the margin of the gadolinium enhancement. CONCLUSION: Using FET, the interrater reliability had excellent agreement for BTV delineation. With FET PET-CT planning, the size and geometrical location of GTVs and BTVs differed in a majority of patients.

Title: Contributions of biological tumor parameters to the incorporation rate of L: -[methyl-(11)C] methionine into astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
Abstract: We compared the tumor uptake of (11)C-methionine (MET) with positron emission tomography (PET) with the results of a pathological analysis to examine the proliferative potential and microvessel density measured with immunostaining for MIB-1 and factor VIII, respectively, from 33 patients with glioma. The MET uptake in oligodendrogliomas was significantly greater than that in grade 2 astrocytomas and comparable to those in grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas. The MIB-1 index of oligodendroglioma meanwhile was comparable to that of grade 2 astrocytoma. The microvessel area in oligodendroglioma was significantly greater than that in grade 2 astrocytomas and comparable to those in grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas. According to a multivariate statistical analysis, MET uptake ratio was closely correlated with the MIB-1 index among astrocytomas. An increase in the microvessel area in the oligodendrogliomas contributed to the higher MET uptake among the tumors with a low-proliferative index. This information is important for interpreting the results of MET-PET studies for clinical use.

Title: Differentiation between malignant transformation and tumour recurrence by (68)Ga-bombesin and (18)F-FDG-PET, in patients with low grade gliomas.
Abstract: Treatment of gliomas is multimodal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the posttreatment course is of limited value due to therapy-induced changes. In low-grade gliomas (LGG) malignant transformation is of special interest. Our patients and methods were as follows: In nine consecutive patients with LGG we examined the role of bombesin labelled with gallium-68 ((68)Ga-bombesin) studied with positron emission tomography (PET), in addition to fluoro-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in the differential diagnosis of tumour recurrence versus malignant transformation. We used (68)Ga-bombesin combined with (18)F-FDG-PET in these patients with suspicious new contrast enhancement at the original tumour site or resection cavity in MRI. Eight patients were operated. In one patient, tumour recurrence was most likely as shown by the PET findings and chemotherapy was administered. Our results have shown that in this last mentioned patient after the follow-up period, MRI contrast enhancement was definitively regressive. In the operated patients the tumour was graded as glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma and WHO grade III tumour. In two patients histological grading confirmed the PET findings without malignant transformation. In all of the 9 patients the combination of (68)Ga-bombesin and (18)F-FDG-PET predicted correctly malignant transformation or recurrence of the initial tumour grade which shows that (68)Ga-bombesin-PET can provide additional important information to detect a malignant transformation. In conclusion it is crucial for the patient to differentiate the nature of the new lesion in order to endorse an aggressive or non-aggressive treatment.

Title: Imaging regional variation of cellular proliferation in gliomas using 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron-emission tomography: an image-guided biopsy study.
Abstract: AIM: To compare regional variations in uptake of 3'-deoxy-3'- [(18)F]-fluorothymidine (FLT) images using positron-emission tomography (PET) with measures of cellular proliferation from biopsy specimens obtained by image-guided brain biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with a supratentorial glioma that required an image-guided brain biopsy were imaged preoperatively with dynamic PET after the administration of FLT. Maps of FLT irreversible uptake rate (K(i)) and standardized uptake value (SUV) were calculated. These maps were co-registered to a gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence that was used for biopsy guidance, and the mean and maximum K(i) and SUV determined for each biopsy site. These values were correlated with the MIB-1 labelling index (a tissue marker of proliferation) from these biopsy sites. RESULTS: A total of 57 biopsy sites were studied. Although all measures correlated with MIB-1 labelling index, K(i)(max) provided the best correlation (Pearson coefficient, r=0.68; p<0.001). In low-grade gliomas the K(i)(mean) (+/-SD) was significantly higher than in normal tissue (3.3+/-1.7x10(-3)ml(plasma)/min/ml(tissue) versus 1.2+/-0.7x10(-3)ml(plasma)/min/ml(tissue); p=0.001). High-grade gliomas showed heterogeneous uptake with a mean K(i) of 7.7+/-4x10(-3)ml(plasma)/min/ml(tissue). A threshold K(i)(mean) of 1.8x10(-3) differentiates between normal tissue and tumour (sensitivity 84%, specificity 88%); however, the latter threshold underestimated the extent of tumour in half the cases. SUV closely agreed with K(i) measurements. CONCLUSION: FLT PET is a useful marker of cellular proliferation that correlates with regional variation in cellular proliferation; however, it is unable to identify the margin of gliomas.

Title: Noninvasive detection of therapeutic cytolytic T cells with 18F-FHBG PET in a patient with glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: A 57-year-old man had been diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma multiforme and was enrolled in a trial of adoptive cellular immunotherapy. The trial involved infusion of ex vivo expanded autologous cytolytic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), genetically engineered to express the interleukin 13 zetakine gene (which encodes a receptor protein that targets these T cells to tumor cells) and the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1 tk) suicide gene, and PET imaging reporter gene. INVESTIGATIONS: MRI, whole-body and brain PET scan with (18)F-radiolabelled 9-[4-fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine ((18)F-FHBG) to detect CTLs that express HSV1 tk, and safety monitoring after injection of (18)F-FHBG. DIAGNOSIS: MRI detected grade III-IV glioblastoma multiforme plus two tumors recurrences that developed after resection of the initial tumor. MANAGEMENT: Surgical resection of primary glioblastoma tumor, enrollment in CTL therapy trial, reresection of glioma recurrences, infusion of approximately 1 x 10(9) CTLs into the site of tumor reresection, and (18)F-FHBG PET scan to detect infused CTLs.

Title: The Use of PET in the Evaluation of Tumors in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
Abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common tumor predisposition disorders. The role of PET for distinguishing tumor from non-malignant processes, detecting and grading tumors, evaluating tumor margins, predicting prognosis, directing biopsy, planning treatment, and evaluating response to therapy has been established for a wide variety of benign and malignant tumors. Children with NF1 are particularly at risk for the development of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system, such as neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and low-grade astrocytomas of the optic pathway and other brain regions. This article reviews the role of PET in the management of these NF1-associated tumors of childhood.

Title: Assessment of various strategies for 18F-FET PET-guided delineation of target volumes in high-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to assess the contribution of (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the delineation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in patients with high-grade gliomas compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients with high-grade gliomas. Seven image segmentation techniques were used to delineate (18)F-FET PET GTVs, and the results were compared to the manual MRI-derived GTV (GTV(MRI)). PET image segmentation techniques included manual delineation of contours (GTV(man)), a 2.5 standardized uptake value (SUV) cutoff (GTV(2.5)), a fixed threshold of 40% and 50% of the maximum signal intensity (GTV(40%) and GTV(50%)), signal-to-background ratio (SBR)-based adaptive thresholding (GTV(SBR)), gradient find (GTV(GF)), and region growing (GTV(RG)). Overlap analysis was also conducted to assess geographic mismatch between the GTVs delineated using the different techniques. RESULTS: Contours defined using GTV(2.5) failed to provide successful delineation technically in three patients (18% of cases) as SUV(max) < 2.5 and clinically in 14 patients (78% of cases). Overall, the majority of GTVs defined on PET-based techniques were usually smaller than GTV(MRI) (67% of cases). Yet, PET detected frequently tumors that are not visible on MRI and added substantially tumor extension outside the GTV(MRI) in six patients (33% of cases). CONCLUSIONS: The selection of the most appropriate (18)F-FET PET-based segmentation algorithm is crucial, since it impacts both the volume and shape of the resulting GTV. The 2.5 SUV isocontour and GF segmentation techniques performed poorly and should not be used for GTV delineation. With adequate setting, the SBR-based PET technique may add considerably to conventional MRI-guided GTV delineation.

Title: No relationship between 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and expression of Glut-1 and -3 and hexokinase I and II in high-grade glioma.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare glucose metabolism, measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET), with the expression of Glut-1 and -3 and hexokinase I (Hex I) and II in high-grade glioma. The retrospective study involved 27 patients with WHO classification grade III and IV glioma, with either newly diagnosed or recurrent tumours. Patients underwent dynamic and static [18F]FDG-PET to glucose metabolic rate (MRGlu) and standardised uptake value (SUV), respectively. Tumour biopsies were obtained and stained using immunohistochemistry for the expression of Glut-1, -3, Hex I and II. Relationships between variables were studied using Spearman's rank correlation test. Results showed that the expression of Glut-1, Glut-3, Hex I and Hex II varied between and within the tumour samples. The mean of MRGlu was 0.2 (range 0.09-0.25) micromol/min/ml and that of SUV was 4.2 (range 3.2-5.2). There were no significant relationships among the tumour expression of any of the proteins studied with either MRGlu or SUV (p>0.21 for all). In conclusion, the lack of relationship between the immunohistochemical expression of Glut-1, -3, Hex I or II and glucose metabolism measured using [18F]FDG-PET in patients with high-grade glioma may be due to the tissue heterogeneity and presence of necrosis in high-grade tumours.

Title: Analysis of 11C-methionine uptake in low-grade gliomas and correlation with proliferative activity.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship of (11)C-methionine (MET) uptake and tumor activity in low-grade gliomas (those meeting the criteria for World Health Organization [WHO] grade II gliomas) remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare MET uptake in low-grade gliomas and to analyze whether MET positron-emission tomography (PET) can estimate tumor viability and provide evidence of malignant transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied glioma metabolic activity in 49 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed grade II gliomas by using MET PET before surgical resection. On MET PET, we measured tumor/normal brain uptake ratio (T/N ratio) in 21 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs), 12 oligodendrogliomas (ODs), and 16 oligoastrocytomas (OAs). We compared MET T/N ratio among these 3 tumors and investigated possible correlation with proliferative activity, as measured by Mib-1 labeling index (LI). RESULTS: MET T/N ratios of DA, OD, and OA were 2.11 +/- 0.87, 3.75 +/- 1.43, and 2.76 +/- 1.27, respectively. The MET T/N ratio of OD was significantly higher than that of DA (P < .005). In comparison of MET T/N ratios with the Mib-1 LI, a significant correlation was shown in DA (r = 0.63; P < .005) but not in OD and OA. CONCLUSION: MET uptake in DAs may be closely associated with tumor viability, which depends on increased amino acid transport by an activated carrier-mediated system. DAs with lower MET uptake were considered more quiescent lesions, whereas DA with higher MET uptake may act more aggressively.

Title: FDG, MET or CHO? The quest for the optimal PET tracer for glioma imaging continues.
Abstract: This Practice Point commentary discusses a study by Kato et al. that assessed the usefulness of three PET tracers--(11)C-methionine (MET), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and (11)C-choline--for the metabolic evaluation of gliomas. The authors measured the ratio of tumor uptake to normal brain uptake (T/N ratio), with the frontal cortex as reference region, and analyzed the correlations between tracer uptake and tumor grade, type, and proliferation activity. Whereas all three tracers showed a similar correlation between the T/N ratio and tumor grade in astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, MET proved to be the most user-friendly marker in all gliomas as it enables the straightforward localization of 'hot lesions' and provides outstanding quantitative metabolic parameters. Here we highlight a few methodological issues arising from Kato et al.'s study and, consequently, we urge the PET community to reach a consensus on an objective approach towards the evaluation of PET tracers in the field of neuro-oncology.

Title: 11C-acetate PET in the evaluation of brain glioma: comparison with 11C-methionine and 18F-FDG-PET.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to retrospectively investigate the usefulness of 11C-acetate (ACE)-positron emission tomography (PET) for evaluation of brain glioma, in comparison with 11C-methionine (MET) and 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). PROCEDURES: Fifteen patients with brain glioma referred to initial diagnosis were examined with ACE, MET, and FDG-PET. Five patients had low-grade gliomas (grade II), three had anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III), and seven had glioblastomas (grade IV). PET results were evaluated by visual and semiquantitative analysis. For semiquantitative analysis, the standardized uptake value (SUV) and tumor to contralateral normal gray matter (T/N) ratio were calculated. The sensitivity for detection of high-grade gliomas was calculated using visual analysis. RESULTS: Sensitivities of ACE, MET, and FDG were 90%, 100%, and 40%, respectively. ACE and MET T/N ratios were significantly higher than that of FDG. ACE and FDG SUV in high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than that in low-grade gliomas. No significant differences were observed using MET. CONCLUSIONS: ACE PET is a potentially useful radiotracer for detecting brain gliomas and differentiating high-grade gliomas.

Title: 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET in patients with newly diagnosed glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to clarify the individual and combined role of L-methyl-(11)C-methionine-positron emission tomography (MET-PET) and 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT)-PET in tumor detection, noninvasive grading, and assessment of the cellular proliferation rate in newly diagnosed histologically verified gliomas of different grades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were investigated with MET-PET before surgery. Eighteen patients were also examined with FLT-PET. MET and FLT uptakes were assessed by standardized uptake value of the tumor showing the maximum uptake (SUV(max)), and the ratio to uptake in the normal brain parenchyma (T/N ratio). All tumors were graded by the WHO grading system using surgical specimens, and the proliferation activity of the tumors were determined by measuring the Ki-67 index obtained by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: On semiquantitative analysis, MET exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity (87.8%) in tumor detection than FLT (83.3%), and both tracers were 100% sensitive for malignant gliomas. Low-grade gliomas that were false negative on MET-PET also were false negative on FLT-PET. Although the difference of MET SUV(max) and T/N ratio between grades II and IV gliomas was statistically significant (P < 0.001), there was a significant overlap of MET uptake in the tumors. The difference of MET SUV(max) and T/N ratio between grades II and III gliomas was not statistically significant. Low-grade gliomas with oligodendroglial components had relatively high MET uptake. The difference of FLT SUV(max) and T/N ratio between grades III and IV gliomas was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Again, the difference of FLT SUV(max) and T/N ratio between grades II and III gliomas was not statistically significant. Grade III gliomas with non-contrast enhancement on MR images had very low FLT uptake. In 18 patients who underwent PET examination with both tracers, a significant but relatively weak correlation was observed between the individual SUV(max) of MET and FLT (r = 0.54, P < 0.05) and T/N ratio of MET and FLT (r = 0.56, P < 0.05). Total FLT uptake in the tumor had a higher correlation (r = 0.89, P < 0.001) with Ki-67 proliferation index than MET uptake (r = 0.49, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PET studies using MET and FLT are useful for tumor detection in newly diagnosed gliomas. However, there is no complimentary information in tumor detection with simultaneous measurements of MET- and FLT-PET in low grade gliomas. FLT-PET seems to be superior than MET-PET in noninvasive tumor grading and assessment of proliferation activity in gliomas of different grades.

Title: 18F-FDOPA PET/MRI fusion in patients with primary/recurrent gliomas: initial experience.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: (18)F-FDOPA PET demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity for gliomas than traditional [(18)F] FDG PET imaging. However, PET provides limited anatomic localization. The purpose of this study was to determine whether (18)F-FDOPA PET/MRI fusion can provide precise anatomic localization of abnormal tracer uptake and how this activity corresponds to MR signal abnormality. METHODS: Two groups of patients were analyzed. Group I consisted of 21 patients who underwent (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI followed by craniotomy for tumor resection. Group II consisted of 70 patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioma that had (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI but lacked additional pathologic follow-up. Fused (18)F-FDOPA PET and MRI images were analyzed for concordance and correlated with histopathologic data. RESULTS: Fusion technology facilitated precise anatomical localization of (18)F-FDOPA activity. In group I, all 21 cases showed pathology-confirmed tumor. Of these, (18)F-FDOPA scans were positive in 9/10 (90%) previously unresected tumors, and 11/11 (100%) of recurrent tumors. Of the 70 patients in group II, concordance between MRI and (18)F-FDOPA was found in 49/54 (90.1%) of patients with sufficient follow-up; in the remaining 16 patients concordance could not be determined due to lack of follow-up. (18)F-FDOPA labeling was comparable in both high- and low-grade gliomas and identified both enhancing and non-enhancing tumor equally well. In some cases, (18)F-FDOPA activity preceded tumor detection on MRI. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDOPA PET/MRI fusion provides precise anatomic localization of tracer uptake and labels enhancing and non-enhancing tumor well. In a small minority of cases, (18)F-FDOPA activity may identify tumor not visible on MRI.

Title: 18F-FDG PET of common enhancing malignant brain tumors.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine whether (18)F-FDG PET can be used to differentiate among common enhancing brain tumors such as lymphoma, high-grade glioma, and metastatic brain tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 34 patients with an enhancing brain tumor on MRI, including seven lymphomas, nine high-grade gliomas, and 18 metastatic tumors. All patients also underwent FDG PET. For PET image analysis, regions of interest were placed over the tumor (T), contralateral cortex (C), and white matter (WM). Average and maximum pixel values were determined at each site. On the basis of these measurements, average and maximum standard uptake values (SUV(avg) and SUV(max)) were calculated, along with activity ratios (T/C(avg), T/WM(avg), T/WM(max), and T/C(max)), and comparisons among lesions were then made. RESULTS: All parameters were significantly higher for lymphoma than for other tumors (p < 0.01). High-grade gliomas showed significantly higher SUV(avg) and SUV(max) than metastatic tumors (p < 0.05). Other parameters did not differ between lesion types. SUV(max) was the most accurate parameter for distinguishing lymphomas. Using an SUV(max) of 15.0 as a cutoff for diagnosing CNS lymphoma, only one high-grade glioma was found as a false-positive (SUV(max), 18.8). CONCLUSION: FDG PET may be useful for differentiating common enhancing malignant brain tumors, particularly lymphoma versus high-grade glioma and metastatic tumor. FDG PET can provide useful information for distinguishing between lymphoma and other malignant enhancing brain tumors and is recommended when differential diagnoses are difficult to narrow using MRI alone.

Title: Results of positron emission tomography guidance and reassessment of the utility of and indications for stereotactic biopsy in children with infiltrative brainstem tumors.
Abstract: OBJECT: Most intrinsic infiltrative brainstem lesions diagnosed in children are gliomas, and these carry a very bad prognosis. Although the utility and risk of stereotactically guided biopsy procedures in intrinsic infiltrative brainstem lesions have been widely questioned, the neuroimaging diagnosis may be inaccurate in approximately 25% of cases, and the consequences of empirical therapy should not be underestimated. Stereotactic biopsy sampling is still performed in many centers, but the reported diagnostic yield ranges from 83 to 96%. The authors integrated positron emission tomography (PET) images into the planning for stereotactic biopsy procedures to direct the biopsy needle's trajectory to hypermetabolic foci of intrinsic infiltrative brainstem lesions. Their aim was to assess the benefit of the technique in terms of target selection and diagnostic yield. METHODS: Twenty children with newly diagnosed intrinsic infiltrative brainstem lesions underwent a PET-guided stereotactic biopsy procedure. The PET tracer was(18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in six cases, (11)C-methionine in eight, and both agents were used in six. A single biopsy target was selected in the area of highest PET tracer uptake in all cases. The PET data were compared with diagnoses and outcome. RESULTS: Use of PET guidance improved target selection and provided tumor diagnosis in all trajectories and in all children (high-grade glioma was diagnosed in 10, low-grade glioma in five, and nonglial tumor in five). The PET-guided trajectories provided a higher diagnostic yield than those guided by magnetic resonance imaging alone, which allowed the sampling to be reduced to a single trajectory. The PET data might also carry a prognostic value that could be useful for oncological management. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the suggestion that PET guidance improves the diagnostic yield of stereotactic biopsy sampling, allows the practitioner to reduce the number of sampling procedures, and might lead to a reassessment of the utility of and indications for stereotactic biopsy in children with intrinsic infiltrative brainstem lesions.

Title: Prognostic value of 18F-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine PET and MRI in small nonspecific incidental brain lesions.
Abstract: Nonspecific incidental brain lesions (NILs) are being detected more frequently because of an increasing number of screening or research MRI scans of the brain, and their natural course is uncertain. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study starting in 1999, we determined the outcomes of patients with incidental, nonenhancing, supratentorial, lobar, and small-volume (<10 mL) lesions, depending on the findings of MRI and PET with the (18)F-labeled amino acid fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET). Patients with seizures, focal neurologic deficits, signs of local or systemic infection or inflammation, known brain disease, or any kind of previous cerebral treatment were excluded. Finally, 21 patients were eligible. MRI was performed in 19 of these patients because of nonspecific symptoms (such as headaches, dizziness, or sudden deafness), whereas 2 patients were healthy volunteers in MRI studies. Clinical follow-up and MRI scans were obtained at 4- to 6-mo intervals, and follow-up ranged from 3 to 8.5 y. Mean lesion-to-brain (L/B) ratios of >or=1.6 on (18)F-FET PET were rated as positive. RESULTS: Four different outcome groups were identified. In group A, 5 NILs regressed or vanished completely. All of these lesions were circumscribed on MRI, and (18)F-FET uptake was negative, with an L/B ratio of 1.2+/-0.2 (mean +/- SD). In group B, 10 NILs were stable, without growth. All of these lesions were circumscribed on MRI, and (18)F-FET uptake was negative (L/B ratio: 1.0+/-0.1). In group C, 2 NILs grew slowly over years, and an astrocytoma of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II was diagnosed after resection in each case. The lesions were circumscribed on MRI, and (18)F-FET uptake was negative (L/B ratios: 0.7 and 1.0). In group D, 4 NILs showed sudden and rapid growth, with clinical deterioration, and a high-grade glioma of WHO grade III or IV was diagnosed after resection in all cases. The lesions were diffuse on MRI, and (18)F-FET uptake was significantly increased (L/B ratio: 2.0+/-0.4) (P<0.01 for group D vs. group A or group B). CONCLUSION: For NILs, a circumscribed growth pattern on MRI and normal or low (18)F-FET uptake on PET are strong predictors for a benign course, with the eventual development of a low-grade glioma. In contrast, NILs with a diffuse growth pattern on MRI and increased (18)F-FET uptake indicate a high risk for the development of a high-grade glioma.

Title: Glioma proliferation as assessed by 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine positron emission tomography in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the in vivo derived kinetic parameters of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) and the proliferation rate measured in vitro by Ki-67 staining in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirteen patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas were investigated with (18)F-FLT and methyl-(11)C- l-methionine ((11)C-MET) positron emission tomography (PET) and T1-, Gd-T1-, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on consecutive days. Tracer kinetic parameters of (18)F-FLT as well as the standardized uptake value and the tumor-to-background (T/B) ratio of (18)F-FLT and (11)C-MET were determined. Data of kinetic modeling, standardized uptake value, and T/B values derived from (18)F-FLT-PET were compared with T/B values derived from (11)C-MET-PET and to the in vitro proliferation marker Ki-67. RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between the metabolic rate constant Ki and the proliferation index as measured by Ki-67 immunostaining [Ki, r=0.79 (P=0.004)]. Also, the phosphorylation rate constant k3 correlated with Ki-67 [k3, r=0.76 (P=0.006)], whereas the rate constant for transport through the blood brain barrier K1 showed a weaker correlation with Ki-67 [K1, r=0.62 (P=0.044)]. No significant correlation between (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT uptake ratios and Ki-67 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that kinetic analysis of (18)F-FLT tracer uptake is essential for the in vivo assessment of tumor proliferation in high-grade gliomas, whereas uptake ratios of (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT failed to correlate with the in vitro determined proliferation marker. Thus, kinetic analysis of (18)F-FLT might provide an accurate method for the assessment of early response to glioma treatment in the future.

Title: Misdiagnoses of 11C-choline combined with 18F-FDG PET imaging in brain tumours.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The widely applied F-FDG is known for its disadvantage in brain tumour PET imaging because of its high background uptake. C-choline can achieve high contrast of brain tumour imaging and was expected to have higher sensitivity and specificity. We analysed the misdiagnoses in C-choline PET imaging in brain tumours with the aim of improving the accuracy of diagnosis with C-choline PET imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 10 patients proven to have been misdiagnosed on the basis of histopathological correlation and clinical follow-up among 94 patients (110 studies) who underwent C-choline PET/CT for diagnosed or suspected brain tumour between 23 March 2005 and 8 February 2007. C-choline PET imaging were performed on a Biograph Sensation 16 PET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Systems), F-FDG imaging was also performed as reference. RESULTS: Of all 10 misdiagnosed patients, five were false positive (one abscess, one tuberculosis, one benign gliocyte proliferation, one inflammatory granuloma and one demyelination), four were false negative (two metastases from lung cancer, one lymphoma, one grade II glioma) and one was misdiagnosed by wrong interpretation due to lack of experience. The rate of false positives was (5/110) 4.55%; the rate of false negatives was (4/110) 3.64%; the accuracy of C-choline alone was (93/110) 84.5%; by comparison, the accuracy of F-FDG alone was (78/110) 70.9%. CONCLUSIONS: C-choline imaging has a certain rate of false positivity and false negativity. With proper application, C-choline might have greater potential than F-FDG for brain tumour PET imaging.

Title: Grading of brain glioma with 1-11C-acetate PET: comparison with 18F-FDG PET.
Abstract: The objective of this study is to reevaluate the clinical significance of 1-11C-acetate (ACE) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with brain glioma, in comparison with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. METHODS: Ten patients with histologically proven glioma were included in this study. They underwent PET examination with both FDG and ACE on separate days. For ACE PET, 20-min data acquisition was performed just after the administration of 740 MBq of ACE; 10-20-min data were used for the analysis. FDG PET data acquisition for 10 min started 60 min postinjection of 370 MBq of FDG, approximately. Both reconstructed images were converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) images for patient body weight and injected dose. Regions of interest were placed on the tumor and the contralateral cerebral cortex, and SUV and tumor-to-cortex ratio (T/C) were calculated; these values were compared between high- and low-grade gliomas. RESULTS: SUV and T/C of ACE PET showed significant difference (SUV: 2.63+/-0.46 vs. 1.85+/-0.56, P=.03; T/C: 2.36+/-0.63 vs. 1.14+/-0.36, P=.02). In contrast, FDG PET revealed no significant difference in SUV or T/C between high- and low-grade gliomas (SUV: 7.13+/-4.31 vs. 4.71+/-1.27, P=.31; T/C: 0.98+/-0.55 vs. 0.62+/-0.09, P=.22). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study revealed that ACE PET is a promising tracer for the grading of brain glioma.

Title: Dynamic small-animal PET imaging of tumor proliferation with 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine in a genetically engineered mouse model of high-grade gliomas.
Abstract: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT), a partially metabolized thymidine analog, has been used in preclinical and clinical settings for the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of tumor proliferation status. We investigated the use of (18)F-FLT for detecting and characterizing genetically engineered mouse (GEM) high-grade gliomas and evaluating the pharmacokinetics in GEM gliomas and normal brain tissue. Our goal was to develop a robust and reproducible method of kinetic analysis for the quantitative evaluation of tumor proliferation. METHODS: Dynamic (18)F-FLT PET imaging was performed for 60 min in glioma-bearing mice (n = 10) and in non-tumor-bearing control mice (n = 4) by use of a dedicated small-animal PET scanner. A 3-compartment, 4-parameter model was used to characterize (18)F-FLT kinetics in vivo. For compartmental analysis, the arterial input was measured by placing a region of interest over the left ventricular blood pool and was corrected for partial-volume averaging. The (18)F-FLT "trapping" and tissue flux model parameters were correlated with measured uptake (percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) values at 60 min. RESULTS: (18)F-FLT uptake values (%ID/g) at 1 h in brain tumors were significantly greater than those in control brains (mean +/- SD: 4.33 +/- 0.58 and 0.86 +/- 0.22, respectively; P < 0.0004). Kinetic analyses of the measured time-activity curves yielded independent, robust estimates of tracer transport and metabolism, with compartmental model-derived time-activity data closely fitting the measured data. Except for tracer transport, statistically significant differences were found between the applicable model parameters for tumors and normal brains. The tracer retention rate constant strongly correlated with measured (18)F-FLT uptake values (r = 0.85, P < 0.0025), whereas a more moderate correlation was found between net (18)F-FLT flux and (18)F-FLT uptake values (r = 0.61, P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: A clinically relevant mouse glioma model was characterized by both static and dynamic small-animal PET imaging of (18)F-FLT uptake. Time-activity curves were kinetically modeled to distinguish early transport from a subsequent tracer retention phase. Estimated (18)F-FLT rate constants correlated positively with %ID/g measurements. Dynamic evaluation of (18)F-FLT uptake offers a promising approach for noninvasively assessing cellular proliferation in vivo and for quantitatively monitoring new antiproliferation therapies.

Title: Paradoxical imaging findings in cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: Gliomas represent approximately one-third of all intracranial tumors in adults and commonly present clinically with seizures. We report two seizure patients with paradoxical imaging findings on preoperative grading of their cerebral gliomas. A 53-year-old man with a history of temporal lobe epilepsy originating from a mass in the right medial temporal region (patient 1) and a 44-year-old man with a history of predominantly left sided sensory seizures with a mass in the right posterior parietal region (patient 2) underwent presurgical evaluation including MRI and glucose PET, followed by surgery to remove cerebral tumors associated with seizure onset. Preoperatively, patient 1 had a homogenous non-enhancing lesion on MRI and hypometabolism on PET imaging, suggesting a low-grade tumor. Postoperative histopathology was consistent with a glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV). Patient 2 had a heterogeneous lesion with cyst formation, edema, and contrast enhancement on preoperative MRI imaging, and interictal hypermetabolism on PET scan, thus suggesting a high-grade tumor. Postoperative histopathology was consistent with an oligodendroglioma (grade II) without anaplastic features. We conclude preoperative grading of cerebral gliomas may be inaccurate occasionally even in cases with concordant structural and functional imaging findings. This should be considered when counseling patients.

Title: The positive predictive value of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET in the diagnosis of a glioma recurrence after multimodal treatment.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore prospectively the positive predictive value of O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET in selected patients with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based suspicion of a glioma recurrence or progression. Methods Patients with a supratentorial glioma (initial World Health Organization (WHO) grade II, III or IV) were considered eligible if they had both an MRI-(new/progressive contrast-enhancing lesion) and FET-PET-based diagnosis of a recurrence/progression after various forms and combinations of irradiation and chemotherapy. Criterion for tumour recurrence/progression in FET-PET was a standardized uptake value (SUVmax)/Background (BG) ratio of >2.0 in the late uptake phase. All patients underwent multimodal (MRI, FET-PET) imaging-guided stereotactic biopsy. The positive predictive value was defined as the proportion of MRI and FET-PET findings indicating glioma recurrence/progression that also tested positive for tumour recurrence/progression after stereotactic biopsy. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with initially WHO grade II (17), WHO grade III (6), and grade IV glioma (8) were included. In 26 patients FET-PET results indicating tumour recurrence/progression were concordant with the biopsy results. In five patients histopathologic evaluation failed to reveal a "vital" tumour. FET-PET findings were also discordant with the radiographic and clinical follow-up in these five patients. The positive predictive value of FET-PET was 84%. CONCLUSION: The positive predictive value of FET-PET using the standard ratio method is high, but not high enough to replace stereotactic biopsy in this highly selected study cohort. Whether the calculation of FET uptake in the early phase and/or the evaluation of uptake kinetics will improve the positive predictive value of FET-PET deserves prospective evaluation.

Title: Diagnostic accuracy of 201Thallium-SPECT and 18F-FDG-PET in the clinical assessment of glioma recurrence.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Reliable differential diagnosis between tumour recurrence and treatment-induced lesions is required to take advantage of new therapeutic approaches to recurrent gliomas. Structural imaging methods offer a high sensitivity but a low specificity, which might be improved by neurofunctional imaging. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that incorporation of 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) increases the accuracy of this differential diagnosis obtained with 201Tl chloride-single-photon emission computed tomography (201Tl-SPECT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients (mean age 47.72 +/- 16.19 years) under suspicion of glioma recurrence, 42% with low-grade and 58% with high-grade lesions, were studied by (201)Tl-SPECT and FDG-PET, reporting results under blinded conditions using visual analysis. Tumour was confirmed by histological confirmation (23 patients) or clinical and structural neuroimaging follow-up (mean of 2.6 years). RESULTS: This population had a high disease prevalence (72%). Globally, highest sensitivity was obtained using 201Tl-SPECT assessed with MRI (96%) and highest specificity using FDG-PET + MRI (95%). FDG-PET appeared slightly better for confirming tumour recurrence, whereas 201Tl-SPECT was superior for ruling out possible recurrence (disease present in 38% of FDG-PET negative explorations). In the high-grade subgroup, there were no false-positive examinations (specificity: 100%), but sensitivity differed among techniques (201Tl-SPECT : 94%; 201Tl-SPECT + MRI: 97%; FDG-PET + MRI: 83%). In the low-grade subgroup, 201Tl-SPECT + MRI showed highest sensitivity (95%) and lowest posttest negative probability (9%); FDG-PET + MRI offered highest specificity (92%) with a posttest negative probability of 35%. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET does not clearly improve the diagnostic accuracy of (201)Tl-SPECT, which appears to be a more appropriate examination for the diagnosis of possible brain tumour recurrence, especially for ruling it out.

Title: Diagnostics of cerebral gliomas with radiolabeled amino acids.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the investigation of choice for diagnosing cerebral glioma, but its capacity to differentiate tumor tissue from non-specific tissue changes is limited. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using radiolabeled amino acids add information which helps increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: Review based on the authors' own research results and a selective literature review. RESULTS: The use of radiolabeled amino acids allows better delineation of tumor margins and improves targeting of biopsy and radiotherapy, and planning surgery. In addition, amino acid imaging appears useful in distinguishing tumor recurrence from non-specific post-therapeutic scar tissue, in predicting prognosis in low grade gliomas, and in monitoring metabolic response during treatment. DISCUSSION: The benefits of amino acid imaging in cerebral gliomas support arguments for its introduction into routine clinical practice in defined clinical situations; however, its influence on treatment quality remains to be demonstrated.

Title: Surgical target selection in cerebral glioma surgery: linking methionine (MET) PET image fusion and neuronavigation.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the histological correlate of (11)C-methionine (MET) PET uptake of brain gliomas by image fusion for navigated surgery. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (18 male, 9 female; mean age 42 years; range 11-77 years; 8 low-grade and 11 high-grade astrocytomas or mixed gliomas, 8 oligodendrogliomas) underwent MET PET studies preoperatively. RESULTS: MET PET tumor uptake was detected in 26 of 27 patients (96.3%). The quantitative MET tumor standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio was significantly higher in malignant gliomas and oligodendrogliomas than in low-grade gliomas (2.76/2.62 vs. 1.67, p=0.03). Generally, qualitative visual grading of MET uptake revealed 2 main patterns: focal MET uptake in 12 and uniform global MET uptake in 11 patients. Focal uptake corresponded to malignant glioma histology in 66.7%, and uniform global uptake to oligodendroglial histology in 72.7%. In oligodendrogliomas, global MET uptake constituted 81.5% (range 53.8-135%) of the MRI T(1) tumor volume on average and was limited to the MRI FLAIR tumor volume in 86% (7/8) of patients. Tissue samples of focal MET uptake areas correlated with histological anaplasia in 66.6% (8/12 glioma patients), although 62.5% (5/8 patients) lacked MRI contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION: MET PET image fusion may facilitate the targeting of anaplastic foci in homogeneous MRI non-enhancing gliomas for biopsy, may identify oligodendroglial histology preoperatively as well as characterize biologically active tumor volumes within MRI T(1)/FLAIR tumor areas of candidate patients for resection.

Title: Non-invasive grading of brain tumours using dynamic amino acid PET imaging: does it work for 11C-methionine?
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Static imaging of amino acids does not allow differentiation of low versus high grade brain tumours. It has been shown that dynamic imaging of the amino acid analogue (18)F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) can achieve this goal. In many centres, (11)C-methionine (MET) is used for tumour imaging, but no clinical studies on the use of dynamic scanning for grading have been performed. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with primary brain glioma and histopathological confirmation were retrospectively studied using 40 min dynamic MET-PET with 220 MBq 11C-methionine. In relation to histopathological grading, various metabolic indices and temporal parameters as documented by Poepperl et al. (JNM 2006;47:393-403) were analyzed. RESULTS: None of the evaluated static or temporal parameters allowed discrimination between high and low grade tumours. On average, low grade tumours showed washout after the initial uptake maximum, while both increases and decreases were seen for high grade tumours. Only the relative early versus late uptake ratio showed a trend towards significance (-0.16 +/- 0.17 for low grade versus 0.01 +/- 0.25 for high grade; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Unlike FET-PET, the uptake characteristics of MET-PET do not allow classification of low and high grade tumours on an individual patient basis. Since literature data indicate that both tracers have a similar performance regarding biopsy location, tumour delineation, and detection of recurrence, FET-PET should be advocated over MET-PET as its uptake mechanism also allows noninvasive grading in glioma.

Title: Haemorrhagic presentation of low-grade glioma in adults.
Abstract: Intracranial bleeding is rare in patients with low-grade gliomas, above all in adult population. We reviewed the literature of such cases and reported another case of a haemorrhagic low-grade glioma in a 54-year-old woman presenting with a left hemiparesis. Computer tomography (CT) images showed a right basal ganglia haemorrhage with no mass effect. Vascular malformations were ruled out by angiography. Eighteen fluoro-fluoro deossiglucosio (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) showed a large hypometabolic area corresponding to the lesion. We waited for patient's improvement. Late magnetic resonance images revealed a low-grade glioma at the bleeding site. Tumour was removed and histopathologic examination revealed a WHO grade II mixed glioma. The authors emphasize that this evidence has to be kept in mind since it has important therapeutic implications.

Title: Spatial heterogeneity of low-grade gliomas at the capillary level: a PET study on tumor blood flow and amino acid uptake.
Abstract: Many low-grade gliomas (World Health Organization grade II) respond to chemotherapy. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and microvessel density may be critical for drug delivery. We used PET with (18)F-fluoro-ethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) to measure the spatial distribution of the amino acid carrier, which is located at the brain capillaries, and (15)O-H(2)O to measure tumor CBF. METHODS: Seventeen patients with low-grade glioma were studied. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was used to quantify tumor tracer uptake, which was normalized to cerebellar uptake (tumor-to-cerebellum ratio). "Active" tumor was defined as tumor having a radioactivity concentration that was at least 110% of the cerebellar activity. This threshold provided measures of active tumor volume, global and peak tumor CBF, and (18)F-FET uptake. Trace ROIs were applied to create voxelwise profiles of CBF and (18)F-FET uptake across tumor and brain. Standard MRI sequences were used for spatial correlations. RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 tumors showed increased global CBF and (18)F-FET uptake. Active tumor volumes ranged between 3 and 270 cm(3) for (18)F-FET and between 1 and 41 cm(3) for CBF. Global (18)F-FET uptake in tumors corresponded to CBF increases (Spearman rank rho = 0.771, P < 0.01). The volumes of increased CBF and (18)F-FET uptake spatially coincided and were also correlated (rho = 0.944, P < 0.01). Trace ROIs showed that irrespective of increased (18)F-FET uptake at the tumor periphery, CBF increases were more confined to the tumor center. Within individual tumors, spatial heterogeneity was present. Particular tumors infiltrating the corpus callosum showed low CBF and (18)F-FET uptake in this tumor region. The patterns observed with PET were not reflected on MRI of the tumors, all of which presented as homogeneous non-gadolinium-enhancing lesions. CONCLUSION: Low-grade gliomas are heterogeneous tumors with regard to the distribution of amino acid uptake and CBF. Both are coupled in the tumor center. At the tumor periphery, where tumor infiltration of surrounding brain occurs, CBF may be low irrespective of increased (18)F-FET uptake. An ongoing study is investigating the effect of chemotherapy on these observations.

Title: 11C-Methionine positron emission tomography for preoperative evaluation of suggestive low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The treatment regimen for cerebral gliomas is different, depending on the histological grade of the lesion. The therapeutic strategy for anaplastic gliomas and glioblastomas is more aggressive, including microsurgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy. The management for low-grade gliomas is still under discussion, operation or "wait and see" tactics are possible options. Therefore the diagnostic imaging procedures are crucial for further treatment planning. Although most of the low-grade gliomas appear as hypointense lesions without contrast medium (CM) enhancement on magnetic resonance images, in some cases lesions without CM enhancement can be anaplastic tumours as well. 11C-Methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) was performed for preoperative evaluation of non or low CM enhancing intracerebral lesions, so-called suggestive low-grade gliomas. METHOD: 20 patients harbouring suggestive low-grade gliomas were included. Seventeen patients were found to be candidates for open surgery and 3 patients were planned for stereotactic biopsy due to the localisation of the lesions. MET-PET studies were performed a few days prior to surgery. On the day of surgery MRI sequences for neuronavigation planning were carried out (MPRAGE and FLAIR sequences). All image data were fused for operation with neuronavigation-guided microsurgery or stereotactic biopsy (BrainLAB Neuronavigation system, VectorVision 6.1). Biopsies were taken from the MET uptake areas as well as from areas without MET uptake. RESULTS: 2/20 patients showed sparse CM enhancement on MRI T (1) images, 18/20 patients had lesions without CM enhancement. MET uptake was found in 16/20 cases (T/N ratio 1.5 or more) and no MET uptake was documented in 4/20 cases (T/N ratio <1.5). Histologically the 2 patients with sparse CM enhancement and MET uptake were glioblastoma multiforme, 10/14 patients with MET uptake and without CM enhancement had an anaplastic astrocytoma WHO III, 3/14 with MET uptake and no CM enhancement had an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma WHO III, and 1/14 had an oligoastrocytoma grade II. The lesions of the 4 patients without MET uptake and without CM enhancement were classified as astrocytoma grade II in 2 cases, as astrocytoma grade I in 1 case and as astrocytoma III in one case. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, we find MET-PET to be a helpful tool for pretreatment evaluation of non-CM enhancing, suggestive low-grade intracerebral lesions. MET-PET adds valuable information for the decision-making for surgery or stereotactic biopsy.

Title: Association between fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and 1p and 19q loss of heterozygosity in World Health Organization Grade II gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECT: Oligodendroglial tumors harboring combined 1p and 19q loss (1p/19q LOH) are characterized by a favorable prognosis and response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but detection of 1p/19q LOH relies on postoperative procedures. The authors investigated the potential of fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) to predict 1p/19q LOH preoperatively in tumors whose appearance on initial magnetic resonance images was consistent with that of low-grade glioma. METHODS: The study population comprised 25 patients who had undergone preoperative FDG-PET followed by tumor resection. Neuronavigation ensured a precise match of FDG uptake with the site of biopsy. All tumor specimens were graded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Microsatellite analysis was used to identify 1p/19q LOH. In this series, 16 of 25 gliomas corresponded to WHO Grade II. In eight of these 16, 1p/19q LOH was detected. Raised glucose utilization within the tumor was seen in the six of eight WHO Grade II gliomas with 1p/19q LOH and in none of the WHO Grade II gliomas without this genetic alteration (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential of FDG-PET to predict 1p/19q LOH in WHO Grade II gliomas.

Title: Prognostic value of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET and MRI in low-grade glioma.
Abstract: In glioma of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II (low-grade glioma), the natural course of a particular patient is not predictable and the treatment strategy is controversial. We determined prognostic factors in adult patients with untreated, nonenhancing, supratentorial low-grade glioma with special regard to PET using the amino acid O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) and MRI. METHODS: In a prospective study, baseline (18)F-FET PET and MRI analyses were performed on 33 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed low-grade glioma. None of the patients had radiation or chemotherapy. Clinical, histologic, therapeutic (initial cytoreduction vs. biopsy), (18)F-FET uptake, and MRI morphologic parameters were analyzed for their prognostic significance. Statistical endpoints were clinical or radiologic tumor progression, malignant transformation to glioma of WHO grade III or IV (high-grade glioma), and death. RESULTS: Baseline (18)F-FET uptake and a diffuse versus circumscribed tumor pattern on MRI were highly significant predictors of prognosis (P < 0.01). By the combination of these prognostically significant variables, 3 major prognostic subgroups of low-grade glioma patients could be identified. The first of these subgroups was patients with circumscribed low-grade glioma on MRI without (18)F-FET uptake (n = 11 patients, progression in 18%, no malignant transformation and no death). The second subgroup was patients with circumscribed low-grade glioma with (18)F-FET uptake (n = 13 patients, progression in 46%, malignant transformation to a high-grade glioma in 15%, and death in 8%). The third subgroup was patients with diffuse low-grade glioma with (18)F-FET uptake (n = 9 patients, progression in 100%, malignant transformation to a high-grade glioma in 78%, and death in 56%). CONCLUSION: We conclude that baseline amino acid uptake on (18)F-FET PET and a diffuse versus circumscribed tumor pattern on MRI are strong predictors for the outcome of patients with low-grade glioma.

Title: Stereotactic comparison among cerebral blood volume, methionine uptake, and histopathology in brain glioma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascularity, metabolism, and histologic grade are related in gliomas but the exact determinants of these relationships are not fully defined. We used image coregistration and stereotactic biopsies to regionally compare cerebral blood volume (CBV) and (11)C-methionine (MET) uptake measurements in brain gliomas and to assess their relationship by histopathologic examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with brain gliomas underwent MR imaging, including dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR and positron-emission tomography (PET) using MET acquired in identical stereotactic conditions before biopsy. MR-based CBV maps were calculated and both CBV maps and PET images were coregistered to anatomic images. Sixty-five biopsy samples were obtained on trajectories targeted toward high MET uptake area. The following histopathologic features were semiquantified in each sample: mitotic activity, endothelial proliferation, cellular pleomorphism, and tumor necrosis. CBV and MET uptake values were measured in the biopsy area and normalized to contralateral white matter. CBV ratios were compared with MET uptake ratios, and both measurements were compared with histologic features of each sample. RESULTS: CBV ratios ranged from 0.08 to 10.24 (median = 1.73), and MET uptake ratios ranged from 0.30 to 4.91 (median = 1.67). There was a positive correlation between CBV ratios and MET uptake ratios (r = 0.65, P < .001). Both CBV and MET uptake ratios were found to be significantly related to endothelial proliferation and mitotic activity (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Within glial tumors, there is a local relationship between CBV and MET uptake measurements. Both provide indices of focal malignant activity.

Title: Evaluation of primary brain tumors with FLT-PET: usefulness and limitations.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: The purpose of this report was to investigate the potential of positron emission tomography using F-18 fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT-PET) in evaluating primary brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLT-PET was performed in 25 patients with primary brain tumors. FLT uptake in the lesion was semiquantitatively evaluated by measuring the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (TNR). SUVmax and TNR were compared with the histologic grade and the expression of the proliferation marker (Ki-67). RESULTS: FLT uptake in normal brain parenchyma was very low, resulting in the visualization of brain tumors with high contrast. Both SUVmax and TNR significantly correlated with the malignant grade of brain gliomas, in which high SUVmax/TNR was obtained for high-grade gliomas. Patients with primary lymphoma also showed SUVmax/TNR equivalent to glioblastoma. There was a positive correlation between SUVmax/TNR and the Ki-67 index. In contrast, spuriously high SUVmax and TNR were obtained in 3 of 6 patients with suspected recurrent tumors (2 patients with recurrent grade 2 glioma and one patient with postoperative granuloma), all of which showed lesion enhancement on MRI after Gd administration. CONCLUSIONS: FLT-PET can be used to evaluate the malignant grade and proliferation activity of primary brain tumors, especially malignant brain tumors. However, the presence of benign lesions showing blood-brain barrier disruption cannot be distinguished from malignant tumors and needs to be carefully evaluated.

Title: Paediatric brain-stem gliomas: MRI, FDG-PET and histological grading correlation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: MRI and FDG-PET may predict the histological grading of paediatric brain-stem gliomas. OBJECTIVE: To assess MRI findings and metabolic imaging using FDG-PET of brain-stem gliomas based on histological grading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included in the study were 20 paediatric patients (age 3-14 years, mean 8.2 years) with brain-stem glioma (five glioblastomas, ten anaplastic astrocytomas and five low-grade astrocytomas). MR images were assessed for the anatomical site of tumour origin, focality, pattern of tumour growth, and enhancement. RESULTS: All glioblastomas were located in the pons and showed diffuse pontine enlargement with focally exophytic features. Eight anaplastic astrocytomas were located in the pons and demonstrated diffuse pontine enlargement without exophytic features. Low-grade astrocytomas were located in the pons, midbrain or medulla and showed focally exophytic growth features and peripheral enhancement. In 12 patients in whom FDG-PET was undertaken, glioblastomas showed hypermetabolic or hypometabolic lesions, anaplastic astrocytomas showed no metabolic change or hypometabolic lesions and low-grade astrocytomas showed hypometabolism compared with the cerebellum. CONCLUSION: MRI findings correlated well with histological grading of brain-stem gliomas and MRI may therefore predict the histological grading. FDG-PET may be helpful in differentiating between anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastomas among high-grade tumours.

Title: Early change in glucose metabolic rate measured using FDG-PET in patients with high-grade glioma predicts response to temozolomide but not temozolomide plus radiotherapy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to predict response to temozolomide vs. temozolomide plus radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) were studied. Patients with recurrent glioma received temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 weeks (n=8). Newly diagnosed patients received temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily plus radiotherapy 60 Gy/30 fractions over 6 weeks, followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day (Days 1-5 q28) starting 1 month after radiotherapy (n=11). [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline, and 7 and 19 weeks after initiation of temozolomide administration. Changes in glucose metabolic rate (MRGlu) and MRI response were correlated with patient survival. RESULTS: In the temozolomide-alone group, patients who survived>26 vs. <or=26 weeks showed a greater reduction in MRGlu measured at 7 weeks with median changes of -34% and -4%, respectively (p=0.02). PET responders, defined as a reduction in MRGlu>or=25%, survived longer than nonresponders with mean survival times of 75 weeks (95% CI, 34-115 vs. 20 weeks (95% CI, 14-26) (p=0.0067). In the small group of patients studied, there was no relationship between MRI response and survival (p=0.52). For patients receiving temozolomide plus radiotherapy, there was no difference in survival between PET responders and nonresponders (p=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Early changes in MRGlu predict response to temozolomide, but not temozolomide plus radiotherapy.

Title: 18F-FET PET differentiation of ring-enhancing brain lesions.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore the differential diagnostic value of PET using the amino acid O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) in patients with newly diagnosed solitary intracerebral lesions showing ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI. METHODS: (18)F-FET PET analyses were performed on 14 consecutive patients with intracerebral ring-enhancing lesions. Eleven of the patients were additionally studied with (18)F-FDG PET. In all patients, the main differential diagnosis after MRI was a malignant lesion, in particular glioblastoma multiforme, versus a benign lesion, in particular brain abscess. A malignant tumor was suspected for lesions showing increased (18)F-FET uptake on PET images with a mean lesion-to-brain ratio of at least 1.6 ((18)F-FET PET positive). A nonneoplastic lesion was suspected in cases of minimal or absent (18)F-FET uptake, with a mean lesion-to-brain ratio of less than 1.6 ((18)F-FET PET negative). Histologic diagnosis was obtained by serial biopsies in 13 of the 14 patients. One patient refused the biopsy, but follow-up indicated an abscess because his lesion regressed under antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Histology and clinical follow-up showed high-grade malignant gliomas in 5 patients and nonneoplastic lesions in 9 patients. The findings of (18)F-FET PET were positive in all 5 glioma patients and in 3 of 9 patients with nonneoplastic lesions, including 2 patients with brain abscesses and 1 patient with a demyelinating lesion. The findings of (18)F-FDG PET were positive (mean lesion-to-gray matter ratio > or = 0.7) in 4 of 4 glioma patients and 3 of 7 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. CONCLUSION: Although (18)F-FET PET has been shown to be valuable for the diagnostic evaluation of brain tumors, our data indicate that, like (18)F-FDG PET, (18)F-FET PET has limited specificity in distinguishing between neoplastic and nonneoplastic ring-enhancing intracerebral lesions. Thus, histologic investigation of biopsy specimens remains mandatory to make this important differential diagnosis.

Title: Optimization of semi-quantification in metabolic PET studies with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11C-methionine in the determination of malignancy of gliomas.
Abstract: The treatment of the glioma patient depends on the nature of the lesion and on the aggressiveness of the tumor. The management of gliomas continues to be a challenging task, because morphological neuroimaging techniques do not always differentiate them from nontumoral lesions or high grade tumors from low grade lesions. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers the possibility of the in vivo quantitative characterization of brain tumors. Despite decades of useful application of PET in the clinical monitoring of gliomas, no consensus has been reached on the most effective image analysis approach for providing the best diagnostic performance under heavy-duty clinical diagnostic circumstances. The main objective of the present study was to find and validate optimal semi-quantitative search strategies for metabolic PET studies on gliomas, with special regard to the optimization of those metabolic tracer uptake ratios most sensitive in predicting histologic grade and prognosis. 11C-Methionine (11C-Met, n = 50) and/or 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG, n = 33) PET measurements were performed in 59 patients with primary and recurrent brain gliomas (22 high grade and 37 low grade tumors) in order to correlate the biological behavior and 11C-Met/18F-FDG uptake of tumors. Data were analyzed by region-of-interests (ROI) methods using standard uptake value calculation. Different ROI defining strategies were then compared with each other for two of the most commonly used metabolic radiotracers, 18F-FDG and 11C-Met, in order to determine their usefulness in grading gliomas. The results were compared to histological data in all patients. Both ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the performance of 18F-FDG was superior to that of 11C-Met for most of the ratios. 18F-FDG is therefore suggested as the tracer of choice for noninvasive semi-quantitative indicator of histologic grade of gliomas. 11C-Methionine has been suggested as a complimentary tracer, useful in delineating the extent of the tumor. The best diagnostic performance was obtained by calculating the ratio of the peak 18F-FDG uptake of the tumor to that of white matter (p < 0.001; ANOVA). This metabolic tracer uptake ratio is therefore suggested as an easily obtained semi-quantitative PET indicator of malignancy and histological grade in gliomas.

Title: Correlation of hypoxic cell fraction and angiogenesis with glucose metabolic rate in gliomas using 18F-fluoromisonidazole, 18F-FDG PET, and immunohistochemical studies.
Abstract: PET offers a noninvasive means to assess neoplasms, in view of its sensitivity and accuracy in staging tumors and potentially in monitoring treatment response. The aim of this study was to evaluate newly diagnosed primary brain tumors for the presence of hypoxia, as indicated by the uptake of 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) and to examine the relationship of hypoxia to the uptake of 18F-FDG and molecular markers of hypoxia. METHODS: Seventeen patients with suspected primary glioma were enrolled prospectively in this study. Sixteen patients had histology, with 2 having metastatic disease. All patients had PET studies with 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG and MRI studies. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken with tumor markers of angiogenesis and hypoxia. Patients were monitored for disease progression and statistical analysis of data was performed. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients with histology, 8 died with a median time of 16 mo (range, 2-30 mo) until death. Of those who died, 7 had positive and 1 had negative 18F-FMISO uptake. 18F-FMISO uptake was observed in all high-grade gliomas but not in low-grade gliomas. A significant relationship was found between 18F-FDG or 18F-FMISO uptake and expression of VEGF-R1 and Ki67 expression. Other immunohistochemical markers demonstrated a trend toward increased uptake but none was significant. CONCLUSION: 18F-FMISO PET provides a noninvasive assessment of hypoxia in glioma and was prognostic for treatment outcomes in the majority of patients. 18F-FMISO PET may have a role not only in directing patients toward targeted hypoxic therapies but also in monitoring response to such therapies.

Title: Analysis of 18F-FET PET for grading of recurrent gliomas: is evaluation of uptake kinetics superior to standard methods?
Abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether extended analyses of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) uptake kinetics provide results superior to those of standard tumor-to-background ratios in predicting tumor grade in patients with pretreated gliomas. METHODS: Dynamic 18F-FET PET studies (0-40 min after injection of 180 MBq of 18F-FET) were performed on 45 glioma patients with suspected tumor recurrence after multimodal treatment. For the standard method, tumoral maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the ratio to the background were derived from a summed image 20-40 min after injection. Dynamic data evaluation comprised several approaches: first, SUV within a 90% isocontour threshold (SUV90) and the respective ratio to the background calculated for each time frame between 5 and 40 min after injection; second, the time to peak analysis; and third, various parameters accounting for the individual time course of 18F-FET uptake. Results were correlated with the histopathologic findings of MRI/PET-guided stereotactic biopsies and were evaluated with respect to their discriminatory power to separate low- from high-grade tumors using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: The parameters taking into account the individual time course of 18F-FET uptake were able to differentiate low-grade from high-grade recurrent astrocytomas with high diagnostic accuracy, reaching the best differentiation with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94. For the other parameters, the respective values were considerably lower (time to peak: 85% sensitivity and 88% specificity; SUV90-to-background ratio for single-frame evaluation of the early-uptake phase: 100% sensitivity, 62% specificity, and 0.81 AUC). The lowest performance was provided by the standard method (SUVmax: 73% sensitivity, 54% specificity, and 0.60 AUC; SUVmax-to-background ratio: 62% sensitivity, 62% specificity, and 0.59 AUC). Time-activity curves (5-40 min after injection) slightly and steadily increased in tumor-free patients and in low-grade tumors, whereas high-grade tumors showed an early peak around 10-15 min after injection followed by a decrease. CONCLUSION: This study has shown differences in the dynamics of 18F-FET uptake between recurrent low- and high-grade gliomas. Therefore, parameters addressing the different kinetic behaviors allow discrimination with high diagnostic power between these 2 prognostically different groups. Thus, the techniques introduced here are clearly superior to the yet most widely used standard method.

Title: Correlation of amino-acid uptake using methionine PET and histological classifications in various gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The uptake of L-methyl-11C-methionine (MET) by gliomas is greater than that by intact tissue, making methionine very useful for evaluation of tumor extent. If the degree of malignancy of brain tumors can be evaluated by MET-PET, the usefulness of MET-PET as a means of diagnosing brain tumors will increase. METHODS: We performed this study on 67 glioma patients between 3 and 69 years of age (36 males and 31 females). Tumors included diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, medulloblastoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, choroid plexus papilloma, central neurocytoma, optic glioma, gliomatosis cerebri, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and ganglioglioma. Tumor activity and degree of malignancy were evaluated using Ki-67LI (LI: labeling index) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The correlations between methionine uptake and tumor proliferation (tumor versus contralateral gray matter ratio (T/N) and Ki-67LI) were determined for the group of all subjects. The existence of significant correlations between T/N and Ki-67LI and between SUV and Ki-67LI was determined for astrocytic tumors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of T/N and standardized uptake value (SUV) was performed for the group of astrocytic tumors. We also determined the ROC cut-off levels to ensure high accuracy of the analysis. RESULTS: For the 67 cases of glioma, the degree of accumulation was variable. Ki-67LI differed significantly between the high-grade group and low-grade group at T/N levels between 1.5 and 1.8 on analysis using tumor proliferative potential (p = 0.019-0.031). The prognosis differed significantly between the high-grade and low-grade groups when T/N was in the range of 1.6-1.8 (p = 0.028-0.032). The accuracy thus calculated was highest (85.7%) when T/N was 1.5 as determined by ROC analysis. CONCLUSIONS: When analysis was confined to cases of astrocytic tumor, a correlation was noted between methionine accumulation and Ki-67LI. For the astrocytic tumors, T/N ratio seemed to be more useful as a diagnostic indicator than SUV. The cut-off level of T/N ratio for distinction between high-grade and low-grade astrocytoma appears to lie between 1.5 and 1.6.

Title: Usefulness of L-[methyl-11C] methionine-positron emission tomography as a biological monitoring tool in the treatment of glioma.
Abstract: OBJECT: The authors retrospectively analyzed the data obtained in patients who had undergone L-[methyl-11C] methionine (MET)-positron emission tomography (PET) studies to clarify the relationship between MET uptake and tumor biological features and to discuss the clinical usefulness of MET-PET studies. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients with cerebral glioma or suspected glioma underwent PET scanning 20 minutes after injection of MET, whose uptake into the tumor was expressed as a ratio to contralateral healthy brain tissue (T/N ratio). Analyses were performed to determine how MET uptake correlated with tumor pathological features and prognosis. The T/N ratios before and after various treatments were also examined. There were significant differences in the T/N ratio among the nonneoplastic lesions, low-grade gliomas, and malignant gliomas. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between patient survival and pretreatment T/N ratios. Among patients with malignant gliomas, a significant difference in survival was observed between cases with and without postoperative tumor remnant based on elevated MET uptake. The MET uptake was heterogeneous even among the homogeneous tumor areas demonstrated on MR imaging. Malignant pathological features were detected in the areas with the highest MET uptake. The effectiveness of radiotherapy or chemotherapy was expressed as a significantly decreased T/N ratio in some of the tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of MET-PET to reflect the biological nature of gliomas makes it an excellent method for monitoring active tumor tissue, and treatments based on its findings should provide a powerful clinical protocol in the course of glioma therapy.

Title: PET and SPECT in low-grade glioma.
Abstract: Low-grade gliomas (LGG) account for 30-40% of all gliomas and are primarily treated with surgery. Since both timing and use of other oncological treatments in LGG are a matter of controversy, there has been a constantly increasing demand to characterize these often slowly growing neoplasms with functional imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). PET and SPECT yield information on growth rate and heterogeneity of LGG and are especially useful in follow-up since metabolic changes tend to precede structural changes detected with structure-based imaging methods. Furthermore, for planning of LGG surgery or radiotherapy coregistration of functional images with CT and MRI is invaluable. This is increasingly performed with a new generation of hybrid scanners with integrated PET or SPECT and CT.

Title: Reirradiation of recurrent high-grade gliomas using amino acid PET (SPECT)/CT/MRI image fusion to determine gross tumor volume for stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop a valid treatment strategy for recurrent high-grade gliomas using stereotactic hypofractionated reirradiation based on biologic imaging and temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial included a total of 44 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas (1 patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 8 with anaplastic astrocytoma, 33 with glioblastoma multiforme, and 2 with gliosarcoma) after previous surgery and postoperative conventional radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. For fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SFRT) treatment planning, the gross tumor volume was defined by (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) or (123)I-alpha-methyl-tyrosine (IMT) single-photon computed emission tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fusion in 82% of the patients and by CT/T1+gadolinium-MRI image fusion in 18% of the patients. Six fractions of 5 Gy were administered in 6 days. In 29 of 44 patients (66%), chemotherapy with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) body surface/day) was given in one to two cycles before and four to five cycles after SFRT. The patients were evaluated in follow-up by clinical investigators and MRI or CT every 3 months after SFRT until death. In cases suspicious for radiation necrosis, a MET-PET or IMT-SPECT investigation was performed. RESULTS: The median survival time in the whole group was 8 months. Treatment planning based on PET(SPECT)/CT/MRI imaging was associated with improved survival in comparison to treatment planning using CT/MRI alone: median survival time 9 months vs. 5 months (p = 0.03, log-rank). Median survival time were 11 months for patients who received SFRT based on biologic imaging plus temozolomide and significantly lower, 6 months for patients treated with SFRT without biologic imaging, without temozolomide or without both (p = 0.008, log rank). The most important prognostic factor in univariate analysis was a long interval between initial diagnosis and recurrence (p = 0.0002, log-rank). In the multivariate model, time interval to retreatment (p = 0.006) and temozolomide (p = 0.04) remained statistically significant. No acute neurologic toxicity Grade 3 or higher and no Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of biologic imaging optimized SFRT plus temozolomide in recurrent high-grade gliomas. It demonstrates the feasibility and safety of this approach. The most striking result of the trial is the statistically significant longer survival time in the univariate analysis for patients reirradiated using MET-PET or IMT-SPECT/CT/MRI image fusion in the treatment planning, in comparison to patients treated based on MRI/CT alone. Multivariate analysis confirmed a significant survival benefit from multimodal treatment (i.e., addition of temozolomide), despite the limited number of patients. Whether treatment planning with SPECT/PET independently influences survival has to be studied in a larger series of patients.

Title: A novel brainstem tumor model: guide screw technology with functional, radiological, and histopathological characterization.
Abstract: OBJECT: Survival rates for high-grade brainstem tumors are approximately 10% and optimal therapy has yet to be determined. Development of a satisfactory brainstem tumor model is necessary for testing new therapeutic paradigms that may prolong survival. The authors report the technique, functional progression, radiological appearance, and histopathological features of a novel brainstem tumor model in rats. METHODS: Thirty female Fischer 344 rats were randomized (10 animals/group) to receive an injection of either 3 ml of 9L gliosarcoma cells (100,000 cells), 3 ml of F98 glioma cells (100,000 cells), or 3 ml of medium (Dulbecco modified Eagle medium) into the pontine tegmentum of the brainstem. Using a cannulated guide screw system implanted in the skull of the animal, rats in each group were injected at coordinates 1.4 mm to the right of the sagittal and 1 mm anterior to the lambdoid sutures, at a depth of 7 mm from the dura mater. The angle of the syringe during injection was anteflexed 5 degrees from the vertical. Postoperatively, the rats were evaluated for neurological deficits by using an automated rotarod test. High-resolution [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) fused with computerized tomography (CT) scans were acquired pre- and postoperatively through the onset of hemiparesis and correlated accordingly. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for survival and disease progression, and brains were processed postmortem for histopathological investigation. The 9L and F98 tumor cells grew in 95% of the animals in which they were injected and resulted in a statistically significant mean onset of hemiparesis of 16.5 6 0.56 days (p = 0.001, log-rank test), compared with animals in the control group, which had no neurological deficits by Day 45. The FDG-PET studies coregistered with CT scans demonstrated space-occupying brainstem lesions, and this finding was confirmed by histological studies. Animals in the control group showed no functional, radiological, or pathological signs of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Progression to hemiparesis was consistent in all tumor-injected animals, with predictable onset of symptoms occurring approximately 17 days postsurgery. The histopathological and radiological characteristics of the 9L and F98 brainstem tumors were comparable to those of aggressive primary human brainstem tumors. Establishment of this animal tumor model will facilitate the testing of new therapeutic paradigms for the treatment of these lesions.

Title: Baseline 11C-methionine PET reflects the natural course of grade 2 oligodendrogliomas.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) with the amino acid tracer 11C-methionine (MET) as a predictor of time to progression (TTP) in patients with supratentorial grade 2 gliomas. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with glioma grade 2 subjected to a baseline PET scan received no anti-tumour treatment except for a diagnostic operation, and were followed until tumour progression. The prognostic impact of the MET uptake and of other prognostic factors was studied. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the patients (93%) experienced tumour progression after a median of 103 weeks. Low uptake of MET was a predictor for long TTP in patients with oligodendrogliomas (p = 0.04) but not in astrocytomas/oligoastrocytomas. Other predictors for long TTP were oligodendroglioma histology (p = 0.009) and seizures as presenting symptom (p = 0.03). Favourable prognostic factors for overall survival were oligodendroglioma histology (p = 0.002) and good performance status (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: PET MET has a definite role in the therapeutic management of grade 2 gliomas. However, for the optimal use of PET MET in the clinical management of these patients, histological subclassification of the tumour is required.

Title: Assessment of clinical usefulness of 131I alpha-methyl-tyrosine and fused SPECT/MRI imaging for diagnostics of recurrent cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early detection and diagnostic differentiation of neoplastic tissue from necrotic changes and scars following the treatment of cerebral gliomas is essential for determining further therapy and prognosis. The primary technique used for the diagnostics of recurrent neoplastic growth is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which in some cases, however, does not allow one to identify the character of cerebral lesions. Recently, MRI has been supplemented with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) employing radiolabelled amino acids. e.g. tyrosine or methionine. The aim of the project was to assess the diagnostic potential of SPECT when iodine-131 alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT), a Polish make of radiopharmaceutical (OBRI--POLATOM, Otwock-Rwierk, Poland), was applied. The use of 131I as a substitute for the more costly, imported iodine-123 has been justified in view of the nature and significance of the diagnostic problem on the one hand, and the possibility of 131-iodine application on a larger scale in CEE countries, on the other. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRI and SPECT were performed in 24 patients with a history of surgical treatment and radiotherapy of cerebral glioma (WHO grade II/IV). A SPECT was carried out 15 min after an i.v. injection of 74-111 MBq IMT. The tomograms were evaluated visually and in quantitative terms. The fused SPET/MR images were also analyzed. The obtained results were verified against histopathological findings, control MRI examinations and the clinical course of disease within 7-28 months of monitoring. RESULTS: In 19 patients, an increased IMT uptake indicative of a recurrent tumour was found, and the presence of the tumour was confirmed. In five patients no hot spots were detected which would indicate the neoplastic growth and verification did not provide any evidence for relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The examination employing iodine-131 IMT made it possible to confirm or exclude tumour recurrence in all the subjects, also in the cases when the CT/MR images were inconclusive. The MRI/SPECT fusion made it possible to more accurately identify the location of tumour recurrence as well as determine the area for spectroscopic MR analysis, for stereotactic biopsy and radiotherapy.

Title: Imaging proliferation in brain tumors with 18F-FLT PET: comparison with 18F-FDG.
Abstract: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a recently developed PET tracer to image tumor cell proliferation. We characterized (18)F-FLT PET of brain gliomas and compared (18)F-FLT with (18)F-FDG PET in side-by-side studies of the same patients. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated glioma underwent PET with (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG on consecutive days. Three stable patients in long-term remission were included as negative control subjects. Tracer kinetics in normal brain and tumor were measured. Uptake of (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG was quantified by the standardized uptake value (SUV) and the tumor-to-normal tissue (T/N) ratio. The accuracy of (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG PET in evaluating newly diagnosed and recurrent gliomas was compared. More than half of the patients underwent resection after the PET study and correlations between PET uptake and the Ki-67 proliferation index were examined. Patients were monitored for a mean of 15.4 mo (range, 12-20 mo). The predictive power of PET for tumor progression and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics. RESULTS: (18)F-FLT uptake in tumors was rapid, peaking at 5-10 min after injection and remaining stable up to 75 min. Hence, a 30-min scan beginning at 5 min after injection was sufficient for imaging. (18)F-FLT visualized all high-grade (grade III or IV) tumors. Grade II tumor did not show appreciable (18)F-FLT uptake and neither did the stable lesions. The absolute uptake of (18)F-FLT was low (maximum-pixel SUV [SUV(max)], 1.33) but image contrast was better than with (18)F-FDG (T/N ratio, 3.85 vs. 1.49). (18)F-FDG PET studies were negative in 5 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma who subsequently suffered tumor progression within 1-3 mo. (18)F-FLT SUV(max) correlated more strongly with Ki-67 index (r = 0.84; P < 0.0001) than (18)F-FDG SUV(max) (r = 0.51; P = 0.07). (18)F-FLT uptake also had more significant predictive power with respect to tumor progression and survival (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thirty-minute (18)F-FLT PET 5 min after injection was more sensitive than (18)F-FDG to image recurrent high-grade tumors, correlated better with Ki-67 values, and was a more powerful predictor of tumor progression and survival. Thus, (18)F-FLT appears to be a promising tracer as a surrogate marker of proliferation in high-grade gliomas.

Title: Does increased 18FDG uptake reflect malignant transformation of a low-grade glioma? A diagnostic dilemma.
Abstract: Benign gliomas of the brain show decreased uptake of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET). Malignant transformation is usually manifested by an increase of 18FDG uptake. A 45-year-old female has been followed up since 1987 by means of 18FDG-PET for a right hemispheric World Health Organization Grade II oligoastrocytoma. In 1996, increased epileptic activity was accompanied by increased 18FDG uptake within the temporal part of the tumor. After surgery, the epileptic seizures diminished. Histological examination of the resected tumor showed no change in the pathology when compared with the first biopsy. Localized temporal increase of 18FDG uptake was not associated with malignant progression. The decrease of seizure frequency might shed light on a putative connection of hyperglycolysis and epileptic discharges.

Title: Phase II study of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in children with recurrent and progressive multicentric glioma : a preliminary report.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the response rates, survival and toxicity of treatment with antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 (ANP) in the first 12 children enrolled in our studies diagnosed with incurable recurrent and progressive multicentric glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients' median age was 9 years. Six patients were diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma, four with low-grade astrocytoma and one with astrocytoma grade 2. In one case of visual pathway glioma, a biopsy was not performed due to a dangerous location. Patients received ANP intravenously initially and subsequently orally. The average duration of intravenous ANP therapy was 16 months and the average dosage of A10 was 7.95 g/kg/day and of AS2-1 was 0.33 g/kg/day. The average duration of oral ANP was 19 months and the average dosage of A10 and AS2-1 was 0.28 g/kg/day. Responses were assessed by MRI according to the National Cancer Institute's criteria and confirmed by PET scans in some cases. RESULTS: Complete response was accomplished in 33%, partial response in 25%, and stable disease in 33% of patients, and there was no progressive disease. One patient was non-evaluable due to only 4 weeks of ANP and lack of follow-up scans. One patient who had stable disease discontinued ANP against medical advice and died 4.5 years later. Ten patients are alive and well from 2 to >14 years post-diagnosis. Only one case of serious toxicity of reversible tinnitus, of one day's duration, was described. The study continues with accrual of additional patients. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study are favourable in comparison with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We believe that confirmation of these results through further studies may introduce a new promising treatment for incurable paediatric brain tumours.

Title: [Contribution of PET to the management of patients with low-grade glioma].
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Management of patients with low-grade glioma is a major challenge for the neurosurgeon. When is neurosurgery indicated? Should chemotherapy or radiotherapy be used? Many questions without an answer. We reviewed our experience with 65 patients treated for low-grade glioma who had preoperative PET images (FDG or/and MET). We examined the prognostic value of PET and also determined the sensitivity and the specificity of PET images to predict outcome. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with a FDG or MET PET images were analyzed. We used two visual scales and had complete follow-up data for 63 patients. The free interval was the principal criterion for statistical analysis. The sensitivity and the specificity of PET images was determined. RESULTS: Strong FDG uptake was correlated with a short free interval (p=0.001). Similar results were found with the MET analysis (p=0.0076). We had a PET with MET and FDG for 36 patients. The sensitivity was 66% and the specificity 94% for FDG PET. Sensitivity was 100% and specificity 53% for MET PET. CONCLUSIONS: PET imaging provides a prognostic factor independent from histology. MET PET is the best exam for the follow-up of patients with low-grade glioma and is helpful for separating aggressive from low-grade glioma.

Title: [Metabolic imaging to follow stereotactic radiation of gliomas -- the role of 1H MR spectroscopy in comparison to FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT].
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical value of 1H MR spectroscopy (1H MRSI) for follow-up of irradiated glioma compared to positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) and single photon emission tomography with [123I]-a-methyl-L-tyrosine (IMT-SPECT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with irradiated gliomas were examined using 1H MRSI (2D spectroscopic imaging; PRESS; TE = 135 msec; 1.5T Magnetom Vision, Siemens; Voxel size 9 x 9 x 15 mm (3)). MR spectra (n = 233) were evaluated in areas suspicious of tumor (n = 86) as well as in healthy appearing brain tissue (n = 147). Relative signal intensity ratios of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) were calculated. PET scans (n = 19) were performed with 200 - 250 MBq FDG, IMT-SPECT examinations (n = 14) with 200 - 250 mBq IMT. Based on clinical and MRI/CT, follow-up lesions were classified as either neoplastic [PT] or non-neoplastic [nPT]. RESULTS: True positive results for the diagnosis of PT/nPT were 88/89 % (1H MRSI), 73/100 % (PET) and 100/75 % (SPECT). Cho/Cr showed highly significant changes for PT. Determinating a correlation between Cho, Cr, NAA and IMT-SPECT as well as FDG-PET was not possible because of different location of maximum tracer uptake and acquired 2D 1H MRSI. CONCLUSION: IMT-SPECT seems to be superior to detect tumor progression in irradiated gliomas. 1H MRSI was more suitable than FDG-PET to differentiate between recurrence and radiation-induced changes. FDG-PET plays a role as sensitive method for detecting high-grade tumors. PET and SPECT allowed the examination of the entire tumor including surrounding brain tissue with higher spatial resolution than the acquired 2D 1H MRSI. A main limitation of our study was that only 2D 1H MRSI was used, with only parts of the tumor evaluated. The use of 3D MR spectroscopic imaging may further increase the diagnostic accuracy.

Title: Direct comparison of 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET in suspected recurrence of glioma: sensitivity, inter-observer variability and prognostic value.
Abstract: PURPOSE: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 11C-methionine (MET) PET imaging studies allow the investigation of metabolism and amino acid transport in brain tumours. Their (relative) usefulness and prognostic value in suspected recurrence or progression of primary brain tumours after previous therapy is an issue of debate. The aim of this study was to compare directly both radioligands in this setting. METHODS: Cerebral uptake of FDG and MET was determined sequentially on the same day in 30 patients (21 males, nine females; age 40.4+/-15.6 years), on average 4.0 years (range 0.1-18) after therapy for a primary brain tumour (23 grade II-IV astrocytomas, four oligodendrogliomas and three mixed oligo-astrocytomas). Images were acquired on a Siemens HR+ dedicated PET camera. Two observers scored FDG and MET scans independently. Semi-quantitative indices defined by the tumour (maximum)-to-background ratio were calculated based on manual ROI delineation and by using MET ROIs for FDG after automated co-registration. Patient follow-up was conducted until the last contact with inconspicuous clinical findings (average 41 months, range 12-62 months after PET) [(n=10)] or until death (n=20). RESULTS: Overall median survival was 15.0 months. MET showed pathologically increased uptake in 28/30 scans, and FDG in 17/30. The inter-observer agreement was 100% for MET and 73% for FDG. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, significant differences were found for both FDG (cut-off 0.8, log-rank p=0.007) and MET (cut-off 2.2, log-rank p=0.014). The combination of FDG and MET information resulted in the highest prognostic accuracy (p=0.003), while MET alone was the best prognostic predictor in the subgroup of patients with primary astrocytoma (n=23). CONCLUSION: FDG and MET PET studies provide complementary prognostic information in patients with suspected brain tumour recurrence or progression after primary therapy. MET is considered the single agent of choice in the evaluation of these patients because of its sensitivity and clearer delineation of the suspected recurrence.

Title: Comparison of 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine for PET-guided stereotactic brain biopsy of gliomas.
Abstract: We compared the contributions of the labeled tracers (11)C-methionine (Met) and (18)F-FDG for PET-guided stereotactic biopsy of brain gliomas. METHODS: In 32 patients with glioma, stereotactic Met PET and (18)F-FDG PET were integrated in the planning of stereotactic brain biopsy. PET images were analyzed to determine which tracer offered the best information for target definition. The stereotactic coregistration of PET images allowed accurate comparison of the level, distribution, and extent of uptake for both tracers according to tumor location and grade. RESULTS: A histologic diagnosis was obtained for all patients. All gliomas had an area of abnormal Met uptake, and 27 showed abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake. (18)F-FDG was used for target selection when its uptake was higher in tumor than in gray matter (14 gliomas). Seven were in the basal ganglia or brain stem. Met was used for target selection when there was no (18)F-FDG uptake or when (18)F-FDG uptake was equivalent to that in the gray matter (18 gliomas). Thirteen were in the cortex. Sixty-one of the 70 stereotactic trajectories obtained from the 32 patients were based on PET-defined targets and had an area of abnormal Met uptake. These 61 Met-positive trajectories always yielded a diagnosis of tumor. All nondiagnostic trajectories (n = 9) were obtained in areas with no increased uptake of Met. In all patients with increased uptake of both tracers, the focus of highest Met uptake corresponded to the focus of highest (18)F-FDG uptake. However, the extent of uptake of both tracers was variable. CONCLUSION: Distributions of highest Met and (18)F-FDG uptake are similar in brain gliomas. Because Met provides a more sensitive signal, it is the molecule of choice for single-tracer PET-guided neurosurgical procedures in gliomas.

Title: Value of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- L-tyrosine PET for the diagnosis of recurrent glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with recurrent gliomas depends on reliable and early diagnosis of tumour recurrence after initial therapy. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) often fail to differentiate between radiation- and tumour-induced contrast enhancement. Furthermore, absence of contrast enhancement, or even of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in PET, does not exclude recurrence. The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic value of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)- L-tyrosine (FET) PET in recurrent gliomas. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with glioma (primary grading: 27=WHO grade IV, 16=grade III, 9=grade II, 1=grade I) and clinically suspected recurrence underwent FET PET scans 4-180 months after different treatment modalities. For semiquantitative evaluation, maximal SUV (SUVmax) and mean SUV within 80% and 70% isocontour thresholds (SUV80/SUV70) were evaluated and the respective ratios to the background (BG) were calculated. PET results were correlated with MRI/CT, clinical follow-up or biopsy findings. RESULTS: All patients presented with FET uptake, of varying intensity, in the area of the primary tumour after initial therapy. In the 42 patients with confirmed recurrence, there was additional distinct focal FET uptake with significantly higher values compared with those in the 11 patients without clinical signs of recurrence and showing only low and homogeneous FET uptake at the margins of the resection cavity. With respect to tumour grading, there was a slight but non-significant increase from WHO II (SUVmax/BG: 2.53+/-0.28) to WHO III (SUVmax/BG: 2.84+/-0.49) and WHO IV (SUVmax/BG: 3.55+/-1.07) recurrence. CONCLUSION: FET PET reliably distinguishes between post-therapeutic benign lesions and tumour recurrence after initial treatment of low- and high-grade gliomas.

Title: Early effects of irradiation on [(123)I]-IMT and [(18)F]-FDG uptake in rat C6 glioma cells.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 3-[(123)I]-iodo-L-alpha-methyltyrosine ([(123)I]-IMT) and positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) are valuable tools for the distinction between viable tumor and radionecrosis in patients receiving radiotherapy for high-grade gliomas. However, to date, little is known about the early effects of radiation on [(123)I]-IMT and [(18)F]-FDG uptake in gliomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To determine the early effects of irradiation on [(123)I]-IMT and [(18)F]-FDG uptake in gliomas, in vitro studies were performed using rat C6 glioma cells. The glioma cells were irradiated with 20 Gy which is a common dose applied to patients receiving intraoperative radiotherapy. Subsequently, the early kinetics of [(123)I]-IMT and [(18)F]-FDG uptake in glioma cells were monitored for 3 days. RESULTS: Micromorphometric examinations of the irradiated glioma cells revealed that about 25% of the viable cells transformed into giant cells. [(123)I]-IMT uptake per 10(5) viable glioma cells was unchanged on the 1st day post irradiation, but showed a significant increase on the 2nd and 3rd day following radiotherapy (p < 0.01). In addition, there was a moderate increase in [(18)F]- FDG accumulation per 10(5) viable glioma cells during the first 3 days after irradiation (p < 0.05). The maximum increase in early [(123)I]-IMT uptake 1 h after application surpassed that of [(18)F]-FDG (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Rat C6 glioma cells show an early increase in [(123)I]-IMT and [(18)F]-FDG uptake following irradiation which may be partly due to giant cell formation. These data suggest that [(123)I]-IMT SPECT and [(18)F]-FDG PET may be promising procedures for the early prediction of the therapeutic response of gliomas to radiotherapy.

Title: Combined use of F-18 fluorocholine positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for brain tumor evaluation.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Choline metabolism is often abnormal in malignant brain tumors. METHODS: Brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 fluorocholine (FCH) was performed on 2 patients with intracranial lesions suspected to be high-grade malignant gliomas on the basis of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and multivoxel 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) findings. Standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements on PET were compared with measurements of choline/creatine metabolite ratio on MRSI in corresponding regions. Brain biopsy revealed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in one case and demyelinating disease in the other. RESULTS: In the case of GBM, the tumor demonstrated increased FCH uptake on PET. The mean and maximum SUV in areas of the tumor correlated with regional choline/creatine ratio measurements (r = 0.76, P < .001; r = 0.83, P < .001, respectively). In the case of tumefactive demyelinating lesions, the lesion demonstrated low FCH uptake, which did not correlate with choline/creatine ratio measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments of choline metabolism may aid in evaluating intracranial mass lesions.

Title: [Evaluation for degree of malignancy and prognosis of patients with brain glioma using 99Tcm-MIBI brain SPECT].
Abstract: BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: It is important and useful to evaluate the degree of malignancy for therapeutic scheme and prognosis evaluation. Traditional imaging methods such as CT and MRI play the important role in distinguishing glioma, but sometimes it was still difficult to diagnose accurately only having the aid of these anatomic information. Stereotaxic needle biopsy is an invasive method and indicates only local pathologic change, sometimes the error of sample collection will result in inaccurate grading. 18F-FDG PET can reflect the glucose metabolic rate of tumor directly and is thought as the most useful method, but the cost is too high so that it cannot be used widely at present. This study measured (99)Tc(m)-MIBI uptake in the patients with different pathological types using (99)Tc(m)-MIBI brain scan and evaluated the malignant degree of astrocytoma and its prognosis. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with glioma and 15 collators were retrospectively analyzed. (99)Tc(m)-MIBI was injected into each patient via elbow vein. SPECT was performed 20 min(early phase) and 2 h (delayed phase) after injection. (1)Diagnostic indices such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated. (2) The tumor to non-tumor ratios (T/N) were calculated according to ROI and compared between groups of different malignancy grading by t-test. (3) The survival time (by means of mean survival time, MST) after (99)Tc(m)-MIBI brain SPECT was follow-up surveyed. According to T/N ratios, the patients were divided into four groups. The MST was compared between four groups by t-test. RESULTS: (1) Among 52 cases of glioma, 44 showed positive and 2 collators showed false-positive on (99)Tc(m)-MIBI SPECT and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.6%, 86.7%, and 85.1%,respectively. (2) On early phase and delayed phase,when T/N ratio was compared, there was no significant difference between grade-I astrocytoma and grade-II astrocytoma (P >0.05), nor was between patients with ependymocytomas and patients with oligodendrogliomas (P >0.05). There was significantly different between every other two groups (P< 0.001),showing the higher the malignancy of astrocytoma,the more the T/N ratio. (3)Comparison of MST indicated that the more the T/N ratio, the shorter the MST. MST in group with T/NT ratio of 1.2-2.0 was significantly longer than that in group with T/NT ratio of 4.1-(t=5.412,P< 0.001) and that in group with T/N ratio of 3.1-4.0(t=4.418,P< 0.001). MST in group of 2.1-3.0 was significantly longer than that in group of 4.1-(t=3.382, 0.002< P< 0.005) and that in group of 3.1-4.0 (t=2.389,0.02< P< 0.05). MST showed no significant difference between the group of 1.2-2.0 and the group of 2.1-3.0 (t=1.691,P >0.05), nor did between the group of 3.1-4.0 and group of 4.1-(t=1.629,P >0.05). CONCLUSION: As a noninvasive technique, (99)Tc(m)-MIBI brain SPECT is effective to diagnose brain glioma and distinguish its malignancy degree. This method, by monitoring the T/N ratio closely, is useful to discriminate tumor viability and determine the prognosis of patients.

Title: Comparison of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with glucose transporter-1 expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer.
Abstract: To clarify the biological significance of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) accumulation in patients with cancer, we assessed the relationships between 18F-FDG uptake and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and lung cancer. We obtained FDG PET images and measured standardized uptake values (SUVs) of primary tumours in 13 patients with brain glioma and 25 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. After surgery, portions of respected tumours were obtained, and the proliferation rate was measured as proliferation index (per cent of (S+G2+M)/(G0+G1+S+G2+M)) using DNA flow cytometry. The expression of GLUT-1 in a tumour was evaluated by using immunostaining. We classified GLUT-1 expression as grade 0 (no positive cell), grade 1 (< 10% cells positive), grade 2 (11-50% cells positive) and grade 3 (51-100% cells positive). Based on the expression of GLUT-1, cases with grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 showed SUVs of 6.1 +/- 2.8, 5.0 +/- 3.2, 8.3 +/- 3.3 and 10.4 +/- 6.6, respectively (P < 0.05). Non-small-cell lung cancer showed higher FDG uptake (SUV, 8.5 +/- 5.1) and higher GLUT-1 expression (grade, 2.0 +/- 1.0) than did brain glioma (SUV, 4.7 +/- 2.5; grade, 0.8 +/- 0.8). Based on the total number of cases, SUVs did not relate to proliferation index (r = 0.19). In non-small-cell lung cancer, SUVs did not correlate with proliferation index, whereas in glioma, SUVs were strongly related to proliferation index (r = 0.79, P < 0.01). In conclusion, FDG uptake generally correlated with GLUT-1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer and glioma. In the case of glioma, FDG uptake also indicated increased cellular proliferation, which was not demonstrated in non-small-cell lung cancer.

Title: Comparison of O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine PET and 3-123I-iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine SPECT in brain tumors.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare PET with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) and SPECT with 3-(123)I-iodo-alpha-methyl- L-tyrosine ((123)I-IMT) in patients with brain tumors. METHODS: Twenty patients with a suspected brain tumor were investigated by (18)F-FET PET, (123)I-IMT SPECT, and MRI within 3 wk. Region-of-interest analyses were performed on coregistered PET/SPECT/MRI images and the tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR), muscle-to-brain ratio (MBR), cerebellum-to-brain ratio (CerBR), and sinus-to-brain ratio (SBR) were calculated. In addition, the presence of tumor and the discrimination of anatomic structures on (18)F-FET PET and (123)I-IMT SPECT images were visually determined by 3 observers who were unaware of clinical data. RESULTS: The TBR of (18)F-FET and (123)I-IMT uptake in cerebral tumors showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.96; P < 0.001). In the visual analysis for the presence or absence of tumors, no differences for (123)I-IMT SPECT and (18)F-FET PET were found in 19 of 20 patients; in one patient a low-grade glioma was only identified on (18)F-FET PET images but not on (123)I-IMT SPECT images. The contrast between tumor and normal brain was significantly higher in (18)F-FET PET (TBR, 2.0 +/- 0.9) than in (123)I-IMT SPECT (TBR, 1.5 +/- 0.5). The discrimination of anatomic structures yielded a significantly better score on (18)F-FET PET images (rating score, 2.6 +/- 0.9) compared with (123)I-IMT SPECT images (rating score, 1.7 +/- 0.9). The uptake of (18)F-FET in the muscles was significantly higher compared with (123)I-IMT (MBR (18)F-FET, 1.4 +/- 0.3; MBR (123)I-IMT, 0.6 +/- 0.2; P < 0.001) and (18)F-FET demonstrated a significantly higher blood-pool radioactivity than (123)I-IMT (SBR (18)F-FET, 1.3 +/- 0.2; SBR (123)I-IMT, 0.8 +/- 0.2; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The significant correlation of the TBRs of (18)F-FET and (123)I-IMT indicates that clinical experiences of brain tumor diagnostics with (123)I-IMT SPECT might be valid for (18)F-FET PET although substantial differences of the physiologic behavior were identified in extracerebral tissue. As (18)F-FET PET allows improved discrimination of anatomic structures and the tumor-to-brain contrast was significantly superior compared with (123)I-IMT SPECT scans, the results are encouraging for further evaluation of (18)F-FET for imaging brain tumors.

Title: Acute demyelination: diagnostic difficulties and the need for brain biopsy.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid development in neuro-imaging over the past two decades, ring like contrast-enhancing lesions on CCT or MRI still may pose a diagnostic challenge. The main differential diagnoses of these lesions include metastatic carcinoma, high-grade glioma and brain abscess. Acute demyelination seldom turns out to be the underlying pathology. METHOD: Retrospective analysis was done on six patients with acute demyelination treated at our neurosurgical department between 1990 and 2001. Clinical, radiological, PET, intra-operative and histological findings were evaluated. FINDINGS: In five patients, the diagnosis of acute demyelination was established by histopathological evaluation of stereotactic biopsy specimen, in the sixth patient following microsurgical extirpation of the lesion. Neuropathology revealed demyelination with the presence of myelin-phagocytosing macrophages. In addition, lymphocytic infiltrates were present. Symptoms and signs improved significantly after high-dose steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite CNS tissue destruction, necrosis and cyst formation are not usually found in demyelinating disease, being rather more common in young patients with ring-like contrast-enhancing lesions on CCT and MRI. Though an incorrect diagnosis can lead to a potentially fatal therapeutic intervention, histological diagnosis should be made in all cases. Due to minimum morbidity, stereotactic biopsy is the method of choice to obtain representative specimens for histological diagnosis. Open microsurgery of these lesions is not indicated since conservative medical treatment with steroids results in a favourable outcome in most cases.

Title: The diagnostics of recurrent gliomas using FDG-PET: still questionable?
Abstract: BACKGROUND: For a number of years, FDG-PET was considered as a gold standard for the differential diagnosis of recurrent glioma and radionecrosis. Recently published papers have introduced a wealth of scepticism into this area. The aim of this work is to specify the added value of FDG PET, as compared to MRI, in terms of diagnostics of recurrent gliomas in the clinical setting of the PET Centre Prague. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRI and FDG-PET were used to examine 29 patients for suspicious glioma recurrence, after 30 open neurosurgical operations or re-operations combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of both examinations were calculated with respect to their micromorphological findings (n = 28) or the clinical and radiological follow-up (n = 2). RESULTS: MRI detected 23/24 tumour recurrences (sensitivity = 95.8%) and FDG PET only 15 of these (sensitivity = 62.5%). MRI specified only 3/6 radionecrotic lesions (specificity = 50.0%), while FDG PET identified 5/6 (specificity = 83.3%). Overall accuracy was 26/30 (86.7%) for MRI and 20/30 (66.7%) for FDG PET. In the subgroup of MRI positive or equivocal findings (n = 29) FDG PET was clearly positive in 15 cases. High-grade glioma recurrence was subsequently confirmed in all of them. On the other hand negative or equivocal FDG PET was associated in 5/14 cases (35.7%) with radionecrosis, in 3/14 (21.4%) with low-grade glioma and in 6/14 (42.9%) with high-grade glioma. CONCLUSIONS: MRI is the method of choice for the detection of glioma recurrence but it is associated with a high rate of false positive results. FDG PET has significantly lower sensitivity; nevertheless it does help to specify MRI positive lesions. FDG PET positive lesions give a very high probability of high-grade glioma, but its equivocal and negative findings are of no clinical value.

Title: Use of 18F-choline and 11C-choline as contrast agents in positron emission tomography imaging-guided stereotactic biopsy sampling of gliomas.
Abstract: OBJECT: Neuroimaging-guided stereotactic biopsy procedures are commonly used for diagnosis of gliomas. A number of the imaging modalities currently in use are not reliable enough in depicting these tumors. The authors developed 18F-choline and 11C-choline as tumor imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, and used them to visualize gliomas prior to stereotactic biopsy procedures. METHODS: The PET studies were performed in 12 patients who were thought to be affected by gliomas observed on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance images. The 18F- and 11C-choline were injected separately, and the PET scanning was started 5 and 20 minutes postinjection. The PET scans gave quantitative information about the distribution of 18F- and 11C-choline in the brain. The tumor uptake was constant between 5 and 20 minutes with both agents. Stereotactic biopsy sampling was performed to obtain tissues from the most radioactive areas on the PET scan; histological diagnoses were made using these tissues. The results were as follows: oligodendroglioma was found in two patients, astrocytoma in one, anaplastic astrocytoma in two, and glioblastoma in seven. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of contrast agents was always low in low-grade gliomas, and the uptake in high-grade glioma was always high. The tumor/normal (T/N) ratio of 18F-choline was 10.5:12 in anaplastic astrocytoma and 13.2:21 in glioblastoma. The 18F-choline yielded slightly superior results compared with 11C-choline with regard to the T/N ratio. In one case of oligodendroglioma the tumor showed no uptake of 18F- and 11C-choline. With this exception, the PET scans of gliomas in which 18F- and 11C-choline contrast agents were added would guide the approach to the most malignant areas for stereotactic biopsy sampling.

Title: Epilepsy surgery in infancy. A review of four cases.
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that intractable seizures in children can be eliminated or become more responsive to anticonvulsant medication after surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus or dysfunctional hemisphere. We describe our surgical experience with 4 infants treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston Hospital between 1994 and 2002. All infants, ranging in age from 5 to 9 months, presented with severe seizure disorders and failed trials of anticonvulsants. All had preoperative EEG monitoring and MRI studies; 2 had PET functional imaging. One infant underwent a temporal resection for a low-grade glioma. The rest had cortical resections for malformations and dysplasia. All had improvement, with 2 infants free of seizures off medication. We argue for early intervention in severe cases, as the potential for recovery can be dramatic.

Title: Comparison of functional brain PET images and intraoperative brain-mapping data using image-guided surgery.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Knowledge about the spatial localization of eloquent brain areas is essential for resecting lesions in the vicinity of these areas. The classical approach is to perform surgery on the awake patient under local anesthesia using brain-mapping techniques. As an alternative, the location of eloquent areas can be visualized by preoperative functional brain-imaging techniques, for example, positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using functional activation PET, both methods were combined by integration into a frameless navigation system (BrainLAB) and used to map speech-eloquent areas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Speech-eloquent areas were localized preoperatively in seven patients with a left-sided glioma using 2-[(18)F]-2-desoxy-D-glucose PET. Patients were scanned under silence conditions (i.e., with the patient remaining silent in a sound-proof cabin), and speech was activated using a verb-generation paradigm. The PET data were transferred to the neuronavigation workstation and matched with a preoperative 3D-MRI using an automatic image-fusion algorithm. Intraoperative speech localization was performed using brain-mapping techniques under local anesthesia with bipolar cortical stimulation. The stimulator position was mapped into the MRI/PET data set by neuronavigational tracking of the instrument. RESULTS: Functional PET images were integrated into the MRI-based neuronavigational system and could be transferred exactly to the operative field. By the additional integration of cortical stimulation, intraoperative electrophysiological findings can be directly compared with preoperative functional images. Seven patients with left-sided glioma were operated on using this protocol, confirming the technical feasibility. In three of seven patients, preoperative PET findings were not supported by intraoperative mapping. CONCLUSIONS: This matching and mapping technique is suitable for monitoring eloquent speech areas during surgical resection of extensive left-sided low-grade gliomas, allowing a direct comparison between intraoperative electrophysiological brain mapping and preoperative functional brain-imaging findings. The sensitivity and specificity of functional imaging techniques can now be evaluated by reconciling the data with the intraoperative stimulation results.

Title: Methyl-[11C]- l-methionine uptake as measured by positron emission tomography correlates to microvessel density in patients with glioma.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) using methyl-[(11)C]- l-methionine ([(11)C]MET) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of brain tumours. The main mechanism of [(11)C]MET uptake is probably increased transport via the L-transporter system located in the endothelial cell membrane. We used [(11)C]MET-PET and microvessel count in glioma specimens to investigate whether the increased amino acid uptake is related to angiogenesis. Twenty-one patients with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed glioma were investigated with [(11)C]MET-PET before open surgery. [(11)C]MET uptake was determined within an 8-mm region of interest in the area of the tumour showing the highest uptake, and the ratio to uptake in the corresponding contralateral region was calculated. To measure angiogenesis, immunostaining with factor VIII antibody was applied to sections from tumour tissue, and highlighted microvessels were counted in the area of highest vascularisation. In the entire patient group, a positive correlation was found between microvessel count and [(11)C]MET uptake (Spearman: r=0.89, P<0.001). This correlation was also significant in subgroups of patients [patients with grade II and III astrocytomas (Spearman: r=0.77, P<0.01) and patients with glioblastoma (Spearman: r=0.64, P<0.05)]. Angiogenesis, as assessed by microvessel count, and increased amino acid uptake, as assessed by [(11)C]MET-PET, are closely related events in gliomas. [(11)C]MET-PET offers a direct measure of amino acid transport and an indirect measure of microvessel density. [(11)C]MET-PET might be a useful tool to select potential responders to anti-angiogenic therapy and to monitor patients during such therapy.

Title: The integration of metabolic imaging in stereotactic procedures including radiosurgery: a review.
Abstract: OBJECT: The authors review their experience with the clinical development and routine use of positron emission tomography (PET) during stereotactic procedures, including the use of PET-guided gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS). METHODS: Techniques have been developed for the routine use of stereotactic PET, and accumulated experience using PET-guided stereotactic procedures over the past 10 years includes more than 150 stereotactic biopsies, 43 neuronavigation procedures, and 34 cases treated with GKS. Positron emission tomography-guided GKS was performed in 24 patients with primary brain tumors (four pilocytic astrocytomas, five low-grade astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas, seven anaplastic astrocytomas or ependymomas, five glioblastomas, and three neurocytomas), five patients with metastases (single or multiple lesions), and five patients with pituitary adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained with PET scanning can be integrated with GKS treatment planning, enabling access to metabolic information with high spatial accuracy. Positron emission tomography data can be successfully combined with magnetic resonance imaging data to provide specific information for defining the target volume for the radiosurgical treatment in patients with recurrent brain tumors, such as glioma, metastasis, and pituitary adenoma. This approach is particularly useful for optimizing target selection for infiltrating or ill-defined brain lesions. The use of PET scanning contributed data in 31 cases (93%) and information that was specifically utilized to adapt the target volume in 25 cases (74%). It would seem that the integration of PET data into GKS treatment planning may represent an important step toward further developments in radiosurgery: this approach provides additional information that may open new perspectives for the optimization of the treatment of brain tumors.

Title: 18F-FDG and 11C-methionine PET in choroid plexus papilloma--report of three cases.
Abstract: Choroid plexus papilloma (CCP) is an uncommon benign neoplasm of the neuroectoderm. We present the 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and 11C-methyl-L-methionine (methionine) positron emission tomography of CPP in comparison with that of low-grade glioma. Patients were two women and one man (20, 23, and 72 years old). The Ki-67 labeling index ranged from 0.98 to 2.22%, and histologically the cases belonged to grade 2. On quantitative analysis, the tumor/normal ratio (T/N) was calculated using the standardized uptake value. Methionine T/N was significantly higher in CPP (3.24+/-0.69) than in low-grade glioma (1.23+/-0.81; p<0.01), although no clear difference could be determined for FDG T/N between the two (0.87+/-0.39, 0.75+/-0.53). These results may suggest that the metabolism of amino acid in CPP is quite different from that in low-grade glioma.

Title: Positron emission tomography with injection of methionine as a prognostic factor in glioma.
Abstract: OBJECT: Positron emission tomography with L-[methyl-11C]methionine (MET-PET) provides information on the metabolism of gliomas. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of MET-PET in the treatment of patients with gliomas. METHODS: Since 1992, 85 patients with a World Health Organization (WHO) classification-verified glioma underwent PET studies in which MET was injected before (74 cases) or after treatment (11 cases). Analysis of PET data was conducted by the same investigator using two scales: a qualitative visual grading scale and a quantitative scale (ratio between tumor uptake and normal brain uptake, classified on a seven-level scale). Uptake of MET was present in 98% of gliomas. The investigator judged this uptake to be moderate to very high based on visual inspection (qualitative scale). For all grades of gliomas, a visual grade of 3 was statistically associated with a shorter patient survival period (p < 0.005). The tumor/normal brain uptake ratio was significantly influenced by the histological grade of the tumor. A statistically poor outcome was demonstrated when this ratio was higher than a threshold of 2.2 for a WHO Grade II tumor and 2.8 for WHO Grade III tumor. For Grade II and III tumors, oligodendrogliomas had a higher uptake of MET than astrocytomas. CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of MET was present in 98% of the gliomas studied. A high uptake is statistically associated with a poor survival time. The intensity of MET uptake represents a prognostic factor for WHO Grade II and III tumors considered separately.

Title: FDG-PET as a prognostic factor in high-grade astrocytoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of the metabolic status of cerebral gliomas determined by positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) has been established in populations with a mixture of grades 2, 3 and 4 gliomas, but remains uncertain when only malignant gliomas are considered (grade 3 and 4). METHODS: FDG-PET performed in 30 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and 61 patients with glioblastoma (grade 4) were classified according to a metabolic grading. The uptake of FDG was lower in the tumor compared to white matter (WM) in grade 1 (4 glioblastoma, 4 anaplastic astrocytoma), it was intermediate between WM and cortex in grade 2 (20 glioblastoma, 22 anaplastic astrocytoma), and it was superior to cortex in grade 3 (38 glioblastoma, 4 anaplastic astrocytoma). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves were similar in patient with grades 1 and 2, but were significantly worse (p = 0.007) in grade 3. In multivariate analysis considering age, pathological grade (anaplastic astrocytoma versus glioblastoma), and metabolic grades, the metabolic grade did not appear to be an independent prognostic factor. When anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas were considered separately, metabolic grade is of predictive value only in the group of glioblastomas. CONCLUSION: In malignant gliomas, metabolic grading determined by FDG-PET was not superior to the pathological grading for survival prediction. Still, it remains of predictive value when applied to malignant gliomas histologically classified as glioblastoma.

Title: Evaluation of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma by use of positron emission tomography with.
Abstract: We present a case of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) in a patient with temporal lobe seizures. Imaging sequences included MR, and results of positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [11C]-methionine (Met) tracers revealed a hypermetabolic region equivalent or nearly equivalent to normal cerebral cortex, suggesting that the tumor might have malignant potential. Histopathologic findings indicated low-grade glioma. The mechanism for glucose hypermetabolic activity of PXA is not clear; however, the positive findings obtained from FDG-PET may not always indicate the degree of malignancy associated with PXA.

Title: Radiotherapy treatment planning and long-term follow-up with [(11)C]methionine PET in patients with low-grade astrocytoma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of [(11)C]-methionine positron emission tomography (MET PET) in radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning and long-term follow-up in patients with low-grade glioma. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with low-grade astrocytoma and 1 with anaplastic astrocytoma underwent sequential MET PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and 3, 6, 12, and 21-39 months after RT, respectively. Ten patients were studied after initial debulking surgery or biopsy and 4 in the recurrence phase. METHODS: A total of 58 PET scans were performed. After transmission scanning, a median dose of 425 MBq of MET was injected intravenously and emission data was acquired 20 min after injection for 20 min. The uptake of MET in tumor area was measured as standardized uptake value (SUV) and tumor-to-contralateral brain SUV ratios were generated to assess irradiation effects on tumor metabolism. Functional imaging with PET was compared with concurrent MRI in designing the RT planning volumes and in assessment of response to RT during a median follow-up time of 33 months. RESULTS: In 12 patients (86%), tumor area was clearly discernible in the baseline PET study. In the remaining 2 patients with a suspected residual tumor in MRI, PET showed only a diffuse uptake of MET interpreted as negative in the original tumor area. In the dose planning of RT, MET PET was helpful in outlining the gross tumor volume in 3 of 11 cases (27%), whereas PET findings either coincided with MRI (46%) or were less distinctive (27%) in other cases. In quantitative evaluation, patients with a low tumor SUV initially had significantly better prognosis than those with a high SUV. Tumor-to-contralateral brain uptake ratios of MET discriminated well patients remaining clinically stable from those who have since relapsed or died of disease. CONCLUSION: Quantitative MET PET has prognostic value at the time of initial treatment planning of low-grade glioma. Some patients may benefit of RT volume definition with MET PET, which seems to disclose residual tumor better than MRI in selected cases. Stable or decreasing uptake of MET in tumor area after RT during follow-up seems to be a favorable sign.

Title: Evaluation of early response to SU101 target-based therapy in patients with recurrent supratentorial malignant gliomas using FDG PET and Gd-DTPA MRI.
Abstract: Changes in [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) enhancement before and after the first course of treatment with a cytostatic agent SU101 (N-[(4-trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamide, SUGEN) were assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a pilot study of 8 patients with recurrent supratentorial malignant gliomas. The localization and the volume of Gd-DTPA enhancement and FDG hypermetabolism were analyzed. PET and MRI studies were performed one week before and 7.6+/-3.7 weeks after administration of SU101. The ratios of mean tumor activity to mean contralateral white matter and ipsilateral cerebellar activity were calculated for tumor regions, and SUV values corrected to the subjects' body surface area and glucose level (SUVbsa*glu) were calculated for nontumor regions. Five patients had a substantial increase of tumor volume on both PET and MRI during the first course of SU101. PET and MRI showed roughly equivalent volume changes. Large tumor volume increases were associated with a short time to clinical progression. The metabolic change in the tumor following the first course of SU101 varied from patient to patient, ranging from a 31% reduction to a 43% increase in FDG uptake ratio. Changes in FDG uptake were not predictive of time to progression or survival. In 2 patients with marked clinical deterioration and rapid tumor growth, there were differences in localization of Gd-DTPA enhancement and FDG hypermetabolism suggesting that hypermetabolism beyond the area of contrast enhancement may be of value in predicting rapid progression of high-grade glioma. SU101 did not induce any appreciable changes in SUVbsa*glu for non-tumor brain in 6 of 8 patients.

Title: Evaluation of the malignancy of glioma using 11C-methionine positron emission tomography and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining.
Abstract: 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining were performed in 13 cases of glioma to investigate the relationship between the uptake of L-[methyl]-11C-methionine and the degree of malignancy and proliferative potential. The 11C-methionine uptake was significantly greater in high-grade gliomas compared to low-grade gliomas (P<0.05). The PCNA indexes were also significantly higher in the high-grade cases (P<0.05). Moreover, a strong positive correlation was found between the 11C-methionine values and the PCNA indexes (P<0.005), demonstrating that higher 11C-methionine uptake was associated with greater proliferative potential and greater malignancy. 11C-methionine PET is a potentially useful preoperative method to discriminate the malignancy of glioma.

Title: Imaging brain tumor proliferative activity with [124I]iododeoxyuridine.
Abstract: Iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) uptake and retention was imaged by positron emission tomography (PET) at 0-48 min and 24 h after administration of 28.0-64.4 MBq (0.76-1.74 mCi) of [124I]IUdR in 20 patients with brain tumors, including meningiomas and gliomas. The PET images were directly compared with gadolinium contrast-enhanced or T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Estimates for IUdR-DNA incorporation in tumor tissue (Ki) required pharmacokinetic modeling and fitting of the 0-48 min dynamically acquired data to correct the 24-h image data for residual, nonincorporated radioactivity that did not clear from the tissue during the 24-h period after IUdR injection. Standard uptake values (SUVs) and tumor:brain activity ratios (Tm:Br) were also calculated from the 24-h image data. The Ki, SUV, and Tm/Br values were related to tumor type and grade, tumor labeling index, and survival after the PET scan. The plasma half-life of [124I]IUdR was short (2-3 min), and the arterial plasma input function was similar between patients (48 +/- 12 SUV*min). Plasma clearance of the major radiolabeled metabolite ([124I]iodide) varied somewhat between patients and was markedly prolonged in one patient with renal insufficiency. It was apparent from our analysis that a sizable fraction (15-93%) of residual nonincorporated radioactivity (largely [124I]iodide) remained in the tumors after the 24-h washout period, and this fraction varied between the different tumor groups. Because the SUV and Tm:Br ratio values reflect both IUdR-DNA incorporated and exchangeable nonincorporated radioactivity, any residual nonincorporated radioactivity will amplify their values and distort their significance and interpretation. This was particularly apparent in the meningioma and glioblastoma multiforme groups of tumors. Mean tumor Ki values ranged between 0.5 +/- 0.9 (meningiomas) and 3.9 +/- 2.3 microl/min/g (peak value for glioblastoma multiforme, GBM). Comparable SUV and Tm:Br values at 24 h ranged from 0.13 +/- 0.03 to 0.29 +/- 0.19 and from 2.0 +/- 0.6 to 6.1 +/- 1.5 for meningiomas and peak GBMs, respectively. Thus, the range of values was much greater for Ki (approximately 8-fold) compared with that for SUV (approximately 2.2-fold) and Tm:Br (approximately 3-fold). The expected relationships between Ki, SUV, and Tm:Br and other measures of tumor proliferation (tumor type and grade, labeling index, and patient survival) were observed. However, greater image specificity and significance of the SUV and Tm:Br values would be obtained by achieving greater washout and clearance of the exchangeable fraction of residual (background) radioactivity in the tumors, i.e., by increased hydration and urinary clearance and possibly by imaging later than 24 h after [124I]IUdR administration.

Title: [Evaluation of the nature of brain tumors using methods of nuclear medicine].
Abstract: FDG-PET studies permit an assessment of the degree of brain tumour malignancy and detection of tumour recurrence. MIBI-SPECT also affords promising results in this respect. In this work, the diagnostic value of MIBI-SPECT was compared with that of FDG-PET for the determination of primary brain tumours malignancy and the detection of recurrent brain tumours. SPECT and PET examination were carried out within a week in 14 patients (12 males, 2 females, mean age: 40 years, range 16-61 years) with brain tumours. Seven patients had a primary tumour, and in a further 7 MRI or the clinical signs and symptoms let to a suspicion of tumour recurrence. All tumours were verified histologically to be gliomas of grades I-IV. The SPECT and PET images were analysed visually and semiquantitatively. In 3 of the investigated 7 primary glioma patients, there was a visibly enhanced MIBI-positive cases, only one had an increased FDG uptake. In 4 of the 7 tumour recurrence cases, either the MIBI or the FDG uptake was visibly increased. All of these were histologically high-grade gliomas. In the remaining low grade tumours (primary of recurrent), neither MIBI nor FDG revealed a pathologically increased uptake. The intensity of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the site of the tumours was visually and semiquantitatively higher for MIBI that for FDG. It is concluded that MIBI-SPECT is a valuable and simple tool for evaluation of the biological characteristics of brain tumours, showing increased uptake of MIBI according to the malignancy and tumour recurrence of brain tumours.

Title: Monitoring tumor activity in low grade glioma of childhood.
Abstract: Chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic regimens are being increasingly used in low grade glioma of childhood. These protocols require methods to monitor tumor activity. We report our experience in eleven patients. The tumors were localized in the optic pathway (3), cerebral cortex (4) and thalamus/hypothalamus (4). Histological diagnoses included low grade astrocytoma (6), gliofibroma (1) and ganglioglioma (2). Two children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and typical optical tumors were not biopsied. 13 episodes of progression were noted including 3 altered diagnoses. This was evident from clinical symptoms in 11/13 episodes, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 10/13 situations, iodine-123-alpha-methyltyrosine (123I-IMT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 10/10 situations, fluorine-18 fluorodesoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in 0/3 and thallium-201 (201Tl) SPECT in 1/1. Seven responses to chemotherapy were recorded. Clinical symptoms indicated this in 7/7 situations, MRI in 5/7, 123I-IMT SPECT in 1/2 and 201Tl SPECT in 1/1. These data suggest that 123I-IMT SPECT is a valuable addition to low grade glioma diagnostic and stress the need for a prospective study.

Title: A comparative study of thallium-201 SPET, carbon-11 methionine PET and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the differentiation of astrocytic tumours.
Abstract: Thallium-201, carbon-11 methionine (MET) and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) have all been used to assess brain tumours. The aim of this study was to determine which of these tracers are of use for evaluating the histological grade and the extent of astrocytoma. 201Tl single-photon emission tomography (SPET), MET positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG PET were all performed in 23 patients (13 men, 10 women) with newly diagnosed astrocytic tumours [seven with astrocytoma (grade II), ten with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and six with glioblastoma (grade IV)]. The 201Tl uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a lesion-to-normal region count ratio. Both MET and FDG uptake of the tumours was evaluated by a semiquantitative analysis using the standardized uptake value. 201Tl uptake was found to increase in rank order with histological grade and was significantly different among the three groups (grade II: 1.51+/-0.36; grade III: 2.58+/-1.50; grade IV: 7. 65+/-3.84). MET uptake in grade II (1.49+/-0.44) was also significantly lower than that in both grade III (3.29+/-1.44) and grade IV (3.20+/-0.92). FDG uptake was not significantly different among the three groups (grade II: 2.90+/-0.45; grade III: 3.86+/-1. 56; grade IV: 3.57+/-0.83). No significant correlation was observed between 201Tl uptake and either MET uptake or FDG uptake. In most patients, the extent of the increased MET uptake was the largest while that of the increased FDG uptake was the smallest. In patients with positive 201Tl uptake, the extent of the 201Tl uptake was equal to or smaller than that of gadolinium enhancement. For evaluation of histological grade of astrocytic tumours. 201Tl is therefore considered to be useful though the 201Tl uptake in some grade III astrocytomas was not different from that in grade II astrocytomas. MET was found to be highly useful for detecting astrocytomas, for differentiating between benign and malignant astrocytomas, and for evaluating the extent of astrocytomas; however, it was not sufficiently useful permit evaluation of the histological grade. FDG was not found to be useful either for evaluating the histological grade or for differentiating between benign and malignant astrocytomas.

Title: The value of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the 3-D radiation treatment planning of malignant gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of positron emission tomography using the glucose analogue fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) on the delineation of the target volume in three-dimensional radiation treatment planning of primary brain tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 18 patients with histologically proven (8x biopsy, 10x subtotal resection) primary brain tumors (8 astrocytomas grade III, one mixed glioma grade III, and 9 glioblastomas), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA and FDG-PET were performed in radiation treatment position within the same week. A computer program was developed for fusion of the PET and MR images. On corresponding axial slices, FDG uptake was compared to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted and to signal hyperintensity in T2-weighted MR images. Based on PET and MRI data, three-dimensional treatment planning was performed. All patients underwent linear accelerator (LINAC) radiotherapy. RESULTS: In MRI, all tumors and the surrounding edema were visible as hyperintense lesions in the T2-weighted images. 17/18 tumors showed contrast enhancement. In FDG-PET, 16 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal white matter, whereas only 8/18 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal gray matter. White matter edema was associated with decreased FDG uptake in all patients. The area of increased FDG uptake correlated closely with contrast enhancement, only in one case the volume of increased FDG uptake was larger than the area of contrast enhancement. Mean tumor volumes obtained by MRI T1 + Gd, T2, and PET were 30, 106, and 10 ml, respectively. Survival was comparable to data in the literature with a 1-year survival of 39% and a median survival of 310 days. CONCLUSION: Only in a minority of patients did FDG-PET provide additional information for radiation treatment planning. This is mainly caused by the high intensity of FDG uptake in normal brain tissue. PET may be of greater value in the definition of regions that should obtain a radiation dose boost.

Title: [High uptake on 11C methionine PET scan in the pituitary gland of a patient with cerebral glioma after surgical abortion].
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with various tracers provides physiologic and biochemical information of living organs. Since radiologic examinations are usually avoided in pregnant women, mainly because of the radiation risk to the fetus, little is known about the effect of pregnancy on cerebral blood flow and metabolism. This paper reports findings of a 11C methionine PET scan of the pituitary gland in a woman after an abortion. The patient was a 31-year-old woman who suffered a seizure in the 9th week of her second pregnancy. On admission, computed tomography showed an abnormal mass lesion in the right frontal lobe, and a brain tumor was suspected. The patient and her family asked that that pregnancy be terminated. Seven days after a surgical abortion, methionine PET was performed. The scan showed high methionine uptake in the pituitary gland as well as in the right frontal lobe tumor. We suspected that another tumor was present in the pituitary gland. The right frontal tumor was partially resected, and pathologic examination of the resected specimen showed an astrocytoma (grade 2). After the operation, the patient received 50 Gy irradiation and chemotherapy. Two months after the operation, we performed a second methionine PET scan, which showed high uptake in the residual right frontal tumor but not in the pituitary gland. Results of other radiologic studies of the pituitary gland were normal. These findings suggest that the transport of 11C methionine into the pituitary gland may increase during pregnancy. Moreover, the pituitary gland of pregnancy should be a part of the differential diagnosis of pituitary adenomas in PET scanning. The change in physiologic uptake by the female pituitary gland should be taken into account in the diagnosis of pituitary adenoma with methionine PET.

Title: Radiosynthesis and quality assurance of 5-[124I]Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine for functional PET imaging of cell proliferation.
Abstract: 5-[124I]Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ([124I]IUdR) was routinely produced by direct electrophilic labelling of 2'-deoxyuridine with 124I of high specific activity (12 Ci/micromol) in an Iodogen-coated ReactiVial, followed by purification on a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge. The radiochemical purity was determined by TLC on a Silicagel-60 plate and by reverse-phase HPLC on a RP-18 column. Based upon 45 syntheses, the yield ranged from 45% to 65%. The radiochemical impurity of [124I]IUdR was determined at 2.9% by TLC (mainly iodate) and 4.3% by HPLC. The chemical stability of the solvated formulation allowed a time window of 2 days following end of synthesis (EOS) for chemical application, based upon the required 95% radiochemical purity grade of [124I]IUdR. The labelled compound was routinely used for the clinical determination of cell proliferation in glioma patients by positron emission tomography.

Title: Assessment of malignancy of glioma by positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and single photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 chloride.
Abstract: The histological diagnosis and proliferative potential measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling index (LI) were correlated with preoperative CT and contrast-enhanced, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and 201T1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 43 patients with various grades of glioma. 201T1 SPECT had slightly higher sensitivity to tumours with BrdU LI > or = 5% (showing 10/10) than 18F-FDG PET (7/8 tumours). 18F-FDG PET was better for identifying tumours of BrdU LI < 1% (13/15) than 201T1 SPECT (13/22). Accumulation of 201T1 in the tumour was slightly different from contrast enhancement on CT and/or MRI, and gave "false-positive" results in some low-grade gliomas. However, 201T1 SPECT, which is available in many hospitals and may cost less, provided useful information to supplement that from CT and MRI.

Title: Fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine PET in patients with glioma.
Abstract: We synthesized fluorine-18-labeled fluoroboronophenylalanine (18F-10B-FBPA), an analog of boronophenylalanine (10B-BPA), and characterized its pharmacokinetics in patients with glioma. We conducted PET studies on three types of gliomas to clarify the relationship between tumor grade and each rate constant [K1 (ml/g/min), k2 (min[-1]) and k3 (min[-1])], and here, we discuss the metabolism of the 10B-BPA analog (18F-10B-FBPA). METHODS: Thirty-three cases of primary gliomas were studied by dynamic PET using DL-18F-10B-FBPA or L-18F-10B-FBPA. Dynamic PET images of 18F-10B-FBPA incorporation into tumors were obtained, and the arterial blood samplings were performed in all cases. RESULTS: When the dynamic PET data were represented as Gjedde-Patlak plots, there was a positive slope, suggesting the involvement of the putative metabolic pool of this tracer. A three-compartment model using rate constants (K1, k2 and k3) was used for the kinetic analysis. The accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA was found to correlate with the degree of malignancy, and the L form of 18F-10B-FBPA was taken up better than was the DL form. The results of dynamic PET analysis suggested that K1 (measuring amino acid transport process) is a major factor determining the accumulation of 18F-10B-FBPA. A comparison of the rate constants revealed that k3 (metabolic process) did not correlate with the degree of malignancy. The absence of evident differences in k3 between DL and L forms suggests that k3 represents phenomena that are not dependent on the native form of L. CONCLUSION: These PET data will be of practical use for diagnosis of malignancy and direct prediction of the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy using 10B-BPA.

Title: Non-invasive investigations successfully select patients for temporal lobe surgery.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: There is controversy regarding the need for invasive monitoring in the preoperative assessment of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The use of a series of non-invasive investigations in identifying the seizure focus is reported in 75 consecutive adults referred for epilepsy surgery. METHODS: All had video-EEG monitoring using scalp electrodes, high resolution MRI, and neuropsychology assessment. Other investigations included volumetric MRI, PET, and ictal and interictal SPECT. The seizure focus was localised and surgery offered if MRI disclosed unilateral hippocampal atrophy or a foreign tissue lesion and other investigations were either concordant or not discordant. RESULTS: In 68 patients the seizure focus was localised and three patients were inoperable. Sixty five patients have been offered surgery and 50 have undergone temporal lobe surgery and have a follow up of at least 12 months (mean 24 months). All had pathology: hippocampal sclerosis 34, dysembryoblastic neuroepithelial tumour six, cavernoma four, dysplasia two, low grade glioma two, ganglioglioma two. Thirty nine patients (78%) are seizure free postoperatively, 29/34 with hippocampal sclerosis and 10/16 with a foreign tissue lesion. Of the 11 patients with postoperative recurrent seizures, eight have a >90% reduction in seizure frequency and three have <90% reduction in seizure frequency but a worthwhile improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive investigations successfully select most patients for temporal lobe surgery.

Title: Three-dimensional imaging of cortical structure, function and glioma for tumor resection.
Abstract: A three-dimensional brain imaging protocol with PET and MRI was used to visualize the cortical structure in relation to brain function and glioma infiltration to determine tumor resectability. METHODS: Sixteen patients with glioma had a PET scan with 11C-methionine to visualize tumor infiltration. The PET images were co-registered to the patients' own MRI reconstructed to the three-dimensional brain surface images to indicate the gyral structure and the extent of tumor infiltration. Thirteen patients, who bore tumors adjacent to the language or motor cortex, had H2 15O activation study to locate the eloquent cortex. The area of tumor infiltration was superimposed on the brain surface images together with the language and/or motor cortex. RESULTS: When a tumor was located within a single gyrus without influencing surface cortical gyrus pattern, the motor and language areas were identified morphologically by three-dimensional surface image alone. However, when the tumor caused swelling and deformation of cortical structure, functional mapping with H2(15)O activation technique was essential in locating them correctly. In such cases, the combined mapping of the facial motor area with oral movement and the language area with word repetition was the most useful method to identify the parasylvian structure in the dominant hemisphere. Total or near total resection of low-grade glioma in eight patients and the effective decompression of the active part of the malignant glioma in four patients was completed without causing functional neurological deterioration. CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional expression of cortical structure and function combined with PET glioma imaging with 11C-methionine is useful for radical resection of cerebral glioma.

Title: Regional methionine and glucose uptake in high-grade gliomas: a comparative study on PET-guided stereotactic biopsy.
Abstract: Gliomas are regionally heterogeneous tumors. The local relationship between histologic features and radiotracer uptake evaluated by PET should therefore influence analysis and interpretation of PET results on gliomas. This study explored this local relationship as a result of PET guidance of stereotactic biopsies. METHODS: Local histology was confronted to the regional uptake of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and 11C-methionine (11C-MET) in 14 patients with high-grade glioma diagnosed during a procedure of PET-guided stereotactic biopsies. We analyzed the uptake of both tracers in regions of interest centered on the stereotactic coordinates of 93 biopsy samples. RESULTS: A semiquantitative analysis revealed a significant regional correlation between 11C-MET and 18F-FDG uptakes. Uptake of both tracers was significantly higher on the site of tumor samples showing anaplastic changes than in the rest of the tumor. Presence of necrosis in anaplastic areas of the tumor significantly reduced the uptake of 11C-MET. CONCLUSION: PET with 11C-MET and 18F-FDG may help to evaluate, in vivo, the metabolic heterogeneity of human gliomas. Anaplasia is a factor of increased uptake of both tracers, but microscopic necrosis in anaplastic areas influences their uptake differently. This finding probably relates to the differences in tracer uptake by non-neoplastic components of necrotic tumors. These results underline the complementary role of 18F-FDG and 11C-MET for the study of brain tumors and favors their use for stereotactic PET guidance of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

Title: 11C-methionine and 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a tool for diagnosis of cerebral glioma and monitoring after brachytherapy with 125I seeds.
Abstract: Forty-six patients with suspected brain tumors were investigated by positron emission tomography (PET). Using 11C-methionine PET, the spatial extent of increased uptake in gliomas was larger than that of contrast enhancement on CT/MR images in 67% or the same in 33%. Ten of 46 patients treated with brachytherapy for low-grade gliomas were also investigated with 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. One year after seed implantation, the glucose metabolism had not changed, but the decline of methionine uptake was significant. In conclusion, 11C-methionine PET may improve tumor delineation and, following brachytherapy, provides more information on the therapeutic effects than FDG.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: After intensive initial radiation therapy for malignant glioma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) cannot distinguish tumor progression from radiation injury. METHODS: The authors studied the prognostic value of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in 55 patients with malignant glioma for whom MRI obtained after initial surgery and radiation therapy demonstrated enlarging, enhancing lesions consistent with either tumor progression or radiation necrosis. Forty patients (73%) had an initial diagnosis of Grade 4 malignant glioma and 15 (27%) had Grade 3 malignant glioma. The FDG-PET scans were graded visually on a four-level scale at the time of acquisition. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the FDG-PET score was a significant predictor of survival time after FDG-PET scanning (P = 0.005). Median survival was 10 months for patients with FDG-PET scores of 2 or 3 (glucose uptake > or = adjacent cortex) and 20 months for those with scores of 0 or 1 (glucose uptake < adjacent cortex). In multivariate proportional hazards analysis, the FDG-PET score was a significant predictor of survival (P = 0.019) in a model that included patient age, recurrence number, and FDG-PET score. There was no significant difference in the FDG-PET score hazard ratio for patients with Grade 3 or 4 tumors at initial diagnosis, first or later suspected recurrence, initial photon irradiation given with standard fractions or hyperfractionation, or stereotactic irradiation prior to FDG-PET scanning. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that FDG-PET scanning has prognostic value in a cohort limited to patients with suspected recurrent high grade glioma.

Title: Quantitative evaluation of neutral amino acid transport in cerebral gliomas using positron emission tomography and fluorine-18 fluorophenylalanine.
Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism of large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transport in cerebral gliomas and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorophenylalanine (18F-Phe), we examined 18 patients with cerebral glioma using dynamic PET and 18F-Phe. By employing two-compartment model analysis, the influx rate K1, the efflux rate k2 and the distribution volume (Vd) of 18F-Phe were estimated in tumour tissue and contralateral normal grey matter. 18F-Phe showed increased accumulation in tumour tissue regardless of the grade of malignancy in all patients. The rate of uptake of 18F-Phe in high-grade glioma was significantly higher than in low-grade glioma (P <0.05). However, it was difficult to evaluate the tumour grade only from the 18F-Phe accumulation in individual cases. Values of K1 and Vd were significantly increased in the tumour tissue. The K1 value of the tumour tissue tended to decrease with increasing LNAA concentration in plasma. Therefore, influx of 18F-Phe into tumour tissue is mainly related to the carrier-mediated active transport. It is concluded that PET with 18F-Phe is of clinical value for tumour detection rather than assessment of tumour malignancy.

Title: F-Dopa as an amino acid tracer to detect brain tumors.
Abstract: A 57-yr-old woman suffering from light movement disorder of the left arm and hand was referred for 18F-Dopa PET. The PET study not only proved asymmetrically reduced dopamine uptake in the putamen (influx constant Ki right 0.0064/min, left 0.0086) but also revealed pathologically increased 18F-Dopa accumulation in the right frontal lobe. Further PET examinations demonstrated increased 11C-methionine uptake and low glucose metabolism in this right frontal region. MRI and 1H-MRSI showed a heterogeneous lesion with reduced N-acetyl-aspartate and increased choline and lactate, suggesting a mixed, low-grade glioma. In 15O-water studies, during intentional movements of one hand the respective motor areas were identified, indicating asymmetries due to the mass occupying lesion. The tumor could be removed in open surgery, thus sparing the motor areas; a mild postoperative motor deficit resolved to the presurgical state. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a grade 2 oligo-astrocytoma. This case impressively demonstrates that 18F-Dopa can be used as an amino acid tracer for brain tumor detection in addition to its established application to assess aromatic acid decarboxylase activity.

Title: [Clinical value of positron emission tomography (PET) in oncologic questions: results of an interdisciplinary consensus conference. Schirmerreschaft der Deutschen Gesellschaft for Nuklearmedizin].
Abstract: AIM: The purpose of the present paper is to assess clinical value of PET in oncology on the basis of published studies. METHODS: Clinical value of PET in oncology was evaluated by a panel of recognized experts in the framework of an interdisciplinary consensus conference. On the basis of PET studies, well documented in the international literature, the value of PET for solving clinical questions was classified according to the following categories (classes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3): "appropriate" (1a), "mostly acceptable" (1b), "helpful" (2a), "value as yet unknown" (2b), "useless" (3). RESULTS: 2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) acts as the radiopharmaceutical of choice for PET in clinical oncology. PET is indicated (1a) for diagnosing relapse in high grade glioma (FDG) or low grade glioma (C-11 methionine or F-18 fluorotyrosine), differential diagnosis of solitary peripheral pulmonary nodules in high risk patients and for diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. PET may be clinically used (1b): In "low-grade" glioma, search for unknown primary in head and neck tumors, suspicion of relapse in non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (NSCBC) and colorectal carcinoma, lymphnode staging in NSCBC, pancreatic carcinoma, muscle invasive bladder carcinoma and testicular cancer. Staging of Hodgkin's disease (HD, stage I/II vs III), early therapy control in patients with a residual mass or suspicion of relapse in HD and in high grade NHL, lymph node staging and search for distant metastases in malignant melanoma (Breslow > 1.5 mm), search for lymph node or distant metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer with elevated hTG and a negative radioiodide whole body scan. Many further indications are emerging, but are not yet sufficiently well documented in the literature. For most indications beside scientific studies, an individual cost benefit utility evaluation by the responsible physician is recommended. CONCLUSION: Metabolic imaging of PET provides for many principle advantages compared to conventional anatomically based cross sectional imaging. For routine use in oncology a detailed assessment of specific efficiency of PET is indicated.

Title: Independent thallium-201 accumulation and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in glioma.
Abstract: SPECT with 201TI is an effective procedure for evaluating the malignancy of glioma. Our goal was to investigate the diagnostic relevance of both 201TI SPECT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and the relation between 201TI uptake and glucose metabolism in glioma using comparative SPECT and PET studies. METHODS: Thallium-201 SPECT and FDG dynamic PET studies were performed in 20 patients with untreated glioma (5 with glioblastoma, 5 with anaplastic glioma, 10 with low-grade glioma). Thallium-201 uptake in the tumor was estimated using the 201TI index, defined as the ratio of 201TI uptake in the tumor to that in the contralateral normal brain on SPECT images obtained 15 min after intravenous injection. We measured regional glucose metabolic parameters, including rate constants and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (rCMRgl), in the tumor. We then compared the regional 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters with the histologic characteristics, malignancy and computed tomographic/ magnetic resonance imaging findings. In addition, we investigated the correlation between the 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters. RESULTS: Thallium-201 SPECT showed abnormal 201TI uptake in all patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic glioma. Thallium-201 indices of glioblastoma (202.6 +/- 22.1%) and anaplastic glioma (176.6% +/- 26.6%) were significantly higher than that for low-grade glioma (106.7% +/- 13.8%). The rCMRgl value of glioblastoma (17.6 +/- 3.5 mumole/100 g/min) was also significantly higher than that for low-grade glioma (10.8 +/- 4.5 mumole/100 g/min), although rCMRgl showed a large variability in both high- and low-grade glioma. Rate constants of FDG kinetics had no correlation with histological grade of glioma. Some patients with high-grade glioma, however, showed false-negative results with FDG-PET because of high normal brain uptake of FDG. Conversely, most low-grade glioma could not be localized by 201TI SPECT. There was no correlation between the 201TI index and glucose metabolic parameters. CONCLUSION: Thallium-201 indices and rCMRgl values for glioblastoma were higher than those for low-grade glioma. Thallium-201 uptake in the tumor may be independent of increased glucose transport or metabolism. Thallium-201 SPECT and FDG-PET are complementary in the diagnosis of glioma, although 201TI SPECT is more significantly correlated with the malignancy of glioma.

Title: Clinical positron emission tomography for brain tumors: comparison of fludeoxyglucose F 18 and L-methyl-11C-methionine.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences between fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) and L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-methionine) as tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation of brain tumors. METHODS: We analyzed 10 patients with histologically verified cerebral glioma or meningioma and 1 patient with a neuroradiologic diagnosis of low-grade glioma by using FDG, 11C-methionine, and PET. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent and degree of accumulation of FDG and 11C-methionine in the tumor tissue. RESULTS: Although PET with FDG depicted malignant tumors as a hot spot in all cases, it was not able to delineate the extent of the tumor. Conversely, PET with 11C-methionine outlined the tumors as areas of increased accumulation of 11C-methionine, regardless of the degree of malignancy. CONCLUSION: PET with FDG and with 11C-methionine can play complementary roles in the evaluation of brain tumors.

Title: [Positron-emission tomography: role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) imaging in oncology].
Abstract: There is a renewed interest in positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) since the development of large field of view cameras and the capability of regional distribution of 18FDG. This method may help solve three types of problems in clinical oncology: tumor diagnosis and extension assessment, prediction of treatment response and follow-up (diagnosis of recurrences and complications). The aim of this paper is to review the literature in this field. This technique is mostly used for brain, lung, rectal and breast tumors as well as for sarcomas. It is possible to diagnose an anaplastic transformation of a low grade glioma since 18FDG uptake correlates with the histological grade. 18FDG plays another important role in the evaluation of the brain tumor response to treatment and of the secondary effects or sequelae of this treatment. This technique is also useful in breast carcinomas: diagnosis in the case of a dense breast, detection of lymph nodes or other metastases which could modify the strategy. One of the most established roles of 18FDG PET is the diagnosis of rectal tumor recurrences. Furthermore, future results will probably confirm its usefulness in lung carcinoma, for the diagnosis and for treatment evaluation. Lastly, it plays an important role in soft tissue sarcomas at all stages of diagnosis and treatment. The results of the literature still have to be completed. However, if the capability of predicting tumor response to treatment is confirmed, this method will play an important role in patient management and will modify treatment strategies.

Title: Clinical application of 18F-FUdR in glioma patients--PET study of nucleic acid metabolism.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography was used to investigate the metabolism of nucleic acids by 18F-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (18F-FUdR) in 22 patients with gliomas. Sixteen cases of high grade glioma clearly demonstrated a region of high activity with a differential absorption rate (DAR) of 0.64 +/- 0.34. Six cases of low grade glioma failed to reveal a positive image of the tumor and the DAR in tumor was 0.21 +/- 0.042 (p < 0.01). This PET-18F-FUdR study succeeded in differentiating high and low grade gliomas from the view point of nucleic acid metabolism.

Title: Thallium-201 SPECT and positron emission tomography equal predictors of glioma grade and recurrence.
Abstract: Quantitative indexes based on regions of interest ratios from preoperative thallium-201 SPECT and F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were compared for their ability to predict the histological grade of cerebral gliomas. Of the five different ratios used to determine the index for each PET scan, the ratio of tumour versus ipsilateral hemisphere in the same plane as the tumour showed the most significant correlation with glioma grade (p < 0.001). A large study of 62 thallium-201 SPECT scans showed equally good correlation with glioma grade (p < 0.0005). The use of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of tumour recurrence had 100% sensitivity in this series, while PET scans had 90.9% sensitivity. Patients with a rate of change in serial thallium indexes of 0.475 +/- 0.278 per month survived 5.93 +/- 2.25 months from onset of index increase, while those with little change in the index (0.069 +/- 0.063 per month) survived 17.93 +/- 5.25 months from onset of index increase. Results indicate thallium-201 SPECT correlates well with tumour grade and is equally efficient as PET in screening for glioma recurrence.

Title: MR imaging in cerebral gliomas analysis of tumour tissue components.
Abstract: The aim of this investigation was to assess the capacity of MR imaging to identify the tumour components of cerebral gliomas and thus to grade and delineate these tumours. A comparative analysis between MR examinations and histopathologic whole-brain sections was performed in 5 brain specimens from patients with malignant glial tumours. All cases were examined with MR imaging in vitro. In 2 cases a close comparison with the MR examination in vivo was also possible. The homogeneous hypercellular tumour core was not an isolated entity with typical signal characteristics in any sequence used. However, the tumour core was better observed in T2WI than in T1WI or PDWI, its signal characteristics both in vitro and in vivo being more hypointense than the peritumoural oedema. The use of image subtraction and T2 maps in combination with T2WI increased our capacity to correctly distinguish the most malignant part, compared with using each of these methods separately. In all cases, benign-looking tumour cells were found in the most peripheral aspects of the peritumoural oedema. These cells were not separately identified by any MR sequence or MR imaging method used. In 4 of the 5 cases of malignant glial tumours, we found isolated tumour cells and even larger tumour cell areas, though consisting of benign-looking cells, in areas that were visualized as normal in all sequences and MR imaging methods used. In all cases the necroses were heterogeneous. This heterogeneity was best reflected in the T2WI. Necroses were the most conspicuous tumour components in cases of malignant glioma and best reflected the underlying heterogeneous histopathology. A comparison between contrast-enhanced CT, Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-L-methionine was performed in 14 patients. In all patients except one, the area of increased 11C-L-methionine accumulation on PET, indicating viable tumour tissue, was the same size as, or larger than the extension of the contrast enhancement on both CT and MR. Contrast-enhanced MR and CT gave similar results as regards tumour extension. The increase in signal intensity 5 min post-contrast tended to be greater in the high-grade than in the low-grade tumour group. In order to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of formalin fixation on T1 and T2 of cerebral grey and white matter, MR imaging was also performed in 5 whole-brain specimens from patients with no known brain disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title: Acute changes in glucose uptake after treatment: the effects of carmustine (BCNU) on human glioblastoma multiforme.
Abstract: Sequential positron emission tomographic scans with [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG) were performed on 6 patients with glioblastoma multiforme who were treated with adjuvant BCNU. Scans were acquired before and 24 hours after BCNU. All patients had prior brain irradiation. Ratios between the maximal tumor FDG uptake and the contralateral white matter FDG uptake, the glucose uptake ratio, were determined. Percent changes in the glucose uptake ratio between the baseline scan and the 24 hour post-treatment scan were of prognostic significance. Patients with the largest percent changes in FDG uptake had the shortest survival. In contrast, neither the baseline glucose uptake ratio nor the visual tumor grade accurately predicted length of survival.

Title: Cerebral glioma: evaluation with methionine PET.
Abstract: The authors examined 50 patients with cerebral glioma with use of positron emission tomography (PET) and L-[methyl]-[11C]methionine to assess the grade of malignancy and the extent of cerebral glioma. Carbon-11 methionine was highly accumulated in the lesion in 31 of 32 patients with high-grade glioma and 11 of 18 patients with low-grade glioma. The rate of uptake of C-11 methionine in high-grade glioma was significantly higher than in low-grade glioma (P < .001). However, in individual cases it was difficult to evaluate the grade of malignancy only from the degree of C-11 methionine accumulation. In most cases, the area of increased accumulation of C-11 methionine did not correspond to the abnormalities seen at computed tomography (CT). Surgical intervention confirmed that methionine PET delineated the extent of cerebral glioma more clearly than did CT. The authors concluded that methionine PET has greater utility in assessing the extent rather than the grade of malignancy of cerebral glioma.

Title: [A case of adult pilocytic astrocytoma in the right temporal lobe].
Abstract: A case of adult pilocytic astrocytoma in the right temporal lobe is reported here. The patient was a twenty-four year old man, who came to the neurological division of our hospital on October 6, 1987 because of repeated consciousness-loss attacks accompanied with uncinate fit. He had no neurological deficits. However, an EEG revealed spike-and-wave complexes in the right temporal region, and a CT scan showed a small cystic lesion in the right temporal lobe. A diagnosis of psychomotor seizure was made, and the administration of anticonvulsants was started. The incidence of attack then decreased, but after approximately two years of drug therapy the attacks increased again. A CT scan was again performed, and revealed that the lesion in the right temporal lobe was enlarging. Also a noticeable enhanced lesion, identified as a mural nodule was found in the post-contrast enhancement study. A brain tumor was then suspected, and he was admitted to the neurosurgical division on October 11, 1989. He had no neurological deficits on admission. An MRI showed a low intensity lesion in the T1 weighted image, and a high intensity lesion in the T2 weighted image. A cystic lesion with a marked enhanced mural nodule was also found in the base of the right temporal lobe, according to the Gd enhancement study. Perifocal edema was not recognized. Cerebral angiography showed no positive findings. Positron emission tomography (PET), using H2(15)O, revealed low perfusion at or around the lesion, and PET using [11C]-methionine revealed an accumulation of methionine at the lesion. A diagnosis of low-grade glioma was made, and a right temporal craniotomy, for the purpose of totally removing the tumor was performed on October 26, 1989.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Clinical value of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and L-methyl-11C-methionine for diagnosis of recurrent brain tumor and radiation injury.
Abstract: We studied 15 patients clinically suspected to have recurrent brain tumor or radiation injury, using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) and L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-Met). PET with 11C-Met (Met-PET) clearly delineated the extent of recurrent brain tumor as focal areas of increased accumulation of 11C-Met, and was useful for early detection of recurrent brain tumor. PET with 18FDG (FDG-PET) showed focal 18FDG-hypermetabolism in one patient with malignant transformation of low grade glioma, and demonstrated its usefulness for evaluation of malignant transformation. 18FDG-hypometabolism was observed in all patients with radiation injury, but was also found in one patient with recurrent malignant brain tumor. 11C-Met uptake in 3 patients with radiation injury was similar to that of the normal cortical tissue. FDG-PET can be used to initially exclude recurrent brain tumor which is seen as 18FDG-hypermetabolism. The combined use of Met-PET in addition to FDG-PET can improve the accuracy of differentiation of recurrent brain tumor with 18FDG-hypometabolism from radiation injury.

Title: [The changes of cerebral blood flow and metabolism of normal brain tissue after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in brain tumor patients: evaluated by position emission tomography].
Abstract: The changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism of normal brain tissue after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in brain tumor patients were measured by positron emission tomography (PET). The subjects consisted of 6 men and 3 women, and were from 11 to 62 years old. Those were four patients with glioblastomas, one patient with malignant oligodendroglioma, one patient with astrocytoma grade II, one patient with astrocytoma grade III, one patient with pontine glioma, one patient with pineal germinoma. Seven patients were operated and pathohistologically diagnosed. Two patients with pineal germinoma and pontine glioma were not operated and radiologically diagnosed. Of 7 operated patients, first PET was performed before operation in 3 patients, and from 10 to 16 days after operation in 4 patients. Following first PET, the patients were treated with irradiation (1 case), or with both irradiation and chemotherapy (8 cases). The total radiation dose for tumor was from 59 to 61 Gy distributed in a period of 6-8 weeks. Whole brain irradiation was performed up to 30 or 40 Gy, with a remaining dosimetry (20-30 Gy focused on the tumor field. Chemotherapy consisted of intravenous administration of ACNU and oral administration of FT-207. Second PET was performed 1 month after therapy (9 cases), and third PET was performed from 4 to 24 months after therapy (6 cases). Fourth PET was performed in 2 patients (22 and 35 months after therapy), and fifth PET was performed in one patient (35 months after therapy).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: [Value of 11C-methionine and PET in the diagnosis of low grade gliomas].
Abstract: Ten patients with low grade glioma were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-methyl-L-methionine (11C-Met). In 4 cases, follow-up study was performed after radiation therapy. 11C-Met uptake index was calculated by sequential arterial blood sampling and PET image on 45 minutes after injection. The tumor was clearly seen in the images, and uptake index in the tumor lesion was higher than that in the normal cortex. The uptake of 11C-Met was observed in a recurrent lesion that was confirmed by operation. 11C-Met uptake indices were decreased in the tumor lesions after radiation therapy. From these results PET with 11C-Met is a useful clinical tool for diagnosis of low grade gliomas.

Title: The accumulation of 11C-methionine in cerebral glioma patients studied with PET.
Abstract: Fourteen patients with cerebral gliomas were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) using L-[methyl-11C]methionine (11C-MET). Positive images of tumour were obtained in all cases regardless of histological grades. The analysis of differential absorption ratio (DAR) showed the higher accumulation of 11C-MET in high grade gliomas than in low grade gliomas. PET study with 11C-MET will be of great value not only in delineating the location of gliomas, but also in making a qualitative diagnosis from the view point of the biological properties of gliomas.

Title: Evaluation of glucose transport in malignant glioma by PET.
Abstract: Using dynamic PET mode and 18FDG, glucose transport in patients with gliomas were investigated. The values for transfer rate constants k1*, k2*, k3*, and glucose consumption were found to be low in the low-grade glioma as compared to those of the high-grade glioma and the contralateral cerebral cortex. The differences were statistically significant with the exception of k2*. There were no statistically significant differences between the high-grade glioma and the contralateral cerebral cortex. In contrast, the distribution volumes k1*/k2* and k1*/(k2* + k3*) were low in high-grade glioma and the difference between the high-grade glioma and the contralateral cerebral cortex was statistically significant. A difference in k1*/(k2* + k3*) was noted between the low-grade and the high-grade gliomas. Thus, the distribution volumes are most sensitive for differentiation between high-grade glioma and cerebral cortex.

Title: [Metabolic studies of gliomas with positron emission tomography and phosphorus 31 MR spectroscopy in diagnosis and treatment planning].
Abstract: Glioma are often histologically heterogenous. As many of these tumors are not removable in toto, due to their localisation, the most malignant part of the tumor may be missed and information for optimum therapeutic management is incomplete. Furthermore, low grade gliomas tend to become more malignant in their development; additional surgical intervention is often not possible. Non-invasive measurement of tumor glucose metabolism with (F-18)-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and positron-emission-tomography (PET) may be used to evaluate tumor malignancy. Malignant gliomas (astrocytoma III degree and glioblastoma) frequently showed increased peak metabolic rates (in comparison with normal white matter) and uncoupling of FDG transport and phosphorylation. Preliminary experiences with image-guided localized phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy (P-31 MRS) demonstrated a decrease of phosphodiesters in malignant gliomas, whereas the phosphomonoesters showed an increase in several cases. The phosphocreatine peak was often reduced. A more active therapy of low grade gliomas might be indicated when signs of hypermetabolism in FDG-PET and alteration of energy-rich phosphates or membrane-phosphates in P-31 MRS are found.

Title: Positron emission tomography and computed tomography in differential diagnosis between recurrent or residual glioma and treatment-induced brain lesions.
Abstract: In previous studies of supratentorial gliomas with positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), high uptakes of L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-L-methionine) were found even in astrocytomas without blood-brain barrier defects as judged by CT or 68Ga-EDTA PET. In a number of patients examined after radiation therapy, there were no consistent changes in the high uptake values. In the present investigation PET and CT were compared with regard to their abilities to visualize and delineate recurrent tumors and treatment-induced brain defects and to differentiate between them. The study was undertaken on four patients who were long-term survivors after treatment for high-grade gliomas. For PET, 11C-L-methionine and 68Ga-EDTA were used. In two patients recurrent/residual tumors appeared considerably larger with 11C-L-methionine PET than with CT or 68Ga-EDTA PET. In one patient, no signs of recurrence were seen with any of these three methods, and in a fourth patient, whose condition was clinically stable, the findings at PET with 11C-L-methionine were non-specific. In areas corresponding to the surgical parenchymal defects, the 11C-L-methionine uptake and, except in one case, the local blood volume was markedly reduced. PET with 11C-L-methionine thus has a potential for distinguishing between postoperative brain lesions and tumor recurrence with a higher accuracy than CT.

Title: Positron emission tomography in the detection of malignant degeneration of low-grade gliomas.
Abstract: The management of low-grade gliomas represents a challenge to the physician as a significant proportion may undergo malignant degeneration to a high-grade tumor. We present the positron emission tomography (PET) scans, using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), of 12 patients who have histological and/or clinical evidence of malignant degeneration of a low-grade glioma. Each scan displays a focal area of hypermetabolism similar to that of malignant gliomas which arise de novo. Three patients also underwent PET scanning prior to malignant degeneration. When the initial scan is compared with the postmalignant degeneration study, a difference in tumoral glucose uptake can be recognized. A region previously shown to be hypometabolic develops focal hypermetabolism as malignant changes evolve. This study displays the utility of FDG-PET in the evaluation of malignant degeneration of low-grade gliomas. The knowledge that a neoplasm has altered its biological behavior may influence subsequent therapeutic options. If these findings can be confirmed in larger series and by other investigators, it is possible that FDG-PET may be adopted as one of the diagnostic tools for guiding the management of low-grade gliomas.

Title: Positron emission tomography in patients with glioma. A predictor of prognosis.
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been performed using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose in 29 adult subjects with primary brain tumors. Seventy-two percent of the patients were treated previously. The glucose metabolic state in the lesions was increased in 16 patients, and was normal or decreased in 13 patients. The hypermetabolic tumors tended to behave in a more malignant fashion. Patients with hypermetabolic tumors had a median survival of 7 months after PET scan, compared to 33 months for those with hypometabolic lesions. Among the high-grade glioma patients, the PET results separated them into a good prognosis group (hypometabolic, with 78% 1-year survival) and a poor prognosis group (hypermetabolic, with a 29% 1-year survival after PET). These results suggest that glucose metabolic studies may provide an independent measure of the aggressiveness of a brain tumor, and may supplement pathologic grading.

Title: Tomographic studies of rCBF with 99mTc-HM-PAO SPECT in comparison with PET in patients with primary brain tumors.
Abstract: 99mTc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxime (HM-PAO) was developed as a radiotracer of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with SPECT. THe purpose of this study was to investigate if HM-PAO is able to trace rCBF in primary brain tumors. In 10 patients with glioblastoma grade IV the intracerebral distribution of HM-PAO was studied in comparison with C15O2 steady state inhalation technique and PET for rCBF evaluation. In all instances the cerebral HM-PAO distribution was comparable with rCBF pattern as confirmed by a significant correlation of tumor to cortex ratios. The results indicate the clinical usefulness of HM-PAO for tracing rCBF in brain tumors.

Title: Non selective transport of [11C-methyl]-L-and D-methionine into a malignant glioma.
Abstract: Images obtained by X-ray CT, brain scintigraphy (99mTc-DTPA) and positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C-methyl]-L- and D-methionine in a case of malignant glioma are presented, showing good agreement of PET and CT findings, in particular nearly identical localization of L- and D-methionine accumulation, whereas the blood brain barrier is only slightly disturbed. In a greater number of patients the amount of accumulated stereoisomers do not differ on a significant level, indicating that a raised transport rate mediated by a carrier of low stereospecifity seems to contribute substantially to the increased uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine in human brain tumors. Several cerebral functions and diseases have been studied with positron emission tomography (PET), which represents a clinical tool for visualizing metabolic activities rather than morphologic lesions (Reivich et al. 1985; Mazziotta et al. 1986). With regard to the malignancy of brain tumors DiChiro et al. (1982, 1984, 1985a, b) showed a correlation between tumor grade and its glucose metabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. An increased uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine into tumor tissue has also been described (Hubner et al. 1980; Bergstrom et al. 1983; Kubota et al. 1984; Meyer et al. 1985; Schober et al. 1986b). Bustany et al. (1981, 1983, 1985a, b, 1986) developed a model for quantitative determination of protein synthesis, postulating that methionine incorporation into protein in brain tumors correlates with grade of malignancy. We do not believe that the uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine mainly reflects protein synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title: Positron emission tomography of cavernous haemangiomas of the brain.
Abstract: Four cases with lesions suspected to be low-grade intracerebral tumours but later proved to be cavernous haemangiomas are described. The patients were examined with contrast enhanced CT and with positron emission tomography (PET). The lesions were partly calcified with a mild or no mass effect and a slight contrast enhancement at CT. There were signs of disrupture of the blood-lesion barrier also on radionuclide studies. PET with 11C-methionine and 11C-glucose showed a normal or decreased accumulation of the tracers. This combination of findings has not been encountered in intracranial tumours. As a comparison, one case of glioblastoma is described. In this patient, the CT findings suggested a cavernous haemangioma. However, PET showed a markedly increased accumulation of 11C-methionine, which is compatible with brain tumour but not with haemangioma.

Title: Relation between tissue nature and (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose kinetics evaluated by dynamic positron emission tomography in human brain tumors.
Abstract: Using dynamic positron emission tomographic (PET) scans, kinetic rate constants in the (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) model and glucose consumption rate were measured in human brain tumors. In the tumor tissue, all rate constants were higher on the average in the glioma grade IV and the non-glial tumor groups. The k*3 showed wide deviation in the glioma grade IV group. Discrepancy was found between the k*3 and the glucose consumption rate in several cases. The k*1 correlated with the neovascularity in tumors confirmed at angiography. Analysis of the rate constants might be useful for interpreting tumor nature and predicting its malignancy.

Title: Peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in human gliomas evaluated with positron emission tomography.
Abstract: A specific ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, Ro5-4864, was synthesised and labelled with 11C for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Four patients with suspected glioma, two patients with high grade astrocytoma and two with low grade astrocytoma, as well as one patient with meningioma were examined with PET after the administration of 200 MBq 11C-Ro5-4864. The images as well as kinetic analyses revealed lower uptake of the ligand in tumor as compared with cortical tissue. Markedly elevated uptake in the thalamus suggests a functional role of the ligand.

Title: Prediction of survival in glioma patients by means of positron emission tomography.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 (18F)-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) can be used as a prognostic test in patients with high-grade cerebral gliomas, regardless of the treatment given. Forty-five patients with astrocytoma Grade III or IV were included in this analysis. The mean survival time of patients with tumors exhibiting high glucose utilization as determined by PET-FDG was 5 months, whereas patients with gliomas showing lower glucose utilization had a mean survival period of 19 months. It is postulated that PET-FDG scans reflect the biological behavior of high-grade astrocytomas and may be used to predict the survival time of patients harboring such neoplasms.

Title: Issues in the in vivo measurement of glucose metabolism of human central nervous system tumors.
Abstract: Over 150 cases of central nervous system tumors have been studied with positron emission tomography using fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) as a tracer. From this material 100 consecutive cases of cerebral glioma have been reviewed and analyzed. The results show a strong correlation of tumor grade with glycolytic rate, with visual "hot spots" present in all high-grade neoplasms and in only four low-grade tumors. The quantitative accuracy is limited by three basic factors. First, the measurement of tissue uptake, as compared with the parent technique, autoradiography, is more difficult because detection must be done outside the body. Effects such as scattered radiation and self-attenuation introduce errors unless properly corrected. A more serious problem when measuring small structures, such as a rim-shaped high-grade glioma, is the limited spatial resolution. The most advanced scanner, the Neuro-PET, has a resolution of 6 to 7 mm. Second, corrections are needed for backflow, including free tracer at the time of the scan that will return to the blood and "trapped" tracer that will backflow because of the presence of phosphatase. These corrections are calculated from the blood activity using nominal rate constants for 18FDG. Our study found no significant alteration in rate constants between normal and tumoral tissue. Finally, a lumped constant is needed to correct for kinetic differences between 18FDG and glucose. If there is a change in the mechanism of either membrane transport or the hexokinase reaction, the lumped constant may change. However, measurements of actual glucose utilization in tissue culture lines from six patients support the 18FDG results.

Title: Glycolytic rate (PET) and contrast enhancement (CT) in human cerebral gliomas.
Abstract: A comparison of the glycolytic rate as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) and cerebral contrast computed tomography (CT) was carried out in 72 cases of cerebral glioma. FDG-PET is more accurate than contrast CT in predicting tumor grade.
