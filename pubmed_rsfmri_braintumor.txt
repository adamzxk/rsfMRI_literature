Title: Data-efficient resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging brain mapping with deep learning.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) enables the mapping of function within the brain and is emerging as an efficient tool for the presurgical evaluation of eloquent cortex. Models capable of reliable and precise mapping of resting-state networks (RSNs) with a reduced scanning time would lead to improved patient comfort while reducing the cost per scan. The aims of the present study were to develop a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) capable of voxel-wise mapping of language (LAN) and motor (MOT) RSNs with minimal quantities of RS-fMRI data. METHODS: Imaging data were gathered from multiple ongoing studies at Washington University School of Medicine and other thoroughly characterized, publicly available data sets. All study participants (n = 2252 healthy adults) were cognitively screened and completed structural neuroimaging and RS-fMRI. Random permutations of RS-fMRI regions of interest were used to train a 3DCNN. After training, model inferences were compared using varying amounts of RS-fMRI data from the control data set as well as 5 patients with glioblastoma multiforme. RESULTS: The trained model achieved 96% out-of-sample validation accuracy on data encompassing a large age range collected on multiple scanner types and varying sequence parameters. Testing on out-of-sample control data showed 97.9% similarity between results generated using either 50 or 200 RS-fMRI time points, corresponding to approximately 2.5 and 10 minutes, respectively (96.9% LAN, 96.3% MOT true-positive rate). In evaluating data from patients with brain tumors, the 3DCNN was able to accurately map LAN and MOT networks despite structural and functional alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Functional maps produced by the 3DCNN can inform surgical planning in patients with brain tumors in a time-efficient manner. The authors present a highly efficient method for presurgical functional mapping and thus improved functional preservation in patients with brain tumors.

Title: Power spectral analysis can determine language laterality from resting-state functional MRI data in healthy controls.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has been proposed as an alternative to task-based fMRI including clinical situations such as preoperative brain tumor planning, due to advantages including ease of performance and time savings. However, one of its drawbacks is the limited ability to accurately lateralize language function. METHODS: Using the rsfMRI data of healthy controls, we carried out a power spectra analysis on three regions of interest (ROIs): Broca's area (BA) in the frontal cortex for language, hand motor (HM) area in the primary motor cortex, and the primary visual cortex (V1). Spike removal, motion correction, linear trend removal, and spatial smoothing were applied. Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (0.01-0.1 Hz) were filtered to enable functional integration. RESULTS: BA showed greater power on the left hemisphere relative to the right (p = .0055), while HM (p = .1563) and V1 (p = .4681) were not statistically significant. A novel index, termed the power laterality index (PLI), computed to estimate the degree of power lateralization for each brain region, revealed a statistically significant difference between BA and V1 (p < .00001), where V1 was used as a control since the primary visual cortex does not lateralize. Validation studies used to compare PLI to a laterality index computed using phonemic fluency, a task-based, language fMRI paradigm, demonstrated good correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The power spectra for BA revealed left language lateralization, which was not replicated in HM or V1. This work demonstrates the feasibility and validity of an ROI-based power spectra analysis on rsfMRI data for language lateralization.

Title: Early recovery of cognition and brain plasticity after surgery in children with low-grade frontal lobe tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low-grade frontal lobe tumors (LGFLT) can be cured through total resection, but surgical trauma could impair higher-order cognitive function. We aim to characterize the short-term natural cognitive recovery and brain plasticity in surgically-treated pediatric patients with LGFLT. METHODS: Ten pediatric patients with LGFLT were enrolled. Their cognitive function was assessed before the surgery (S0), in the first month post-surgery (S1), and 3-6 months post-surgery (S2), using the CNS Vital Signs battery. DTI and rs-fMRI were performed during the same time periods. Changes of cognition and image metrics between S1>S0 and S2>S1 were analyzed. RESULTS: The Motor Speed (MotSp) and Reaction Time (RT) scores significantly decreased in S1 and recovered in S2. Rs-fMRI showed decreased functional connectivity (FC) between the bilateral frontal lobes and bilateral caudates, putamina, and pallidi in S1>S0 (voxel threshold p-unc < 0.001 , cluster threshold p-FDR < 0.05 ). In S2>S1, FC recovery was observed in the neighboring frontal cortex areas ( p-unc < 0.001 , p-FDR < 0.05 ). Among them, the FC in the caudates-right inferior frontal gyri was positively correlated to the RT ( p-FDR < 0.05 ). A DTI Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity mainly in the corticospinal tracts, cingulum, internal capsule, and external capsule at 0-6 months post-surgery (TFCE- p < 0.05 ). The DTI metrics were not associated with the cognitive data. CONCLUSION: Processing speed impairment after an LGFLT resection can recover naturally within 3-6 months in school-age children. Rs-fMRI is more sensitive to short-term brain plasticity than DTI TBSS analysis. "Map expansion" plasticity in the frontal-basal ganglia circuit may contribute to the recovery.

Title: The impact of brain lesions on health-related quality of life in patients with WHO CNS grade 3 or 4 glioma: a lesion-function and resting-state fMRI analysis.
Abstract: PURPOSE: In glioma patients, tumor development and multimodality therapy are associated with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is largely unknown how different types and locations of tumor- and treatment-related brain lesions, as well as their relationship to white matter tracts and functional brain networks, affect HRQoL. METHODS: In 121 patients with pretreated gliomas of WHO CNS grades 3 or 4, structural MRI, O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and self-reported HRQoL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20) were obtained. Resection cavities, T1-enhancing lesions, T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, and lesions with pathologically increased FET uptake were delineated. Effects of tumor lateralization, involvement of white matter tracts or resting-state network nodes by different types of lesions and within-network rs-fMRI connectivity were analyzed in terms of their interaction with HRQoL scores. RESULTS: Right hemisphere gliomas were associated with significantly less favorable outcomes in physical, role, emotional and social functioning, compared with left-sided tumors. Most functional HRQoL scores correlated significantly with right-sided white-matter tracts involvement by T2/FLAIR hyperintensities and with loss of within-network functional connectivity of right-sided nodes. Tumors of the left hemisphere caused significantly more communication deficits. CONCLUSION: In pretreated high-grade gliomas, right hemisphere lesions are associated with reduced HRQoL scores in most functional domains except communication ability, compared to tumors of the left hemisphere. These relationships are mainly observed for T2/FLAIR lesions involving structural and functional networks in the right hemisphere. The data suggest that sparing the right hemisphere from treatment-related tissue damage may improve HRQoL in glioma patients.

Title: [Construction and analysis of functional network of hemi-brain in patients with brain tumors before and after anesthesia based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging].
Abstract: Objective: To construct and analyze the functional network changes of hemi-brain in patients with brain tumor before and after anesthesia by using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methods: A total of 18 right-handed patients were prospectively included (6 males and 12 females). The patients underwent glioma resection in Peking University International Hospital from December 2018 to December 2021, and age ranged from 20 to 65 (45.1+/-13.6) years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of Ⅰ-Ⅱ. MRI scans were performed while the patient was awake and at the depth of surgical anesthesia. The functional network of healthy lateral brain was constructed and analyzed by means of graph theory, and its global and local topological properties were calculated. Global topology attributes included global efficiency (Eg), local efficiency (Eloc), clustering parameters (Cp), length parameter of shortest path (Lp), and small world (SW). Topology attributes of nodes included node degree (ND), node efficiency (NE) and between centrality (BC). The global and nodal topological properties of the hemi-brain network were compared between patients with different hemispherical space occupying under wakefulness and anesthesia. Results: At the awake state, Eloc and Cp in the global topological attributes of hemi-brain network were 0.259+/-0.007 and 0.197+/-0.010, respectively, and decreased to 0.242+/-0.013 and 0.177+/-0.021, respectively after anesthesia, with statistically significant differences (all P<0.01). The topological attributes of the nodes in hemi-side brain showed that ND, NE and BC were increased in the default mode network-related brain regions, while NE and BC were decreased in the limbic system and subcortical structures. Eloc and Cp were 0.258+/-0.008 and 0.198+/-0.008 respectively in the patients with left hemisphere space occupying, and decreased to 0.241+/-0.011 and 0.177+/-0.015 respectively after anesthesia, with statistically significant differences (all P<0.01). However, only Eloc decreased in patients with right hemisphere space occupying after anesthesia, and Eloc was 0.260+/-0.006 and 0.243+/-0.016 respectively when awake and after anesthesia, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). The topological attributes of nodes in patients with space occupying in different cerebral hemispheres showed bidirectional changes after anesthesia, and patients with space occupying in the left cerebral hemisphere were more likely to be widely affected after anesthesia. The effects of anesthetic drugs may show hemispheric laterality. If the tumor was in the dominant hemisphere, the compensatory function of the dominant side was more likely to be damaged. Conclusions: During anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness in patients with brain tumors, both the ability to integrate information and the functional connections between local regions are weakened, and some brain regions have functional connection reorganization. The changes of brain network after anesthesia are bidirectional regulation.

Title: Implementation of Automated Pipeline for Resting-State fMRI Analysis with PACS Integration.
Abstract: In recent years, the quantity and complexity of medical imaging acquisition and processing have increased tremendously. The explosion in volume and need for advanced imaging analysis have led to the creation of numerous software programs, which have begun to be incorporated into clinical practice for indications such as automated stroke assessment, brain tumor perfusion processing, and hippocampal volume analysis. Despite these advances, there remains a need for specialized, custom-built software for advanced algorithms and new areas of research that is not widely available or adequately integrated in these "out-of-the-box" solutions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of an image-processing pipeline that is versatile and simple to create, which allows for rapid prototyping of image analysis algorithms and subsequent testing in a clinical environment. This pipeline uses a combination of Orthanc server, custom MATLAB code, and publicly available FMRIB Software Library and RestNeuMap tools to automatically receive and analyze resting-state functional MRI data collected from a custom filter on the MR scanner output. The processed files are then sent directly to Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) without the need for user input. This initial experience can serve as a framework for those interested in simple implementation of an automated pipeline customized to clinical needs.

Title: Tumor BOLD connectivity profile correlates with glioma patients' survival.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Presence of residual neurovascular activity within glioma lesions have been recently demonstrated via functional MRI (fMRI) along with active electrical synapses between glioma cells and healthy neurons that influence survival. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether gliomas demonstrate synchronized neurovascular activity with the rest of the brain, by measuring Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal synchronization, that is, functional connectivity (FC), while also testing whether the strength of such connectivity might predict patients' overall survival (OS). METHODS: Resting-state fMRI scans of patients who underwent pre-surgical brain mapping were analyzed (total sample, n = 54; newly diagnosed patients, n = 18; recurrent glioma group, n = 36). A seed-to-voxel analysis was conducted to estimate the FC signal profile of the tumor mass. A regression model was then built to investigate the potential correlation between tumor FC and individual OS. Finally, an unsupervised, cross-validated clustering analysis was performed including tumor FC and clinical OS predictors (e.g., Karnofsky Performance Status - KPS - score, tumor volume, and genetic profile) to verify the performance of tumor FC in predicting OS with respect to validated radiological, demographic, genetic and clinical prognostic factors. RESULTS: In both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma patients a significant pattern of BOLD synchronization between the solid tumor and distant brain regions was found. Crucially, glioma-brain FC positively correlated with variance in individual survival in both newly diagnosed glioma group (r = 0.90-0.96; P < .001; R (2) = 81-92%) and in the recurrent glioma group (r = 0.72; P < .001; R (2) = 52%), outperforming standard clinical, radiological and genetic predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest glioma's synchronization with distant brain regions should be further explored as a possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.

Title: Self-Referential Processing and Resting-State Functional MRI Connectivity of Cortical Midline Structures in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Metacognition has only scarcely been investigated in brain tumor patients. It is unclear if and how the tumor-lesioned brain might be able to maintain an adequate sense-of-self. As cortical midline structures (CMS) are regarded as essential for self-referential mental activity, we investigated resting-state fMRI connectivity (FC) of CMS to the default-mode network (DMN) and to the whole brain, comparing glioma patients and matched controls. Subjects furthermore performed a trait judgement (TJ), a trait recall task (TR), and neuropsychological testing. In the TJ, adjectives had to be ascribed as self- or non-self-describing, assessing the self-serving effect (SSE), a normally observed bias for positive traits. In the TR, the mnemic neglect effect (MNE), a memory advantage for positive traits, was tested. The groups were compared and partial correlations between FC and test metrics were analyzed. Although patients were significantly impaired in terms of verbal memory, groups did not differ in the SSE or the MNE results, showing preserved metacognitive abilities in patients. FC of CMS to the DMN was maintained, but was significantly decreased to whole brain in the patients. FC of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) to whole brain was correlated with the MNE in patients. Preserving the DMPFC in therapeutic interventions might be relevant for maintaining self-related verbal information processing in the memory domain in glioma patients.

Title: Alteration of default mode network: association with executive dysfunction in frontal glioma patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with frontal gliomas often experience executive dysfunction (EF-D) before surgery, and the changes in brain plasticity underlying this effect remain obscure. In this study, the authors aimed to assess whole-brain structural and functional alterations by using structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in frontal glioma patients with or without EF-D. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with frontal gliomas were admitted prospectively to the authors' institution and assigned to one of two groups: 1) the normal executive function (EF-N) group and 2) the EF-D group, based on patient results for the Trail Making Test, Part B and Stroop Color-Word Test, Part C. Twenty-nine baseline-matched healthy controls were also recruited. All participants underwent multimodal MRI examination. Cortical surface thickness, surface-based resting-state activity (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation [fALFF] and regional homogeneity [ReHo]), and edge-based network functional connectivity (FC) were measured with FreeSurfer and fMRIPrep. The correlation between altered MRI parameters and executive function (EF) was assessed using Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics (sex, age, and education level) and clinical characteristics (location, volume, grade of tumor, and preoperative epilepsy) were not significantly different between the groups, but the Karnofsky Performance Scale score was worse in the EF-D group. There was no significant difference in cortical surface thickness between the EF-D and EF-N groups. In both low-grade and high-grade glioma patients the fALFF value (permutation test + threshold-free cluster enhancement, p value after family-wise error correction < 0.05) and ReHo value (t-test, p < 0.001) of the left precuneus cortex in the EF-D group were greater than those in the EF-N group, which were negatively correlated with EF (p < 0.05) and enabled prediction of EF (area under the ROC curve 0.826 for fALFF and 0.855 for ReHo, p < 0.001). Compared with the EF-N group, the FCs between the default mode network (DMN) from DMN node to DMN node (DMN-DMN) and from the DMN to the central executive network (DMN-CEN) in the EF-D group were increased significantly (network-based statistics corrected p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with EF (Pearson correlation, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Apart from local disruption, the abnormally activated DMN in the resting state is related to EF-D in frontal glioma patients. DMN activity should be considered during preoperative planning and postoperative neurorehabilitation for frontal glioma patients to preserve EF.

Title: Synergetic reorganization of the contralateral structure and function in patients with unilateral frontal glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the contralateral structural and functional plasticity induced by frontal gliomas. METHODS: Patients with left (n = 49) or right (n = 52) frontal diffuse glioma were enrolled along with 35 age- matched healthy controls (HCs). The gray-matter volumes (GMVs) of the contralesional region were measured using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Additionally, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the contralesional region was calculated via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess functional alterations. RESULT: The GMV of the contralateral orbitofrontal cortex of the right or left frontal gliomas was significantly larger than the corresponding GMV in the controls. In the patients with right frontal glioma, the GMV and ALFF in the left inferior frontal gyrus were significantly increased compared with those in the controls. CONCLUSION: Glioma invasion of the frontal lobe can induce contralateral structural compensation and functional compensation, which show synergy in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Our findings explain why patients with unilateral frontal glioma can have functional balance, and offer the possibility of preserving the brain function while maximizing tumor removal.

Title: [Comparison of resting state and task-based functional MRI in preoperative mapping in patients with brain gliomas].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare the results of cerebral cortex mapping with task-based (tb-fMRI) and resting-state functional MRI in patients with glioma of eloquent cortical areas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 55 patients (24 men and 31 women aged 24 - 74 years, median 39) with glial tumors. In 26 patients, the tumor was located in motor areas. Twenty-nine patients had lesions of Broca and Wernicke's areas. All patients underwent preoperative tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI. Then, resection of tumor was carried out in all cases. RESULTS: Comparison of fMRI and rs-fMRI activation maps was assessed by calculating the Dice coefficient for inclusive speech and motor cortex masks and exclusive masks without brainstem, cerebellum, subcortical nuclei. Inclusive Dice coefficient for motor cortex ranged from 0.11 to 0.50, for speech cortex - from 0.006 to 0.240 (p<0.05). In case of exclusive masks, this value ranged from 0.15 to 0.55 for motor cortex and from 0.004 to 0.205 for speech cortex (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: When comparing the results of cortical mapping in patients with glial tumors, the use of hemispheric exclusive and inclusive masks did not significantly increase activation maps matching. Probably, low degree of correspondence was associated with different genesis of activations, as well as with high variability of speech cortex.

Title: Comparison between inferior frontal gyrus intrinsic connectivity network and verb-generation task fMRI network for presurgical language mapping in healthy controls and in glioma patients.
Abstract: Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) represents an extremely valuable approach for the identification of language eloquent regions for presurgical mapping in patients with brain tumors. However, its routinely application is limited by patient-related factors, such as cognitive disability and difficulty in coping with long-time acquisitions, and by technical factors, such as lack of equipment availability for stimuli delivery. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) instead, allows the identification of distinct language networks in a 10-min acquisition without the need of performing active tasks and using specific equipment. Therefore, to test the feasibility of rs-fMRI as a preoperative mapping tool, we reconstructed a lexico-semantic intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) in healthy controls (HC) and in a case series of patients with gliomas and compared the organization of this language network with the one derived from tb-fMRI in the patient's group. We studied three patients with extra-frontal gliomas who underwent functional mapping with auditory verb-generation (AVG) task and rs-fMRI with a seed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). First, we identified the functional connected areas to the IFG in HC. We qualitatively compared these areas with those that showed functional activation in AVG task derived from Neurosynth meta-analysis. Last, in each patient we performed single-subject analyses both for rs- and tb-fMRI, and we evaluated the spatial overlap between the two approaches. In HC, the IFG-ICN network showed a predominant left fronto-temporal functional connectivity in regions overlapping with the AVG network derived from a meta-analysis. In two patients, rs- and tb-fMRI showed comparable patterns of activation in left fronto-temporal regions, with different levels of contralateral activations. The third patient could not accomplish the AVG task and thus it was not possible to make any comparison with the ICN. However, in this patient, task-free approach disclosed a consistent network of fronto-temporal regions as in HC, and additional parietal regions. Our preliminary findings support the value of rs-fMRI approach for presurgical mapping, particularly for identifying left fronto-temporal core language-related areas in glioma patients. In a preoperative setting, rs-fMRI approach could represent a powerful tool for the identification of eloquent language areas, especially in patients with language or cognitive impairments.

Title: Brain Functional Connectivity in Low- and High-Grade Gliomas: Differences in Network Dynamics Associated with Tumor Grade and Location.
Abstract: Brain tumors lead to modifications of brain networks. Graph theory plays an important role in clarifying the principles of brain connectivity. Our objective was to investigate network modifications related to tumor grade and location using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory. We retrospectively studied 30 low-grade (LGG), 30 high-grade (HGG) left-hemispheric glioma patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) with rs-fMRI. Tumor location was labeled as: frontal, temporal, parietal, insular or occipital. We collected patients' clinical data from records. We analyzed whole-brain and hemispheric networks in all patients and HC. Subsequently, we studied lobar networks in subgroups of patients divided by tumor location. Seven graph-theoretical metrics were calculated (FDR p < 0.05). Connectograms were computed for significant nodes. The two-tailed Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test (p < 0.05) were used to compare graph metrics and clinical data. The hemispheric network analysis showed increased ipsilateral connectivity for LGG (global efficiency p = 0.03) and decreased contralateral connectivity for HGG (degree/cost p = 0.028). Frontal and temporal tumors showed bilateral modifications; parietal and insular tumors showed only local effects. Temporal tumors led to a bilateral decrease in all graph metrics. Tumor grade and location influence the pattern of network reorganization. LGG may show more favorable network changes than HGG, reflecting fewer clinical deficits.

Title: RP-Rs-fMRIomics as a Novel Imaging Analysis Strategy to Empower Diagnosis of Brain Gliomas.
Abstract: Rs-fMRI can provide rich information about functional processes in the brain with a large array of imaging parameters and is also suitable for investigating the biological processes in cerebral gliomas. We aimed to propose an imaging analysis method of RP-Rs-fMRIomics by adopting omics analysis on rs-fMRI with exhaustive regional parameters and subsequently estimating its feasibility on the prediction diagnosis of gliomas. In this retrospective study, preoperative rs-fMRI data were acquired from patients confirmed with diffuse gliomas (n = 176). A total of 420 features were extracted through measuring 14 regional parameters of rs-fMRI as much as available currently in 10 specific narrow frequency bins and three parts of gliomas. With a randomly split training and testing dataset (ratio 7:3), four classifiers were implemented to construct and optimize RP-Rs-fMRIomics models for predicting glioma grade, IDH status and Karnofsky Performance Status scores. The RP-Rs-fMRIomics models (AUROC 0.988, 0.905, 0.801) were superior to the corresponding traditional single rs-fMRI index (AUROC 0.803, 0.731, 0.632) in predicting glioma grade, IDH and survival. The RP-Rs-fMRIomics analysis, featuring high interpretability, was competitive for prediction of glioma grading, IDH genotype and prognosis. The method expanded the clinical application of rs-fMRI and also contributed a new imaging analysis for brain tumor research.

Title: A Multi-Scale Spatial and Temporal Attention Network on Dynamic Connectivity to Localize The Eloquent Cortex in Brain Tumor Patients.
Abstract: We present a deep neural network architecture that combines multi-scale spatial attention with temporal attention to simultaneously localize the language and motor areas of the eloquent cortex from dynamic functional connectivity data. Our multi-scale spatial attention operates on graph-based features extracted from the connectivity matrices, thus honing in on the inter-regional interactions that collectively define the eloquent cortex. At the same time, our temporal attention model selects the intervals during which these interactions are most pronounced. The final stage of our model employs multi-task learning to differentiate between the eloquent subsystems. Our training strategy enables us to handle missing eloquent class labels by freezing the weights in those branches while updating the rest of the network weights. We evaluate our method on resting-state fMRI data from one synthetic dataset and one in-house brain tumor dataset while using task fMRI activations as ground-truth labels for the eloquent cortex. Our model achieves higher localization accuracies than conventional deep learning approaches. It also produces interpretable spatial and temporal attention features which can provide further insights for presurgical planning. Thus, our model shows translational promise for improving the safety of brain tumor resections.

Title: The role of the default mode network in longitudinal functional brain reorganization of brain gliomas.
Abstract: The study of patients after glioma resection offers a unique opportunity to investigate brain reorganization. It is currently unknown how the whole-brain connectomic profile evolves longitudinally after surgical resection of a glioma and how this may be associated with tumor characteristics and cognitive outcome. In this longitudinal study, we investigate the impact of tumor lateralization and grade on functional connectivity (FC) in highly connected networks, or hubs, and cognitive performance. Twenty-eight patients (17 high-grade, 11 low-grade gliomas) underwent longitudinal pre/post-surgery resting-state fMRI scans and neuropsychological assessments (73 total measures). FC matrices were constructed considering as functional hubs the default mode (DMN) and fronto-parietal networks. No-hubs included primary sensory functional networks and any other no-hubs nodes. Both tumor hemisphere and grade affected brain reorganization post-resection. In right-hemisphere tumor patients, regardless of grade and relative to left-hemisphere gliomas, FC increased longitudinally after the intervention, both in terms of FC within hubs (p(hubs) = 0.0004) and FC between hubs and no-hubs (p(hubs-no-hubs) = 0.005). Regardless of tumor side, only lower-grade gliomas showed longitudinal FC increases relative to high-grade tumors within a precise hub network, the DMN. The neurocognitive profile was longitudinally associated with spatial features of the connectome, mainly within the DMN. We provide evidence that clinical glioma features, such as lateralization and grade, affect post-surgical longitudinal functional reorganization and cognitive recovery. The data suggest a possible role of the DMN in supporting cognition, providing useful information for prognostic prediction and surgical planning.

Title: Longitudinal assessment of network reorganizations and language recovery in postoperative patients with glioma.
Abstract: For patients with glioma located in or adjacent to the linguistic eloquent cortex, awake surgery with an emphasis on the preservation of language function is preferred. However, the brain network basis of postoperative linguistic functional outcomes remains largely unknown. In this work, 34 patients with left cerebral gliomas who underwent awake surgery were assessed for language function and resting-state network properties before and after surgery. We found that there were 28 patients whose language function returned to at least 80% of the baseline scores within 3 months after surgery or to 85% within 6 months after surgery. For these patients, the spontaneous recovery of language function synchronized with changes within the language and cognitive control networks, but not with other networks. Specifically, compared with baseline values, language functions and global network properties were the worst within 1 month after surgery and gradually recovered within 6 months after surgery. The recovery of connections was tumour location dependent and was attributed to both ipsihemispheric and interhemispheric connections. In contrast, for six patients whose language function did not recover well, severe network disruptions were observed before surgery and persisted into the chronic phase. This study suggests the synchronization of functional network normalization and spontaneous language recovery in postoperative patients with glioma.

Title: Functional reorganization of contralesional networks varies according to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status in patients with left frontal lobe glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The study aimed to assess how isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status in patients with glioma may alter functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network (FPN). METHODS: Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, a seed-based FC analysis was employed to investigate connectivity within and between networks in seventeen patients with IDH1-mutant glioma (IDH1-M), eleven patients with IDH1-wildtype glioma (IDH1-WT), and nineteen healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: For FC within the DMN, compared to HC, both IDH1-M and IDH1-WT exhibited significantly increased FC between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the right retrosplenial cortex, right precuneus/cuneus, and right middle cingulate cortex and between the right lateral parietal cortex (LP_R) and the right middle temporal gyrus. For FC within the FPN, compared with HC, IDH1-M showed significantly greater FC between the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC_R) and the right inferior, right medial, and right middle frontal gyrus, and IDH1-WT showed significantly increased FC between the PPC_R and the right middle frontal gyrus. For FC between the DMN and FPN, relative to IDH1-WT and HC, IDH1-M exhibited significantly increased FC between the LP_R and the right superior frontal gyrus and between the PPC_R and the right precuneus/cuneus. In contrast, compared to IDH1-M and HC, IDH1-WT showed significantly reduced FC between the PPC_R and the right angular gyrus. CONCLUSION: The preliminary findings revealed that there should be differences in the patterns of network reorganization between IDH1-M and IDH1-WT with different growth kinetics.

Title: What Can Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Explain about the Functional Brain Connectivity in Glioma Patients?
Abstract: Resting-state functional MRI has been increasingly implemented in imaging protocols for the study of functional connectivity in glioma patients as a sequence able to capture the activity of brain networks and to investigate their properties without requiring the patients' cooperation. The present review aims at describing the most recent results obtained through the analysis of resting-state fMRI data in different contexts of interest for brain gliomas: the identification and localization of functional networks, the characterization of altered functional connectivity, and the evaluation of functional plasticity in relation to the resection of the glioma. An analysis of the literature showed that significant and promising results could be achieved through this technique in all the aspects under investigation. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement, especially in terms of stability and generalizability of the outcomes. Further research should be conducted on homogeneous samples of glioma patients and at fixed time points to reduce the considerable variability in the results obtained across and within studies. Future works should also aim at establishing robust metrics for the assessment of the disruption of functional connectivity and its recovery at the single-subject level.

Title: Case Series of Applications of Resting State Functional MRI in Brain Tumor Surgery: A Novel Technique.
Abstract: Background  The extent of resection for brain tumors is a critical factor in determining the oncologic outcome for a patient. However, a balance between preservation of neurological function and maximal resection is essential for true benefit. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the approaches that augments the neurosurgeon's ability to attain maximal safe resection by providing preoperative mapping. It may not be possible to perform awake craniotomy with intraoperative localization by direct cortical stimulation in all patients, such as children and those with neurocognitive impairment. Task-based fMRI may have limited value in these cases due to low patient cooperability. Methods  In this article we present in a case-based format, the various clinical scenarios where resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can be helpful in guiding neurosurgical resection. rs-fMRI of the patients has been acquired on Philips 1.5 T system. Seed voxel method has been used for processing and analysis. Conclusion  rs-fMRI does not require active patient cooperation to generate useful information and thus can be a promising tool in patients unable to cooperate for task-based studies.

Title: Machine learning for post-traumatic stress disorder identification utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Abstract: Early detection of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is essential for proper treatment of the patients to recover from this disorder. The aligned purpose of this study was to investigate the performance deviations in regions of interest (ROI) of PTSD than the healthy brain regions, to assess interregional functional connectivity and applications of machine learning techniques to identify PTSD and healthy control using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The rs-fMRI data of 10 ROI was extracted from 14 approved PTSD subjects and 14 healthy controls. The rs-fMRI data of the selected ROI were used in ANOVA to measure performance level and Pearson's correlation to investigate the interregional functional connectivity in PTSD brains. In machine learning approaches, the logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with linear, radial basis function, and polynomial kernels were used to classify the PTSD and control subjects. The performance level in brain regions of PTSD deviated as compared to the regions in the healthy brain. In addition, significant positive or negative functional connectivity was observed among ROI in PTSD brains. The rs-fMRI data have been distributed in training, validation, and testing group for maturity, implementation of machine learning techniques. The KNN and SVM with radial basis function kernel were outperformed for classification among other methods with high accuracies (96.6%, 94.8%, 98.5%) and (93.7%, 95.2%, 99.2%) to train, validate, and test datasets, respectively. The study's findings may provide a guideline to observe performance and functional connectivity of the brain regions in PTSD and to discriminate PTSD subject using only the suggested algorithms.

Title: A prospective behavioral and imaging study exploring the impact on long-term memory of radiotherapy delivered for a brain tumor in childhood and adolescence.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa tumors represent two thirds of brain tumors in children. Although progress in treatment has improved survival rates over the past few years, long-term memory impairments in survivors are frequent and have an impact on academic achievement. The hippocampi, cerebellum and cerebellar-cortical networks play a role in several memory systems. They are affected not only by the location of the tumor itself and its surgical removal, but also by the supratentorial effects of complementary treatments, particularly radiotherapy. The IMPALA study will investigate the impact of irradiation doses on brain structures involved in memory, especially the hippocampi and cerebellum. METHODS/DESIGN: In this single-center prospective behavioral and neuro-imaging study, 90 participants will be enrolled in three groups. The first two groups will include patients who underwent surgery for a posterior fossa brain tumor in childhood, who are considered to be cured, and who completed treatment at least 5 years earlier, either with radiotherapy (aggressive brain tumor; Group 1) or without (low-grade brain tumor; Group 2). Group 3 will include control participants matched with Group 1 for age, sex, and handedness. All participants will perform an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including an assessment of the main memory systems, and undergo multimodal 3 T MRI. The irradiation dose to the different brain structures involved in memory will be collected from the initial radiotherapy dosimetry. DISCUSSION: This study will provide long-term neuropsychological data about four different memory systems (working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory) and the cognitive functions (attention, language, executive functions) that can interfere with them, in order to better characterize memory deficits among the survivors of brain tumors. We will investigate the correlations between neuropsychological and neuroimaging data on the structural (3DT1), microstructural (DTI), functional (rs-fMRI), vascular (ASL) and metabolic (spectroscopy) impact of the tumor and irradiation dose. This study will thus inform the setting of dose constraints to spare regions linked to the development of cognitive and memory functions.

Title: Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Surgical Neuro-Oncology Planning: Towards a Standardization in Clinical Settings.
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rest-f-MRI) is a neuroimaging technique that has demonstrated its potential in providing new insights into brain physiology. rest-f-MRI can provide useful information in pre-surgical mapping aimed to balancing long-term survival by maximizing the extent of resection of brain neoplasms, while preserving the patient's functional connectivity. Rest-fMRI may replace or can be complementary to task-driven fMRI (t-fMRI), particularly in patients unable to cooperate with the task paradigm, such as children or sedated, paretic, aphasic patients. Although rest-fMRI is still under standardization, this technique has been demonstrated to be feasible and valuable in the routine clinical setting for neurosurgical planning, along with intraoperative electrocortical mapping. In the literature, there is growing evidence that rest-fMRI can provide valuable information for the depiction of glioma-related functional brain network impairment. Accordingly, rest-fMRI could allow a tailored glioma surgery improving the surgeon's ability to increase the extent of resection (EOR), and simultaneously minimize the risk of damage of eloquent brain structures and neuronal networks responsible for the integrity of executive functions. In this article, we present a review of the literature and illustrate the feasibility of rest-fMRI in the clinical setting for presurgical mapping of eloquent networks in patients affected by brain tumors, before and after tumor resection.

Title: Automated eloquent cortex localization in brain tumor patients using multi-task graph neural networks.
Abstract: Localizing the eloquent cortex is a crucial part of presurgical planning. While invasive mapping is the gold standard, there is increasing interest in using noninvasive fMRI to shorten and improve the process. However, many surgical patients cannot adequately perform task-based fMRI protocols. Resting-state fMRI has emerged as an alternative modality, but automated eloquent cortex localization remains an open challenge. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning architecture to simultaneously identify language and primary motor cortex from rs-fMRI connectivity. Our approach uses the representational power of convolutional neural networks alongside the generalization power of multi-task learning to find a shared representation between the eloquent subnetworks. We validate our method on data from the publicly available Human Connectome Project and on a brain tumor dataset acquired at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. We compare our method against feature-based machine learning approaches and a fully-connected deep learning model that does not account for the shared network organization of the data. Our model achieves significantly better performance than competing baselines. We also assess the generalizability and robustness of our method. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our graph convolution architecture combined with multi-task learning and highlight the promise of using rs-fMRI as a presurgical mapping tool.

Title: Characterization of cognitive function in survivors of diffuse gliomas using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).
Abstract: As treatments for diffuse gliomas have advanced, survival for patients with gliomas has also increased. However, there remains limited knowledge on the relationships between brain connectivity and the lasting changes to cognitive function that glioma survivors often experience long after completing treatment. This resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study explored functional connectivity (FC) alterations associated with cognitive function in survivors of gliomas. In this pilot study, 22 patients (mean age 43.8 +/- 11.9) with diffuse gliomas who completed treatment within the past 10 years were evaluated using rs-fMRI and neuropsychological measures. Novel rs-fMRI analysis methods were used to account for missing brain in the resection cavity. FC relationships were assessed between cognitively impaired and non-impaired glioma patients, along with self-reported cognitive impairment, non-work daily functioning, and time with surgery. In the cognitively non-impaired patients, FC was stronger in the medial prefrontal cortex, rostral prefrontal cortex, and intraparietal sulcus compared to the impaired survivors. When examining non-work daily functioning, a positive correlation with FC was observed between the accumbens and the intracalcarine cortices, while a negative correlation with FC was observed between the parietal operculum cortex and the cerebellum. Additionally, worse self-reported cognitive impairment and worse non-work daily functioning were associated with increased FC between regions involved in cognition and sensorimotor processing. These preliminary findings suggest that neural correlates for cognitive and daily functioning in glioma patients can be revealed using rs-fMRI. Resting-state network alterations may serve as a biomarker for patients' cognition and functioning.

Title: BOLD asynchrony elucidates tumor burden in IDH-mutated gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gliomas comprise the most common type of primary brain tumor, are highly invasive, and often fatal. IDH-mutated gliomas are particularly challenging to image and there is currently no clinically accepted method for identifying the extent of tumor burden in these neoplasms. This uncertainty poses a challenge to clinicians who must balance the need to treat the tumor while sparing healthy brain from iatrogenic damage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect glioma-related asynchrony in vascular dynamics for distinguishing tumor from healthy brain. METHODS: Twenty-four stereotactically localized biopsies were obtained during open surgical resection from ten treatment-naive patients with IDH-mutated gliomas who received standard-of-care preoperative imaging as well as echo-planar resting-state BOLD fMRI. Signal intensity for BOLD asynchrony and standard-of-care imaging was compared to cell counts of total cellularity (H&E), tumor density (IDH1 & Sox2), cellular proliferation (Ki67), and neuronal density (NeuN), for each corresponding sample. RESULTS: BOLD asynchrony was directly related to total cellularity (H&E, P = 4 x 10-5), tumor density (IDH1, P = 4 x 10-5; Sox2, P = 3 x 10-5), cellular proliferation (Ki67, P = .002), and inversely related to neuronal density (NeuN, P = 1 x 10-4). CONCLUSIONS: Asynchrony in vascular dynamics, as measured by resting-state BOLD fMRI, correlates with tumor burden and provides a radiographic delineation of tumor boundaries in IDH-mutated gliomas.

Title: Lesion-Function Analysis from Multimodal Imaging and Normative Brain Atlases for Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Cognitive deficits are common in glioma patients following multimodality therapy, but the relative impact of different types and locations of treatment-related brain damage and recurrent tumors on cognition is not well understood. In 121 WHO Grade III/IV glioma patients, structural MRI, O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine FET-PET, and neuropsychological testing were performed at a median interval of 14 months (range, 1-214 months) after therapy initiation. Resection cavities, T1-enhancing lesions, T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, and FET-PET positive tumor sites were semi-automatically segmented and elastically registered to a normative, resting state (RS) fMRI-based functional cortical network atlas and to the JHU atlas of white matter (WM) tracts, and their influence on cognitive test scores relative to a cohort of matched healthy subjects was assessed. T2/FLAIR hyperintensities presumably caused by radiation therapy covered more extensive brain areas than the other lesion types and significantly impaired cognitive performance in many domains when affecting left-hemispheric RS-nodes and WM-tracts as opposed to brain tissue damage caused by resection or recurrent tumors. Verbal episodic memory proved to be especially vulnerable to T2/FLAIR abnormalities affecting the nodes and tracts of the left temporal lobe. In order to improve radiotherapy planning, publicly available brain atlases, in conjunction with elastic registration techniques, should be used, similar to neuronavigation in neurosurgery.

Title: Dexmedetomidine inhibits unstable motor network in patients with primary motor area gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sedative agents such as dexmedetomidine have been found to transiently exacerbate or unmask limb motor dysfunction in patients with eloquent area brain gliomas. The present study aims to investigate whether dexmedetomidine can inhibit motor plasticity in patients with glioma via fMRI. METHODS: 21 patients with brain glioma were prospectively recruited between September 2017 and December 2018. Patients were classified into pre-M1 (primary motor cortex) group (n=9), post-M1 group (n=6), and non-eloquent group (control group) (n=6) according to the tumor position related to M1. The hand movement task-fMRI and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) were performed before and after sedation using dexmedetomidine. The lateralization index (LI) of activation voxels and magnitude and the functional connectivity (FC) of motor network were compared before and after sedation and among different groups. RESULTS: Permanent postoperative motor deficit of the upper limb was found in 5 of 6 patients in the pre-M1 group, and none in other groups (P < .01). Task-fMRI showed the LI of activation volume and activation magnitude at M1 significantly increased only in the pre-M1 group after sedation (P < .05). Rs-fMRI showed 60.0% (27 of 45) FCs of motor network decreased in pre-M1 group after sedation (p[FDR] < .05); whereas there was no FC reduction in post-M1 and control groups (p[FDR] > .05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with eloquent area gliomas, dexmedetomidine can inhibit the unstable compensative motor plasticity on both task- and rs-fMRI. fMRI may be a promising method for elucidating the effect of sedative agents on motor plasticity.

Title: Machine learning may predict individual hand motor activation from resting-state fMRI in patients with brain tumors in perirolandic cortex.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the predictive validity of the neural network (NN) method for presurgical mapping of motor areas using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data of patients with brain tumor located in the perirolandic cortex (PRC). METHODS: A total of 109 patients with brain tumors occupying PRC underwent rs-fMRI and hand movement task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) scans. Using a NN model trained on fMRI data of 47 healthy controls, individual task activation maps were predicted from their rs-fMRI data. NN-predicted maps were compared with task activation and independent component analysis (ICA)-derived maps. Spatial Pearson's correlation coefficients (CC) matrices and Dice coefficients (DC) between task activation and predicted activation using NN (DC(NN_Act)) and ICA (DC(ICA_Act)) were calculated and compared using non-parametric tests. The effects of tumor types and head motion on predicted maps were demonstrated. RESULTS: The CC matrix of NN-predicted maps showed higher diagonal values compared with ICA-derived maps (p < 0.001). DC(NN_Act) were higher than DC(ICA_Act) (p < 0.001) for patients with or without motor deficits. Lower DCs were found in subjects with head motion greater than one voxel. DCs were higher on the nontumor side than on the tumor side (p < 0.001), especially in the glioma group compared with meningioma and metastatic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the NN approach could predict individual motor activation using rs-fMRI data and could have promising clinical applications in brain tumor patients with anatomical and functional reorganizations. KEY POINTS: * The neural network machine learning approach successfully predicted hand motor activation in patients with a tumor in the perirolandic cortex, despite space-occupying effects and possible functional reorganization. * Compared to the conventional independent component analysis, the neural network approach utilizing resting-state fMRI data yielded a higher correlation to the active task hand activation data. * The Dice coefficient of machine learning-predicted activation vs. task fMRI activation was different between tumor and nontumor side, also between tumor types, which might indicate different effects of possible neurovascular uncoupling on resting-state and task fMRI.

Title: The Functional Reorganization of Language Network Modules in Glioma Patients: New Insights From Resting State fMRI Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prior investigations of language functions have focused on the response profiles of particular brain regions. However, the specialized and static view of language processing does not explain numerous observations of functional recovery following brain surgery. To investigate the dynamic alterations of functional connectivity (FC) within language network (LN) in glioma patients, we explored a new flexible model based on the neuroscientific hypothesis of core-periphery organization in LN. METHODS: Group-level LN mapping was determined from 109 glioma patients and forty-two healthy controls (HCs) using independent component analysis (ICA). FC and mean network connectivity (mNC: l/rFCw, FCb, and FCg) were compared between patients and HCs. Correlations between mNC and tumor volume (TV) were calculated. RESULTS: We identified ten separate LN modules from ICA. Compared to HCs, glioma patients showed a significant reduction in language network functional connectivity (LNFC), with a distinct pattern modulated by tumor position. Left hemisphere gliomas had a broader impact on FC than right hemisphere gliomas, with more reduced edges away from tumor sites (p=0.011). mNC analysis revealed a significant reduction in all indicators of FC except for lFCw in right hemisphere gliomas. These alterations were associated with TV in a double correlative relationship depending on the tumor position across hemispheres. CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the modulatory effects of core-periphery mechanisms from a network perspective. Preoperative evaluation of changes in LN caused by gliomas could provide the surgeon a reference to optimize resection while maintaining functional balance.

Title: Case Report: Multimodal Functional and Structural Evaluation Combining Pre-operative nTMS Mapping and Neuroimaging With Intraoperative CT-Scan and Brain Shift Correction for Brain Tumor Surgical Resection.
Abstract: Background: Maximum safe resection of infiltrative brain tumors in eloquent area is the primary objective in surgical neuro-oncology. This goal can be achieved with direct electrical stimulation (DES) to perform a functional mapping of the brain in patients awake intraoperatively. When awake surgery is not possible, we propose a pipeline procedure that combines advanced techniques aiming at performing a dissection that respects the anatomo-functional connectivity of the peritumoral region. This procedure can benefit from intraoperative monitoring with computerized tomography scan (iCT-scan) and brain shift correction. Associated with this intraoperative monitoring, the additional value of preoperative investigation combining brain mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) with various neuroimaging modalities (tractography and resting state functional MRI) has not yet been reported. Case Report: A 42-year-old left-handed man had increased intracranial pressure (IICP), left hand muscle deficit, and dysarthria, related to an infiltrative tumor of the right frontal lobe with large mass effect and circumscribed contrast enhancement in motor and premotor cortical areas. Spectroscopy profile and intratumoral calcifications on CT-scan suggested an WHO grade III glioma, later confirmed by histology. The aforementioned surgical procedure was considered, since standard awake surgery was not appropriate for this patient. In preoperative time, nTMS mapping of motor function (deltoid, first interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles) was performed, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography reconstruction of 6 neural tracts (arcuate, corticospinal, inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and resting-state functional MRI connectivity (rs-fMRI) of sensorimotor and language networks. In intraoperative time, DES mapping was performed with motor evoked response recording and tumor resection was optimized using non-rigid image transformation of the preoperative data (nTMS, tractography, and rs-fMRI) to iCT data. Image guidance was updated with correction for brain shift and tissue deformation using biomechanical modeling taking into account brain elastic properties. This correction was done at crucial surgical steps, i.e., when tumor bulged through the craniotomy after dura mater opening and when approaching the presumed eloquent brain regions. This procedure allowed a total resection of the tumor region with contrast enhancement as well as a complete regression of IICP and dysarthria. Hand paresis remained stable with no additional deficit. Postoperative nTMS mapping confirmed the good functional outcome. Conclusion: This case report and technical note highlights the value of preoperative functional evaluation by nTMS updated intraoperatively with correction of brain deformation by iCT. This multimodal approach may become the optimized technique of reference for patients with brain tumors in eloquent areas that are unsuitable for awake brain surgery.

Title: Machine Learning Analytics of Resting-State Functional Connectivity Predicts Survival Outcomes of Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients.
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently occurring brain malignancy. Due to its poor prognosis with currently available treatments, there is a pressing need for easily accessible, non-invasive techniques to help inform pre-treatment planning, patient counseling, and improve outcomes. In this study we determined the feasibility of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) to classify GBM patients into short-term and long-term survival groups with respect to reported median survival (14.6 months). We used a support vector machine with rsFC between regions of interest as predictive features. We employed a novel hybrid feature selection method whereby features were first filtered using correlations between rsFC and OS, and then using the established method of recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select the optimal feature subset. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluated the performance of models. Classification between short- and long-term survival accuracy was 71.9%. Sensitivity and specificity were 77.1 and 65.5%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.752 (95% CI, 0.62-0.88). These findings suggest that highly specific features of rsFC may predict GBM survival. Taken together, the findings of this study support that resting-state fMRI and machine learning analytics could enable a radiomic biomarker for GBM, augmenting care and planning for individual patients.

Title: fMRI Resting-State Connectivity between Language and Nonlanguage Areas as Defined by Intraoperative Electrocortical Stimulation in Low-Grade Glioma Patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:  It remains to be determined whether noninvasive functional imaging techniques can rival the clinical potential of direct electrocortical stimulation (DES). In this study, we compared the results of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to those of DES for language mapping. Our goals were twofold: (1) to replicate a previous study that demonstrated that resting-state connectivity (RSC) was significantly larger between positive DES language sites than between negative DES language sites and (2) to compare the spatial resolution of rs-fMRI to that of DES. METHODS:  We conducted a retrospective study of nine low-grade glioma patients. Language sites were identified by intraoperative DES. We compared RSC values between and within groups of DES-positive and DES-negative regions of interest (ROIs). Both close-negative sites (i.e., DES-negative sites <1 cm apart from and on the same gyrus as DES-positive sites) and far-negative sites (i.e., purely randomly chosen sites not in the vicinity of the tumor or of the DES-positive sites but on the same lobe) were included. Receiver operating characteristics were used to quantify comparisons. RESULTS:  Functional connectivity between all positive language sites was on average significantly higher than between all close-negative sites and between all far-negative sites. The functional connectivity between the positive language ROIs and their respective close-negative control sites was not smaller than between all positive language sites. CONCLUSION:  rs-fMRI likely reflects similar neural information as detected with DES, but in its current form does not reach the spatial resolution of DES.

Title: Functional connectivity of the default mode, dorsal attention and fronto-parietal executive control networks in glial tumor patients.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is an emerging tool to explore the functional connectivity of different brain regions. We aimed to assess the disruption of functional connectivity of the Default Mode Network (DMN), Dorsal Attention Network(DAN) and Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN) in patients with glial tumors. METHODS: rsfMRI data acquired on 3T-MR of treatment-naive glioma patients prospectively recruited (2015-2019) and matched controls from the 1000 functional-connectomes-project were analyzed using the CONN functional toolbox. Seed-Based Connectivity Analysis (SBCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA, with 10 to 100 components) were performed to study reliably the three networks of interest. RESULTS: 35 patients with gliomas (17 WHO grade I-II, 18 grade III-IV) and 70 controls were included. Global increased DMN connectivity was consistently found with SBCA and ICA in patients compared to controls (Cluster1: Precuneus, height: p < 10(-6); Cluster2: subcallosum; height: p < 10(-5)). However, an area of decreased connectivity was found in the posterior corpus callosum, particularly in high-grade gliomas (height: p < 10(-5)). The DAN demonstrated small areas of increased connectivity in frontal and occipital regions (height: p < 10(-6)). For the FPN, increased connectivity was noted in the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and frontal cortex. No difference in the connectivity of the networks of interest was demonstrated between low- and high-grade gliomas, as well as when stratified by their IDH1-R132H (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutation status. CONCLUSION: Altered functional connectivity is reliably found with SBCA and ICA in the DMN, DAN, and FPN in glioma patients, possibly explained by decreased connectivity between the cerebral hemispheres across the corpus callosum due to disruption of the connections.

Title: Hemisphere-Specific Functional Remodeling and Its Relevance to Tumor Malignancy of Cerebral Glioma Based on Resting-State Functional Network Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Functional remodeling may vary with tumor aggressiveness of glioma. Investigation of the functional remodeling is expected to provide scientific relevance of tumor characterization and disease management of glioma. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional remodeling of the contralesional hemisphere and its utility in predicting the malignant grade of glioma at the individual level with multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six right-handed subjects with histologically confirmed cerebral glioma were included with 80 tumors located in the left hemisphere (LH) and 46 tumors located in the right hemisphere (RH). Resting-state functional networks of the contralesional hemisphere were constructed using the human brainnetome atlas based on resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity and topological features of functional networks were quantified. The performance of functional features in predicting the glioma grade was evaluated using area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. Features with high AUC values in malignancy classification in the training dataset were determined as predictive features. An MLR model was constructed based on predictive features and its classification performance was evaluated on the training and validation datasets with 10-fold cross validation. RESULTS: Predictive functional features showed apparent hemispheric specifications. MLR classification models constructed with age and predictive functional connectivity features (AUC of 0.853 +/- 0.079 and 1.000 +/- 0.000 for LH and RH group, respectively) and topological features (AUC of 0.788 +/- 0.150 and 0.897 +/- 0.165 for LH and RH group, respectively) achieved efficient performance in predicting the malignant grade of gliomas. CONCLUSION: Functional remodeling of the contralesional hemisphere was hemisphere-specific and highly predictive of the malignant grade of glioma. Network approach provides a novel pathway that may innovate glioma characterization and management at the individual level.

Title: Glioma-Induced Disruption of Resting-State Functional Connectivity and Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in the Salience Network.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive challenges are prevalent in survivors of glioma, but their neurobiology is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of glioma presence and tumor characteristics on resting-state functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of the salience network, a key neural network associated with cognition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with glioma (mean age, 48.74 [SD, 14.32] years) who underwent resting-state fMRI were compared with 31 healthy controls (mean age, 49.68 [SD, 15.54] years). We identified 4 salience network ROIs: left/right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left/right anterior insula. Average salience network resting-state functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations within the 4 salience network ROIs were computed. RESULTS: Patients with gliomas showed decreased overall salience network resting-state functional connectivity (P = .001) and increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in all salience network ROIs (P < .01) except in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Compared with controls, patients with left-sided gliomas showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (P = .002) and right anterior insula (P < .001), and patients with right-sided gliomas showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left anterior insula (P = .002). Anterior tumors were associated with decreased salience network resting-state functional connectivity (P < .001) and increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right anterior insula, left anterior insula, and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Patients with high-grade gliomas had decreased salience network resting-state functional connectivity compared with healthy controls (P < .05). The right anterior insula showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in patients with grade II and IV gliomas compared with controls (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: By demonstrating decreased resting-state functional connectivity and an increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations related to the salience network in patients with glioma, this study adds to our understanding of the neurobiology underpinning observable cognitive deficits in these patients. In addition to more conventional functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations is a promising functional-imaging biomarker of tumor-induced vascular and neural pathology.

Title: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation following awake craniotomy for resection of glioma: Description of two cases.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been indicated as a potential therapy for several neurologic conditions, there is little known regarding its use during the postoperative rehabilitation period in patients with brain tumors. Furthermore, seizures, a common presentation in these patients, are regarded as a major contraindication for TMS therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: We demonstrate that postoperative continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a patterned form of repetitive TMS, was safely tolerated in addition to current neurorehabilitation techniques in two brain tumor patients, including one patient with a history of tumor-related epilepsy. We administered navigated 5 Hz cTBS to two patients within 48 h following awake craniotomy for tumor resection. Active motor thresholds were measured in both patients before TBS administration to determine stimulus intensity. We used resting-state fMRI to identify likely damaged networks based on postoperative deficits. This aided in TMS planning and allowed deficit targeted therapy contralateral to the lesioned network node. Both patients tolerated TBS therapy well and had no adverse effects, including posttreatment seizures, despite one patient having a history of tumor-related epilepsy. CONCLUSION: TBS may be safe in the immediate postoperative period for patients following brain tumor resection. Additional studies are needed to quantify the efficacy of TMS in improving neurologic deficits following tumor resection.

Title: Preoperative Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Glioma Patients: A Proof of Concept Pilot Study.
Abstract: Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used extensively in patient populations to facilitate motor network plasticity. However, it has not been studied in patients with brain tumors. We aimed to determine the feasibility of a preoperative motor training and tDCS intervention in patients with glioma. In an exploratory manner, we assessed changes in motor network connectivity following this intervention and related these changes to predicted electrical field strength from the stimulated motor cortex. Methods: Patients with left-sided glioma (n=8) were recruited in an open label proof of concept pilot trial and participated in four consecutive days of motor training combined with tDCS. The motor training consisted of a 60-min period where the subject learned to play the piano with their right hand. Concurrently, they received 40 min of 2 mA anodal tDCS of the left motor cortex. Patients underwent task and resting state fMRI before and after this intervention. Changes in both the connectivity of primary motor cortex (M1) and general connectivity across the brain were assessed. Patient specific finite element models were created and the predicted electrical field (EF) resulting from stimulation was computed. The magnitude of the EF was extracted from left M1 and correlated to the observed changes in functional connectivity. Results: There were no adverse events and all subjects successfully completed the study protocol. Left M1 increased both local and global connectivity. Voxel-wide measures, not constrained by a specific region, revealed increased global connectivity of the frontal pole and decreased global connectivity of the supplementary motor area. The magnitude of EF applied to the left M1 correlated with changes in global connectivity of the right M1. Conclusion: In this proof of concept pilot study, we demonstrate for the first time that tDCS appears to be feasible in glioma patients. In our exploratory analysis, we show preoperative motor training combined with tDCS may alter sensorimotor network connectivity. Patient specific modeling of EF in the presence of tumor may contribute to understanding the dose-response relationship of this intervention. Overall, this suggests the possibility of modulating neural networks in glioma patients.

Title: Personalized Multimodal Demarcation of Peritumoral Tissue in Glioma.
Abstract: PURPOSE: Gliomas are life-threatening brain tumors, and the extent of surgical resection is one of the strongest influences on survival rate. However, the proper distinction of infiltrated tissue remains elusive. The aim of this study was to use multimodal analyses to demarcate peritumoral tissue (PT) from tumoral (TT) and healthy tissue (HT). METHODS: A total of 40 patients with histologically confirmed glioma were recruited. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) using the voxel-based mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal and the corresponding structural MRI (s-MRI) alongside RNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and histology results of biopsy samples obtained from PT, HT, and TT. RESULTS: We demarcated a functionally defined PT area where the mean BOLD signal gradually decreased near the edge of the tumor and extended beyond the TT borders (as defined by s-MRI), which was confirmed on a case-by-case basis. Correspondingly, genetic analyses showed a gene expression pattern and mutational landscape of the PT that were distinct from that seen in HT and TT. The genetic characterization of PT relative to HT and TT converged with the MRI-defined PT zones. This was confirmed in three individual cases after additional histologic analysis. A wider PT was associated with a longer progression-free survival, which suggests PT might act as an intermediate area between TT and HT. CONCLUSION: Combined multimodal imaging and genetic analyses can allow for an objective demarcation of the PT in glioma and a robust classification of the degree of infiltration of the PT. These findings could help improve both neurosurgical resection and radio-oncologic therapy.

Title: Alterations in Functional Connectomics Associated With Neurocognitive Changes Following Glioma Resection.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Decline in neurocognitive functioning (NCF) often occurs following brain tumor resection. Functional connectomics have shown how neurologic insults disrupt cerebral networks underlying NCF, though studies involving patients with brain tumors are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of brain tumor resection upon the connectome and relationships with NCF outcome in the early postoperative period. METHODS: A total of 15 right-handed adults with left perisylvian glioma underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessment before and after awake tumor resection. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to rs-fMRI connectivity matrices to calculate network properties. Network properties and NCF measures were compared across the pre- to postoperative periods with matched pairs Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Associations between pre- to postoperative change in network and NCF measures were determined with Spearman rank-order correlations (rho). RESULTS: A majority of the sample showed postoperative decline on 1 or more NCF measures. Significant postoperative NCF decline was found across measures of verbal memory, processing speed, executive functioning, receptive language, and a composite index. Regarding connectomic properties, betweenness centrality and assortativity were significantly smaller postoperatively, and reductions in these measures were associated with better NCF outcomes. Significant inverse associations (rho = -.51 to -.78, all P < .05) were observed between change in language, executive functioning, and learning and memory, and alterations in segregation, centrality, and resilience network properties. CONCLUSION: Decline in NCF was common shortly following resection of glioma involving eloquent brain regions, most frequently in verbal learning/memory and executive functioning. Better postoperative outcomes accompanied reductions in centrality and resilience connectomic measures.

Title: Epilepsy-Related Brain Network Alterations in Patients With Temporal Lobe Glioma in the Left Hemisphere.
Abstract: Background: Seizures are a common symptom in patients with temporal lobe gliomas and may result in brain network alterations. However, brain network changes caused by glioma-related epilepsy (GRE) remain poorly understood. Objective: In this study, we applied graph theory analysis to delineate topological networks with resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) and investigated characteristics of functional networks in patients with GRE. Methods: Thirty patients with low-grade gliomas in the left temporal lobe were enrolled and classified into GRE (n = 15) and non-GRE groups. Twenty healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education level were enrolled. All participants had rs-fMRI data. Sensorimotor, visual, default mode, auditory, and right executive control networks were used to construct connection matrices. Topological properties of those sub-networks were investigated. Results: Compared to that in the GRE group, four edges with higher functional connectivity were noted in the non-GRE group. Moreover, 21 edges with higher functional connectivity were identified in the non-GRE group compared to the healthy group. All significant alterations in functional edges belong to the visual network. Increased global efficiency and decreased shortest path lengths were noted in the non-GRE group compared to the GRE and healthy groups. Compared with that in the healthy group, nodal efficiency of three nodes was higher in the GRE and non-GRE groups and the degree centrality of six nodes was altered in the non-GRE group. Conclusion: Temporal lobe gliomas in the left hemisphere and GRE altered visual networks in an opposing manner. These findings provide a novel insight into brain network alterations induced by GRE.

Title: [Resting-state fMRI in preoperative non-invasive mapping in patients with left hemisphere glioma].
Abstract: Maximum resection and preservation of neurological function are main principles in surgery of brain tumors, especially glial neoplasms with diffuse growth. Therefore, exact localizing of eloquent brain areas is an important component in surgical planning ensuring optimal resection with minimal postoperative neurological deficit. Functional MRI is used to localize eloquent brain areas adjacent to the tumor. This paper is an initial stage in analysis of resting-state fMRI in assessment of functional changes of neuronal activity caused by brain gliomas of different localization. We report two patients with glial tumors localized within the precentral gyrus of the left hemisphere and near speech area. Considering data of task-based and resting-state fMRI, as well as direct cortical stimulation, we propose a methodology for assessing the overlap of activations obtained by these methods.

Title: Asymmetric tumor-related alterations of network-specific intrinsic functional connectivity in glioma patients.
Abstract: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) allows mapping temporally coherent brain networks, and intra- and inter-network alterations have been described in different diseases. This prospective study investigated hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences in the default-mode network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network (FPN) between patients with left- and right-hemispheric gliomas (LH PAT, RH PAT), addressing asymmetry effects the tumor might have on network-specific intrinsic functional connectivity under consideration of the prognostically relevant isocitrate-dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. Twenty-seven patients (16 LH PAT, 12 IDH-wildtype) and 27 healthy controls underwent anatomical and rs-fMRI as well as neuropsychological assessment. Independent component analyses were performed to identify the DMN and FPN. Hemispheric DMN- and FPN-RSFC were computed, compared across groups, and correlated with cognitive performance. Patient groups did not differ in tumor volume, grade or location. RH PAT showed higher contra-tumoral DMN-RSFC than controls and LH PAT. With regard to the FPN, contra-tumoral RSFC was increased in both patient groups as compared to controls. Higher contra-tumoral RSFC was associated with worse cognitive performance in patients, which, however, seemed to apply mainly to IDH-wildtype patients. The benefit of RSFC alterations for cognitive performance varied depending on the affected hemisphere, cognitive demand, and seemed to be altered by IDH-mutation status. At the time of study initiation, a clinical trial registration was not mandatory at our faculty, but it can be applied for if requested.

Title: The role of resting-state functional MRI for clinical preoperative language mapping.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) is a well-established technique used to identify eloquent cortex, but has limitations, particularly in cognitively impaired patients who cannot perform language paradigms. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a potential alternative modality for presurgical mapping of language networks that does not require task performance. The purpose of our study is to determine the utility of rs-fMRI for clinical preoperative language mapping when tb-fMRI is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 134 brain tumor patients who underwent preoperative fMRI language mapping. rs-fMRI was post-processed with seed-based correlation (SBC) analysis, when language tb-fMRI was limited. Two neuroradiologists reviewed both the tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI results. Six neurosurgeons retrospectively rated the usefulness of rs-fMRI for language mapping in their patients. RESULTS: Of the 134 patients, 49 cases had limited tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI was post-processed. Two neuroradiologists found rs-fMRI beneficial for functional language mapping in 41(84%) and 43 (88%) cases respectively; Cohen's kappa is 0.83, with a 95% confidence interval (0.61, 1.00). The neurosurgeons found rs-fMRI "definitely" useful in 26 cases (60%) and "somewhat" useful in 13 cases (30%) in locating potential eloquent language centers of clinical interest. Six unsuccessful rs-fMRI cases were due to: head motion (2 cases), nonspecific functionality connectivity outside the posterior language network (1 case), and an unknown system instability (3 cases). CONCLUSIONS: This study is a proof of concept that shows SBC rs-fMRI may be a viable alternative for clinical language mapping when tb-fMRI is limited.

Title: Role of the default mode resting-state network for cognitive functioning in malignant glioma patients following multimodal treatment.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Progressive cognitive decline following multimodal neurooncological treatment is a common observation in patients suffering from malignant glioma. Alterations of the default-mode network (DMN) represent a possible source of impaired neurocognitive functioning and were analyzed in these patients. METHODS: Eighty patients (median age, 51 years) with glioma (WHO grade IV glioblastoma, n = 57; WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, n = 13; WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma, n = 10) and ECOG performance score 0-1 underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological testing at a median interval of 13 months (range, 1-114 months) after initiation of therapy. For evaluation of structural and metabolic changes after treatment, anatomical MRI and amino acid PET using O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) were simultaneously acquired to rs-fMRI on a hybrid MR/PET scanner. A cohort of 80 healthy subjects matched for gender, age, and educational status served as controls. RESULTS: The connectivity pattern within the DMN (12 nodes) of the glioma patients differed significantly from that of the healthy subjects but did not depend on age, tumor grade, time since treatment initiation, presence of residual/recurrent tumor, number of chemotherapy cycles received, or anticonvulsive medication. Small changes in the connectivity pattern were observed in patients who had more than one series of radiotherapy. In contrast, structural tissue changes located at or near the tumor site (including resection cavities, white matter lesions, edema, and tumor tissue) had a strong negative impact on the functional connectivity of the adjacent DMN nodes, resulting in a marked dependence of the connectivity pattern on tumor location. In the majority of neurocognitive domains, glioma patients performed significantly worse than healthy subjects. Correlation analysis revealed that reduced connectivity in the left temporal and parietal DMN nodes was associated with low performance in language processing and verbal working memory. Furthermore, connectivity of the left parietal DMN node also correlated with processing speed, executive function, and verbal as well as visual working memory. Overall DMN connectivity loss and cognitive decline were less pronounced in patients with higher education. CONCLUSION: Personalized treatment strategies for malignant glioma patients should consider the left parietal and temporal DMN nodes as vulnerable regions concerning neurocognitive outcome.

Title: Tumor grade-related language and control network reorganization in patients with left cerebral glioma.
Abstract: Language processing relies on both a functionally specialized language network and a domain-general cognitive control network. Yet, how the two networks reorganize after damage resulting from diffuse and progressive glioma remains largely unknown. To address this issue, 130 patients with left cerebral gliomas, including 77 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG, WHO grade Ⅰ/II), 53 patients with high-grade glioma (HGG, WHO grade III/IV) and 38 healthy controls (HC) were adopted. The changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the language network and the cingulo-opercular/fronto-parietal (CO-FP) network were examined using network-based statistics. We found that tumor grade negatively correlated with language scores and language network integrity. Compared with HCs, patients with LGGs exhibited slight language deficits, both decreased and increased changes in rsFC of language network, and nearly normal CO-FP network. Patients with HGGs had significantly lower language scores than those with LGG and exhibited more severe language and CO-FP network disruptions than HCs or patients with LGGs. Moreover, we found that in patients with HGGs, the decreased rsFCs of language network were positively correlated with language scores. Together, our findings suggest tumor grade-related network reorganization of both language and control networks underlie the different levels of language impairments observed in patients with gliomas.

Title: Resting-State Functional Connectome in Patients with Brain Tumors Before and After Surgical Resection.
Abstract: PURPOSE: High-grade glioma surgery has evolved around the principal belief that a safe maximal tumor resection improves symptoms, quality of life, and survival. Mapping brain function has been recently improved by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rest-fMRI), a novel imaging technique that explores networks connectivity at "rest." METHODS: This prospective study analyzed 10 patients with high-grade glioma in whom rest-fMRI connectivity was assessed both in single-subject and in group analysis before and after surgery. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed with CONN toolbox. Network identification focused on 8 major functional connectivity networks. A voxel-wise region of interest (ROI) to ROI correlation map to assess functional connectivity throughout the whole brain was computed from a priori seeds ROI in specific resting-state networks before and after surgical resection in each patient. RESULTS: Reliable topography of all 8 resting-state networks was successfully identified in each participant before surgical resection. Single-subject functional connectivity analysis showed functional disconnection for dorsal attention and salience networks, whereas the language network demonstrated functional connection either in the case of left temporal glioblastoma. Functional connectivity in group analysis showed wide variations of functional connectivity in the default mode, salience, and sensorimotor networks. However, salience and language networks, salience and default mode networks, and salience and sensorimotor networks showed a significant correlation (P uncorrected <0.0025; P false discovery rate <0.077) in comparison before and after surgery confirming non-disconnection of these networks. CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state fMRI can reliably detect common functional connectivity networks in patients with glioma and has the potential to anticipate network alterations after surgical resection.

Title: Presurgical Localization of the Primary Sensorimotor Cortex in Gliomas : When is Resting State FMRI Beneficial and Sufficient?
Abstract: PURPOSE: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has an established role in neurosurgical planning; however, ambiguity surrounds the comparative value of resting and task-based fMRI relative to anatomical localization of the sensorimotor cortex. This study was carried out to determine: 1) how often fMRI adds to prediction of motor risks beyond expert neuroradiological review, 2) success rates of presurgical resting and task-based sensorimotor mapping, and 3) the impact of accelerated resting fMRI acquisitions on network detectability. METHODS: Data were collected at 2 centers from 71 patients with a primary brain tumor (31 women; mean age 41.9 +/- 13.9 years) and 14 healthy individuals (6 women; mean age 37.9 +/- 12.7 years). Preoperative 3T MRI included anatomical scans and resting fMRI using unaccelerated (TR = 3.5 s), intermediate (TR = 1.56 s) or high temporal resolution (TR = 0.72 s) sequences. Task fMRI finger tapping data were acquired in 45 patients. Group differences in fMRI reproducibility, spatial overlap and success frequencies were assessed with t‑tests and chi(2)-tests. RESULTS: Radiological review identified the central sulcus in 98.6% (70/71) patients. Task-fMRI succeeded in 100% (45/45). Resting fMRI failed to identify a sensorimotor network in up to 10 patients; it succeeded in 97.9% (47/48) of accelerated fMRIs, compared to only 60.9% (14/23) of unaccelerated fMRIs ([Formula: see text](2) = 17.84, p < 0.001). Of the patients 12 experienced postoperative deterioration, largely predicted by anatomical proximity to the central sulcus. CONCLUSION: The use of fMRI in patients with residual or intact presurgical motor function added value to uncertain anatomical localization in just a single peri-Rolandic glioma case. Resting fMRI showed high correspondence to task localization when acquired with accelerated sequences but offered limited success at standard acquisitions.

Title: Resting-state fMRI detects alterations in whole brain connectivity related to tumor biology in glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Systemic infiltration of the brain by tumor cells is a hallmark of glioma pathogenesis which may cause disturbances in functional connectivity. We hypothesized that aggressive high-grade tumors cause more damage to functional connectivity than low-grade tumors. METHODS: We designed an imaging tool based on resting-state functional (f)MRI to individually quantify abnormality of functional connectivity and tested it in a prospective cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioma. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were analyzed (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II, n = 13; grade III, n = 6; grade IV, n = 15; mean age, 48.7 y). Connectivity abnormality could be observed not only in the lesioned brain area but also in the contralateral hemisphere with a close correlation between connectivity abnormality and aggressiveness of the tumor as indicated by WHO grade. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status was also associated with abnormal connectivity, with more alterations in IDH1 wildtype tumors independent of tumor size. Finally, deficits in neuropsychological performance were correlated with connectivity abnormality. CONCLUSION: Here, we suggested an individually applicable resting-state fMRI marker in glioma patients. Analysis of the functional connectome using this marker revealed that abnormalities of functional connectivity could be detected not only adjacent to the visible lesion but also in distant brain tissue, even in the contralesional hemisphere. These changes were associated with tumor biology and cognitive function. The ability of our novel method to capture tumor effects in nonlesional brain suggests a potential clinical value for both individualizing and monitoring glioma therapy.

Title: Sex Effect on Presurgical Language Mapping in Patients With a Brain Tumor.
Abstract: Differences between males and females in brain development and in the organization and hemispheric lateralization of brain functions have been described, including in language. Sex differences in language organization may have important implications for language mapping performed to assess, and minimize neurosurgical risk to, language function. This study examined the effect of sex on the activation and functional connectivity of the brain, measured with presurgical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) language mapping in patients with a brain tumor. We carried out a retrospective analysis of data from neurosurgical patients treated at our institution who met the criteria of pathological diagnosis (malignant brain tumor), tumor location (left hemisphere), and fMRI paradigms [sentence completion (SC); antonym generation (AG); and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)]. Forty-seven patients (22 females, mean age = 56.0 years) were included in the study. Across the SC and AG tasks, females relative to males showed greater activation in limited areas, including the left inferior frontal gyrus classically associated with language. In contrast, males relative to females showed greater activation in extended areas beyond the classic language network, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and precentral gyrus. The rs-fMRI functional connectivity of the left SMA in the females was stronger with inferior temporal pole (TP) areas, and in the males with several midline areas. The findings are overall consistent with theories of greater reliance on specialized language areas in females relative to males, and generalized brain areas in males relative to females, for language function. Importantly, the findings suggest that sex could affect fMRI language mapping. Thus, considering sex as a variable in presurgical language mapping merits further investigation.

Title: Limitations of functional neuroimaging for patient selection and surgical planning in glioma surgery.
Abstract: The optimal surgical management of gliomas requires a balance between surgical cytoreduction and preservation of neurological function. Preoperative functional neuroimaging, such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has emerged as a possible tool to inform patient selection and surgical planning. However, evidence that preoperative fMRI or DTI improves extent of resection, limits neurological morbidity, and broadens surgical indications in classically eloquent areas is lacking. In this review, the authors describe facets of functional neuroimaging techniques that may limit their impact on neurosurgical oncology and critically evaluate the evidence supporting fMRI and DTI for patient selection and operative planning in glioma surgery. The authors also propose alternative applications for functional neuroimaging in the care of glioma patients.

Title: Resting state network plasticity related to picture naming in low-grade glioma patients before and after resection.
Abstract: The dynamic connectome perspective states that brain functions arise from the functional integration of distributed and/or partly overlapping networks. Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) have a slow infiltrating character. Here we addressed whether and how anatomical disconnection following DLGG growth and resection might interfere with functional resting-state connectivity, specifically in relation to picture naming. Thirty-nine native French persons with a left DLGG were included. All underwent awake surgical resection of the tumor using direct brain electrostimulation to preserve critical eloquent regions. The anatomical disconnectivity risk following the DLGG volume and the resection, and the functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI images in relation to picture naming were evaluated prior to and three months after surgery. Resting-state connectivity patterns were compared with nineteen healthy controls. It was demonstrated that picture naming was strongly dependent on the semantic network that emerged from the integration and interaction of regions within multiple resting-state brain networks, in which their specific role could be explained in the light of the broader resting-state network they take part in. It emphasized the importance of a whole brain approach with specific clinical data input, during resting-state analysis in case of lesion. Adaptive plasticity was found in secondary regions, functionally connected to regions close to the tumor and/or cavity, marked by an increased connectivity of the right and left inferior parietal lobule with the left inferior temporal gyrus. In addition, an important role was identified for the superior parietal lobe, connected with the frontal operculum, suggesting functional compensation by means of attentional resources in order to name a picture via recruitment of the frontoparietal attention network.

Title: Resting-state functional connectivity predicts individual language impairment of patients with left hemispheric gliomas involving language network.
Abstract: Language deficits following brain tumors should consider the dynamic interactions between different tumor growth kinetics and functional network reorganization. We measured the resting-state functional connectivity of 126 patients with left cerebral gliomas involving language network areas, including 77 patients with low-grade gliomas (LGG) and 49 patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG). Functional network mapping for language was performed by construction of a multivariate machine learning-based prediction model of individual aphasia quotient (AQ), a summary score that indicates overall severity of language impairment. We found that the AQ scores for HGG patients were significantly lower than those of LGG patients. The prediction accuracy of HGG patients (R(2) = 0.27, permutation P = 0.007) was much higher than that of LGG patients (R(2) = 0.09, permutation P = 0.032). The rsFC regions predictive of LGG's AQ involved the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, subcortical regions, and bilateral cerebro-cerebellar connections, mainly in regions belonging to the canonical language network. The functional network of language processing for HGG patients showed strong dependence on connections of the left cerebro-cerebellar connections, limbic system, and the temporal, occipital, and prefrontal lobes. Together, our findings suggested that individual language processing of glioma patients links large-scale, bilateral, cortico-subcortical, and cerebro-cerebellar functional networks with different network reorganizational mechanisms underlying the different levels of language impairments in LGG and HGG patients.

Title: Real-time presurgical resting-state fMRI in patients with brain tumors: Quality control and comparison with task-fMRI and intraoperative mapping.
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a promising task-free functional imaging approach, which may complement or replace task-based fMRI (tfMRI) in patients who have difficulties performing required tasks. However, rsfMRI is highly sensitive to head movement and physiological noise, and validation relative to tfMRI and intraoperative electrocortical mapping is still necessary. In this study, we investigate (a) the feasibility of real-time rsfMRI for presurgical mapping of eloquent networks with monitoring of data quality in patients with brain tumors and (b) rsfMRI localization of eloquent cortex compared with tfMRI and intraoperative electrocortical stimulation (ECS) in retrospective analysis. Five brain tumor patients were studied with rsfMRI and tfMRI on a clinical 3T scanner using MultiBand(8)-echo planar imaging (EPI) with repetition time: 400 ms. Moving-averaged sliding-window correlation analysis with regression of motion parameters and signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid was used to map sensorimotor and language resting-state networks. Data quality monitoring enabled rapid optimization of scan protocols, early identification of task noncompliance, and head movement-related false-positive connectivity to determine scan continuation or repetition. Sensorimotor and language resting-state networks were identifiable within 1 min of scan time. The Euclidean distance between ECS and rsfMRI connectivity and task-activation in motor cortex, Broca's, and Wernicke's areas was 5-10 mm, with the exception of discordant rsfMRI and ECS localization of Wernicke's area in one patient due to possible cortical reorganization and/or altered neurovascular coupling. This study demonstrates the potential of real-time high-speed rsfMRI for presurgical mapping of eloquent cortex with real-time data quality control, and clinically acceptable concordance of rsfMRI with tfMRI and ECS localization.

Title: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging versus task-based activity for language mapping and correlation with perioperative cortical mapping.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Preoperative language mapping using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) aims to identify eloquent areas in the vicinity of surgically resectable brain lesions. fMRI methodology relies on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) analysis to identify brain language areas. Task-based fMRI studies the BOLD signal increase in brain areas during a language task to identify brain language areas, which requires patients' cooperation, whereas resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) allows identification of functional networks without performing any explicit task through the analysis of the synchronicity of spontaneous BOLD signal oscillation between brain areas. The aim of this study was to compare preoperative language mapping using rsfMRI and task fMRI to cortical mapping (CM) during awake craniotomies. METHODS: Fifty adult patients surgically treated for a brain lesion were enrolled. All patients had a presurgical language mapping with both task fMRI and rsfMRI. Identified language networks were compared to perioperative language mapping using electric cortical stimulation. RESULTS: Resting-state fMRI was able to detect brain language areas during CM with a sensitivity of 100% compared to 65.6% with task fMRI. However, we were not able to perform a specificity analysis and compare task-based and rest fMRI with our perioperative setting in the current study. In second-order analysis, task fMRI imaging included main nodes of the SN and main areas involved in semantics were identified in rsfMRI. CONCLUSION: Resting-state fMRI for presurgical language mapping is easy to implement, allowing the identification of functional brain language network with a greater sensitivity than task-based fMRI, at the cost of some precautions and a lower specificity. Further study is required to compare both the sensitivity and the specificity of the two methods and to evaluate the clinical value of rsfMRI as an alternative tool for the presurgical identification of brain language areas.

Title: Abnormal Neural Activity in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma Had Manifested Deficit in Behavioral Inhibition: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study.
Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether alterations of regional neural function in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) had manifested deficit in behavioral inhibition using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). METHODS: There were 17 participants with DIPG who took part in the study. Eight children were with deficit in behavioral inhibition, whereas the other 9 children did not obtain deficit in behavioral inhibition. Five healthy children with age, sex, and education matched to the study group also participated as the control group. These 3 groups underwent rs-fMRI, and the results were then converted to amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) data. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation data were further analyzed by single-factor analysis of variance comparing among 3 groups based on the whole brain levels. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation results were subjected to t test of voxel-wised comparison to derive the rs-fMRI brain function differences between the 2 DIPG groups. The Pearson correlation between ALFF values of abnormal regions found in 3 groups and the scores obtained according to the Child Behavior Checklist were analyzed. RESULTS: The 3 groups had shown significant differences in terms of the ALFF results, with the ALFF increased in several brain regions (P < 0.05, corrected with AlphaSim, clusters >59 voxels), which include left supramarginal gyrus, left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. Participants with deficit in behavioral inhibition had shown significant differences (ALFF decreased) in several brain regions, including left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and right fusiform gyrus (P < 0.05, corrected with AlphaSim, clusters >123 voxels), whereas other brain regions had shown ALFF increased, including left supramarginal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right medial superior frontal gyrus (P < 0.05, corrected with AlphaSim, clusters >123 voxels). There was no significant correlation between ALFF values and Child Behavior Checklist scores (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings of focal spontaneous hyperfunction and hypofunction, which correlate with deficit in behavioral inhibition processing, and the abnormal brain regions are considered to be inefficient (in regions of the brain that may relate to compensatory brain and behavioral functioning, and it may be that the brain region needs to exert extra energy to perform a task to the same degree as the control group) or inability (inability in a certain region, or underpowered), pointing to a pathophysiologic process in executive dysfunction.

Title: Resting State Functional Connectivity of the Supplementary Motor Area to Motor and Language Networks in Patients with Brain Tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in brain tumor patients. We compared the SMA subdivisions (pre-SMA, SMA proper, central SMA) in terms of RSFC projected from each region to the motor gyrus and language areas. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 14 brain tumor patients who underwent task-based and resting-state fMRI, and who completed motor and language paradigms that activated the SMA proper and pre-SMA, respectively. Regions of interest (ROIs) obtained from task-based fMRI were generated in both areas and the central SMA to produce RSFC maps. Degree of RSFC was measured from each subdivision to the motor gyrus and Broca's area (BA). RESULTS: All patients showed RSFC between the pre-SMA and language centers and between the SMA proper and motor gyrus. Thirteen of 14 patients showed RSFC from the central SMA to both motor and language areas. There was no significant difference between subdivisions in degree of RSFC to BA (pre-SMA, r = .801; central SMA, r = .803; SMA proper; r = .760). The pre-SMA showed significantly less RSFC to the motor gyrus (r = .732) compared to the central SMA (r = .842) and SMA proper (r = .883) (P = .016, P = .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The region between the pre-SMA and SMA proper produces reliable RSFC to the motor gyrus and language areas in brain tumor patients. This study is the first to examine RSFC of the central SMA in this population. Consequently, our results provide further validation to previous studies, supporting the existence of a central SMA with connectivity to both motor and language networks.

Title: Seed-Based Connectivity Analysis of Resting-State fMRI in Patients with Brain Tumors: A Feasibility Study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In this study, we present our experience using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in preoperative planning. We performed group analysis to demonstrate the effects of brain tumor on resting-state networks (RSNs). METHODS: Thirty patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in the study. Preoperative rs-fMRI and structural magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all cases. The rs-fMRI was preprocessed (realignment, slice time correction, coregistration to structural images, normalization, and smoothing). The structural images were segmented and normalized. Band filtering and denoising were applied to the functional images. Connectivity analysis was performed using seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) at single subject level and group level. Correlation algorism has been used with r > 0.5. RESULTS: RSNs could be detected in all patients. They showed similarity to the results of the task-based fMRI, when task-based fMRI was feasible. Detection of the networks was also possible in patients with neurologic deficits, in whom task-based fMRI was not possible. We could use SCA in patients under anesthesia. High-level networks (default mode, salience, and dorsal attention networks) were detectable but showed a wide spectrum of spatial alterations and component disconnections. CONCLUSIONS: rs-fMRI is a feasible method for extended brain mapping. Diverse RSNs could be detected in patients with brain tumors and could be applied in preoperative planning. SCA was a robust and direct approach for data analysis and could answer specific clinically relevant questions. However, further studies are needed to validate the technique and its clinical impact.

Title: Multi-Channel 3D Deep Feature Learning for Survival Time Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients Using Multi-Modal Neuroimages.
Abstract: High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors. Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine.

Title: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Activation Optimization in the Setting of Brain Tumor-Induced Neurovascular Uncoupling Using Resting-State Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations.
Abstract: The goal of this study was to demonstrate that a novel resting state BOLD ALFF (amplitude of low frequency fluctuations)-based correction method can substantially enhance the detectability of motor task activation in the presence of tumor-induced neurovascular uncoupling (NVU). Twelve de novo brain tumor patients who underwent comprehensive clinical BOLD fMRI exams including task fMRI and resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) were evaluated. Each patient displayed decreased/absent task fMRI activation in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex in the absence of corresponding motor deficit or suboptimal task performance, consistent with NVU. Z-score maps for the motor tasks were obtained from general linear model (GLM) analysis (reflecting motor activation vs. rest). ALFF maps were calculated from rsfMRI data. Precentral and postcentral gyri in contralesional (CL) and ipsilesional (IL) hemispheres were parcellated using an Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template for each patient. A novel ALFF-based correction method was used to identify the NVU affected voxels in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (PMC), and a correction factor was applied to normalize the baseline Z-scores for these voxels. In all cases, substantially greater activation was seen on post-ALFF correction motor activation maps within the ipsilesional precentral gyri than in the pre-ALFF correction activation maps. We have demonstrated the feasibility of a new resting state ALFF-based technique for effective correction of brain tumor-related NVU in the primary motor cortex.

Title: ReStNeuMap: a tool for automatic extraction of resting-state functional MRI networks in neurosurgical practice.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) represents a promising and cost-effective alternative to task-based fMRI for presurgical mapping. However, the lack of clinically streamlined and reliable rs-fMRI analysis tools has prevented wide adoption of this technique. In this work, the authors introduce an rs-fMRI processing pipeline (ReStNeuMap) for automatic single-patient rs-fMRI network analysis. METHODS: The authors provide a description of the rs-fMRI network analysis steps implemented in ReStNeuMap and report their initial experience with this tool after performing presurgical mapping in 6 patients. They verified the spatial agreement between rs-fMRI networks derived by ReStNeuMap and localization of activation with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES). RESULTS: The authors automatically extracted rs-fMRI networks including eloquent cortex in spatial proximity with the resected lesion in all patients. The distance between DES points and corresponding rs-fMRI networks was less than 1 cm in 78% of cases for motor, 100% of cases for visual, 87.5% of cases for language, and 100% of cases for speech articulation mapping. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' initial experience with ReStNeuMap showed good spatial agreement between presurgical rs-fMRI predictions and DES findings during awake surgery. The availability of the rs-fMRI analysis tools for clinicians aiming to perform noninvasive mapping of brain functional networks may extend its application beyond surgical practice.

Title: Motor and language deficits correlate with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging networks in patients with brain tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence of pre-operative resting state functional magnetic resonance (RS-fMRI) validation by correlating it with clinical pre-operative status in brain tumor patients is scarce. Our aim was to validate the functional relevance of RS-fMRI by investigating the association between RS-fMRI and pre-operative motor and language function performance in patients with brain tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with brain tumors were prospectively recruited. Patients with tumors near precentral gyrus (n = 49) underwent assessment for apparent (paresis) and subtle (finger tapping) deficits. Patients with left frontal tumors in the vicinity of the inferior frontal gyrus (n = 29) underwent assessment for gross (aphasia) and mild language (phonological verbal fluency) deficits. RS-fMRI results were extracted by spatial independent component analysis (ICA). RESULTS: Motor group: paretic patients showed significantly (P = 0.01) decreased BOLD signal in ipsilesional precentral gyrus when compared to contralesional one. Significantly (P < 0.01) lower BOLD signal was also observed in ipsilesional precentral gyrus of paretics when compared with the non-paretics. In asymptomatic patients, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) between ipsilesional motor cortex BOLD signal and contralesional finger tapping performance was observed. Language group: patients with aphasia showed significantly (P = 0.01) decreased RS-fMRI BOLD signal in left BA 44 when compared with non- aphasics. In asymptomatic patients, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.72, P < 0.01) between BA 44 BOLD signal and phonological fluency performance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that RS-fMRI BOLD signal of motor and language networks were significantly affected by the tumors implying the usefulness of the method for assessment of the underlying functions in brain tumors patients.

Title: Predicting primary outcomes of brain tumor patients with advanced neuroimaging MRI measures.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Advanced neuroimaging measures along with clinical variables acquired during standard imaging protocols provide a rich source of information for brain tumor patient treatment and management. Machine learning analysis has had much recent success in neuroimaging applications for normal and patient populations and has potential, specifically for brain tumor patient outcome prediction. The purpose of this work was to construct, using the current patient population distribution, a high accuracy predictor for brain tumor patient outcomes of mortality and morbidity (i.e., transient and persistent language and motor deficits). The clinical value offered is a statistical tool to help guide treatment and planning as well as an investigation of the influential factors of the disease process. METHODS: Resting state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and task fMRI data in combination with clinical and demographic variables were used to represent the tumor patient population (n = 62; mean age = 51.2 yrs.) in a machine learning analysis in order to predict outcomes. RESULTS: A support vector machine classifier with a t-test filter and recursive feature elimination predicted patient mortality (18-month interval) with 80.7% accuracy, language deficits (transient) with 74.2%, motor deficits with 71.0%, language outcomes (persistent) with 80.7% and motor outcomes with 83.9%. The most influential features of the predictors were resting fMRI connectivity, and fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures in the internal capsule, brain stem and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that advanced neuroimaging data with machine learning methods can potentially predict patient outcomes and reveal influential factors driving the predictions.

Title: Overall survival time prediction for high-grade glioma patients based on large-scale brain functional networks.
Abstract: High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accurate preoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucial for treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS prediction studies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on the magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRI appearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurate individualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namely brain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networks where the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesion appearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics features could capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated with prognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation with regional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks (characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamics FC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networks for a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on a preliminary dataset (N = 34 with bad OS, mean OS, ~400 days; N = 34 with good OS, mean OS, ~1030 days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (86.8%) on separating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However, if using only conventionally derived descriptive features (e.g., age and tumor characteristics), the accuracy is low (63.2%). Our study highlights the importance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatment planning.

Title: Reorganization of cerebro-cerebellar circuit in patients with left hemispheric gliomas involving language network: A combined structural and resting-state functional MRI study.
Abstract: The role of cerebellum and cerebro-cerebellar system in neural plasticity induced by cerebral gliomas involving language network has long been ignored. Moreover, whether or not the process of reorganization is different in glioma patients with different growth kinetics remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we utilized preoperative structural and resting-state functional MRI data of 78 patients with left cerebral gliomas involving language network areas, including 46 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG, WHO grade II), 32 with high-grade glioma (HGG, WHO grade III/IV), and 44 healthy controls. Spontaneous brain activity, resting-state functional connectivity and gray matter volume alterations of the cerebellum were examined. We found that both LGG and HGG patients exhibited bidirectional alteration of brain activity in language-related cerebellar areas. Brain activity in areas with increased alteration was significantly correlated with the language and MMSE scores. Structurally, LGG patients exhibited greater gray matter volume in regions with increased brain activity, suggesting a structure-function coupled alteration in cerebellum. Furthermore, we observed that cerebellar regions with decreased brain activity exhibited increased functional connectivity with contralesional cerebro-cerebellar system in LGG patients. Together, our findings provide empirical evidence for a vital role of cerebellum and cerebro-cerebellar circuit in neural plasticity following lesional damage to cerebral language network. Moreover, we highlight the possible different reorganizational mechanisms of brain functional connectivity underlying different levels of behavioral impairments in LGG and HGG patients.

Title: Preoperative Mapping of the Supplementary Motor Area in Patients with Brain Tumor Using Resting-State fMRI with Seed-Based Analysis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The supplementary motor area can be a critical region in the preoperative planning of patients undergoing brain tumor resection because it plays a role in both language and motor function. While primary motor regions have been successfully identified using resting-state fMRI, there is variability in the literature regarding the identification of the supplementary motor area for preoperative planning. The purpose of our study was to compare resting-state fMRI to task-based fMRI for localization of the supplementary motor area in a large cohort of patients with brain tumors presenting for preoperative brain mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with brain tumors were evaluated with resting-state fMRI using seed-based analysis of hand and orofacial motor regions. Rates of supplementary motor area localization were compared with those in healthy controls and with localization results by task-based fMRI. RESULTS: Localization of the supplementary motor area using hand motor seed regions was more effective than seeding using orofacial motor regions for both patients with brain tumor (95.5% versus 34.8%, P < .001) and controls (95.2% versus 45.2%, P < .001). Bilateral hand motor seeding was superior to unilateral hand motor seeding in patients with brain tumor for either side (95.5% versus 75.8%/75.8% for right/left, P < .001). No difference was found in the ability to identify the supplementary motor area between patients with brain tumors and controls. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to task-based fMRI, seed-based analysis of resting-state fMRI represents an equally effective method for supplementary motor area localization in patients with brain tumors, with the best results obtained with bilateral hand motor region seeding.

Title: Functional magnetic resonance imaging in glioma patients: from clinical applications to future perspectives.
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows the non-invasive assessment of human brain activity in vivo. In glioma patients, fMRI is frequently used to determine the individual functional anatomy of the motor and language network in a presurgical setting to optimize surgical procedures and prevent extensive damage to functionally eloquent areas. Novel developments based on resting-state fMRI may help to improve presurgical planning for patients which are unable to perform structured tasks and might extend presurgical mapping to include additional functional networks. Recent advances indicate a promising potential for future applications of fMRI in glioma patients which might help to identify neoplastic tissue or predict the long-term functional outcome of individual patients.

Title: Tumor Tissue Detection using Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent Functional MRI based on Independent Component Analysis.
Abstract: Accurate delineation of gliomas from the surrounding normal brain areas helps maximize tumor resection and improves outcome. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) has been routinely adopted for presurgical mapping of the surrounding functional areas. For completely utilizing such imaging data, here we show the feasibility of using presurgical fMRI for tumor delineation. In particular, we introduce a novel method dedicated to tumor detection based on independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) with automatic tumor component identification. Multi-center rs-fMRI data of 32 glioma patients from three centers, plus the additional proof-of-concept data of 28 patients from the fourth center with non-brain musculoskeletal tumors, are fed into individual ICA with different total number of components (TNCs). The best-fitted tumor-related components derived from the optimized TNCs setting are automatically determined based on a new template-matching algorithm. The success rates are 100%, 100% and 93.75% for glioma tissue detection for the three centers, respectively, and 85.19% for musculoskeletal tumor detection. We propose that the high success rate could come from the previously overlooked ability of BOLD rs-fMRI in characterizing the abnormal vascularization, vasomotion and perfusion caused by tumors. Our findings suggest an additional usage of the rs-fMRI for comprehensive presurgical assessment.

Title: How much is enough-Can resting state fMRI provide a demarcation for neurosurgical resection in glioma?
Abstract: This study represents a systematic review of the insights provided by resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) use in the glioma population. Following PRISMA guidelines, 45 studies were included in the review and were classified in glioma-related neuronal changes (n=28) and eloquent area localization (n=17). Despite the heterogeneous nature of the studies, there is considerable evidence of diffuse functional reorganization occurring in the setting of gliomas with local and interhemispheric functional connectivity alterations involving different functional networks. The studies showed evidence of decreased long distance functional connectivity and increased global local efficiency occurring in the setting of gliomas. The tumour grade seems to correlate with distinct functional connectivity changes. Overall, there is a potential clinical utility of rs-fMRI for identifying the functional brain network disruptions occurring in the setting of gliomas. Further studies utilizing standardized analytical methods are required to elucidate the mechanism through which gliomas induce global changes in brain connectivity.

Title: An automated method for identifying an independent component analysis-based language-related resting-state network in brain tumor subjects for surgical planning.
Abstract: As a noninvasive and "task-free" technique, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been gradually applied to pre-surgical functional mapping. Independent component analysis (ICA)-based mapping has shown advantage, as no a priori information is required. We developed an automated method for identifying language network in brain tumor subjects using ICA on rs-fMRI. In addition to standard processing strategies, we applied a discriminability-index-based component identification algorithm to identify language networks in three different groups. The results from the training group were validated in an independent group of healthy human subjects. For the testing group, ICA and seed-based correlation were separately computed and the detected language networks were assessed by intra-operative stimulation mapping to verify reliability of application in the clinical setting. Individualized language network mapping could be automatically achieved for all subjects from the two healthy groups except one (19/20, success rate = 95.0%). In the testing group (brain tumor patients), the sensitivity of the language mapping result was 60.9%, which increased to 87.0% (superior to that of conventional seed-based correlation [47.8%]) after extending to a radius of 1 cm. We established an automatic and practical component identification method for rs-fMRI-based pre-surgical mapping and successfully applied it to brain tumor patients.

Title: Real-Time Motor Cortex Mapping for the Safe Resection of Glioma: An Intraoperative Resting-State fMRI Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state functional MR imaging has been used for motor mapping in presurgical planning but never used intraoperatively. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of applying intraoperative resting-state functional MR imaging for the safe resection of gliomas using real-time motor cortex mapping during an operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using interventional MR imaging, we conducted preoperative and intraoperative resting-state intrinsic functional connectivity analyses of the motor cortex in 30 patients with brain tumors. Factors that may influence intraoperative imaging quality, including anesthesia type (general or awake anesthesia) and tumor cavity (filled with normal saline or not), were studied to investigate image quality. Additionally, direct cortical stimulation was used to validate the accuracy of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in mapping the motor cortex. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative resting-state fMRI scans were acquired for all patients. Fourteen patients who successfully completed both sufficient intraoperative resting-state fMRI and direct cortical stimulation were used for further analysis of sensitivity and specificity. Compared with those subjected to direct cortical stimulation, the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in localizing the motor area were 61.7% and 93.7%, respectively. The image quality of intraoperative resting-state fMRI was better when the tumor cavity was filled with normal saline (P = .049). However, no significant difference between the anesthesia types was observed (P = .102). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using intraoperative resting-state fMRI for real-time localization of functional areas during a neurologic operation. The findings suggest that using intraoperative resting-state fMRI can avoid the risk of intraoperative seizures due to direct cortical stimulation and may provide neurosurgeons with valuable information to facilitate the safe resection of gliomas.

Title: A network-level approach of cognitive flexibility impairment after surgery of a right temporo-parietal glioma.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The right "non-dominant" temporo-parietal junction is usually not considered as a highly eloquent area. This contrasts with its mirrored left "dominant" counterpart, which is known as highly eloquent regarding language function. The question arises about which functions should be monitored when operating lesions of the right temporo-parietal junction under awake conditions. METHODS: We report the case of a patient who underwent a surgical resection of a glioma located in the right temporo-parietal junction. Cognitive evaluations were performed preoperatively and 4 months after surgery, as well as resting state fMRI and diffusion-based tractography. RESULTS: Long-term postoperative cognitive examination revealed an important deterioration of cognitive control abilities, especially regarding set-shifting abilities as measured by Trail making test part B. Based on pre- and postoperative resting state fMRI and diffusion-based tractography, we demonstrate that surgical resection massively impacted structural and functional connectivity of the right fronto-parieto-temporal network, a network that is classically involved in cognitive control, reasoning and working memory. CONCLUSION: This case clearly illustrates how a white matter focal lesion can generate a neuropsychological deficit by remotely disconnecting distant cortical areas belonging to a functional network. Furthermore, our observation strongly supports the use of intraoperative cognitive control tests during surgery of the right temporo-parietal junction and promote the interest of pre and postoperative resting state functional connectivity to explore the potential mechanisms causing cognitive deficits.

Title: Functional MRI for Surgery of Gliomas.
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MR tractography have been increasingly used at every stage of the surgical management of brain gliomas, as a means to improve tumor resection while preserving brain functions. This review provides an overview of the last advancements in the field of functional MRI techniques, with a particular focus on their current clinical use and reliability in the preoperative and intraoperative setting, as well as their future perspectives for personalized multimodal management of patients with gliomas. RECENT FINDINGS: fMRI and diffusion MR tractography give relevant insights on the anatomo-functional organization of eloquent cortical areas and subcortical connections near or inside a tumor. Task-based fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography have proven to be valid and highly sensitive tools for localizing the distinct eloquent cortical and subcortical areas before surgery in glioma patients; they also show good accuracy when compared with intraoperative stimulation mapping data. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity as well as new advanced HARDI (high angular resolution diffusion imaging) tractography methods are improving and reshaping the role of functional MRI for surgery of gliomas, with potential benefit for personalized treatment strategies. Noninvasive functional MRI techniques may offer the opportunity to perform a multimodal assessment in brain tumors, to be integrated with intraoperative mapping and clinical data for improving surgical management and oncological and functional outcome in patients affected by gliomas.

Title: Value of Frequency Domain Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Metrics Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation and Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation in the Assessment of Brain Tumor-Induced Neurovascular Uncoupling.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore whether the phenomenon of brain tumor-related neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) in resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) (rsfMRI) may also affect the resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) frequency domain metrics the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF). Twelve de novo brain tumor patients, who underwent clinical fMRI examinations, including task-based fMRI (tbfMRI) and rsfMRI, were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved study. Each patient displayed decreased/absent tbfMRI activation in the primary ipsilesional (IL) sensorimotor cortex in the absence of a corresponding motor deficit or suboptimal task performance, consistent with NVU. Z-score maps for the motor tasks were obtained from general linear model analysis (reflecting motor activation vs. rest). Seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) maps of sensorimotor network, ALFF, and fALFF were calculated from rsfMRI data. Precentral and postcentral gyri in contralesional (CL) and IL hemispheres were parcellated using an automated anatomical labeling template for each patient. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on four maps: tbfMRI, SCA, ALFF, and fALFF. Voxel values in the CL and IL ROIs of each map were divided by the corresponding global mean of ALFF and fALFF in the cortical brain tissue. Group analysis revealed significantly decreased IL ALFF (p = 0.02) and fALFF (p = 0.03) metrics compared with CL ROIs, consistent with similar findings of significantly decreased IL BOLD signal for tbfMRI (p = 0.0005) and SCA maps (p = 0.0004). The frequency domain metrics ALFF and fALFF may be markers of lesion-induced NVU in rsfMRI similar to previously reported alterations in tbfMRI activation and SCA-derived resting-state functional connectivity maps.

Title: Outcome Prediction for Patient with High-Grade Gliomas from Brain Functional and Structural Networks.
Abstract: High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer, which is characterized by very poor prognosis. To help optimize treatment strategy, accurate preoperative prediction of HGG patient's outcome (i.e., survival time) is of great clinical value. However, there are huge individual variability of HGG, which produces a large variation in survival time, thus making prognostic prediction more challenging. Previous brain imaging-based outcome prediction studies relied only on the imaging intensity inside or slightly around the tumor, while ignoring any information that is located far away from the lesion (i.e., the "normal appearing" brain tissue). Notably, in addition to altering MR image intensity, we hypothesize that the HGG growth and its mass effect also change both structural (can be modeled by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) and functional brain connectivities (estimated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)). Therefore, integrating connectomics information in outcome prediction could improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we unprecedentedly devise a machine learning-based HGG prediction framework that can effectively extract valuable features from complex human brain connectome using network analysis tools, followed by a novel multi-stage feature selection strategy to single out good features while reducing feature redundancy. Ultimately, we use support vector machine (SVM) to classify HGG outcome as either bad (survival time </= 650 days) or good (survival time >650 days). Our method achieved 75 % prediction accuracy. We also found that functional and structural networks provide complementary information for the outcome prediction, thus leading to increased prediction accuracy compared with the baseline method, which only uses the basic clinical information (63.2 %).

Title: Presurgical Brain Mapping of the Ventral Somatomotor Network in Patients with Brain Tumors Using Resting-State fMRI.
Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resting-state fMRI readily identifies the dorsal but less consistently the ventral somatomotor network. Our aim was to assess the relative utility of resting-state fMRI in the identification of the ventral somatomotor network via comparison with task-based fMRI in patients with brain tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 26 surgically naive patients referred for presurgical fMRI brain mapping who had undergone both satisfactory ventral motor activation tasks and resting-state fMRI. Following standard preprocessing for task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI, general linear model analysis of the ventral motor tasks and independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI were performed with the number of components set to 20, 30, 40, and 50. Visual overlap of task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI at different component levels was assessed and categorized as full match, partial match, or no match. Rest-versus-task-fMRI concordance was calculated with Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal. Multithresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface was calculated. RESULTS: The ventral somatomotor network was identified in 81% of patients. At the subject level, better matches between resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI were seen with an increasing order of components (53% of cases for 20 components versus 73% for 50 components). Noise-removed group-mean volume under the surface improved as component numbers increased from 20 to 50, though ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant difference among the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, the ventral somatomotor network can be identified with an increase in the probability of a better match at a higher component number. There is variable concordance of the ventral somatomotor network at the single-subject level between resting-state and task-based fMRI.

Title: The Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Regional Homogeneity Metrics-Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance-Regional Homogeneity and Coherence-Regional Homogeneity-Are Valid Indicators of Tumor-Related Neurovascular Uncoupling.
Abstract: The aim of this study is to determine whether regional homogeneity (ReHo) of resting-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data based on Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC-ReHo) and coherence (Cohe-ReHo) metrics may allow detection of brain tumor-induced neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) in the sensorimotor network similar to findings in standard motor task-based BOLD fMRI (tbfMRI) activation. Twelve de novo brain tumor patients undergoing clinical fMRI exams (tbfMRI and rsfMRI) were included in this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study. Each patient displayed decreased/absent tbfMRI activation in the primary ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in the absence of corresponding motor deficit or suboptimal task performance, consistent with NVU. Z-score maps for motor tasks were obtained from the general linear model (GLM) analysis (reflecting motor activation vs. rest). KCC-ReHo and Cohe-ReHo maps were calculated from rsfMRI data. Precentral and postcentral gyri in contralesional (CL) and ipsilesional (IL) hemispheres were parcellated using an automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template for each patient. Similar region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on tbfMRI, KCC-ReHo, and Cohe-ReHo maps to allow direct comparison of results. Voxel values in CL and IL ROIs of each map were divided by the corresponding global mean of KCC-ReHo and Cohe-ReHo in bihemispheric cortical brain tissue. Group analysis revealed significantly decreased IL mean KCC-ReHo (p = 0.02) and Cohe-ReHo (p = 0.04) metrics compared with respective values in the CL ROIs, consistent with similar findings of significantly decreased ipsilesional BOLD signal for tbfMRI (p = 0.0005). Ipsilesional abnormalities in ReHo derived from rsfMRI may serve as potential indicators of NVU in patients with brain tumors and other resectable brain lesions; as such, ReHo findings may complement findings on tbfMRI used for presurgical planning.

Title: On the detection of high frequency correlations in resting state fMRI.
Abstract: Current studies of resting-state connectivity rely on coherent signal fluctuations at frequencies below 0.1 Hz, however, recent studies using high-speed fMRI have shown that fluctuations above 0.5 Hz may exist. This study replicates the feasibility of measuring high frequency (HF) correlations in six healthy controls and a patient with a brain tumor while analyzing non-physiological signal sources via simulation. Resting-state data were acquired using a high-speed multi-slab echo-volumar imaging pulse sequence with 136 ms temporal resolution. Bandpass frequency filtering in combination with sliding window seed-based connectivity analysis using running mean of the correlation maps was employed to map HF correlations up to 3.7 Hz. Computer simulations of Rician noise and the underlying point spread function were analyzed to estimate baseline spatial autocorrelation levels in four major networks (auditory, sensorimotor, visual, and default-mode). Using seed regions based on Brodmann areas, the auditory and default-mode networks were observed to have significant frequency band dependent HF correlations above baseline spatial autocorrelation levels. Correlations in the sensorimotor network were at trend level. The auditory network was still observed using a unilateral single voxel seed. In the patient, HF auditory correlations showed a spatial displacement near the tumor consistent with the displacement seen at low frequencies. In conclusion, our data suggest that HF connectivity in the human brain may be observable with high-speed fMRI, however, the detection sensitivity may depend on the network observed, data acquisition technique, and analysis method.

Title: Functional connectivity networks for preoperative brain mapping in neurosurgery.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Resection of focal brain lesions involves maximizing the resection while preserving brain function. Mapping brain function has entered a new era focusing on distributed connectivity networks at "rest," that is, in the absence of a specific task or stimulus, requiring minimal participant engagement. Central to this frame shift has been the development of methods for the rapid assessment of whole-brain connectivity with functional MRI (fMRI) involving blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging. The authors appraised the feasibility of fMRI-based mapping of a repertoire of functional connectivity networks in neurosurgical patients with focal lesions and the potential benefits of resting-state connectivity mapping for surgical planning. METHODS Resting-state fMRI sequences with a 3-T scanner and multiecho echo-planar imaging coupled to independent component analysis were acquired preoperatively from 5 study participants who had a right temporoparietooccipital glioblastoma. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed with InstaCorr. Network identification focused on 7 major functional connectivity networks described in the literature and a putative language network centered on Broca's area. RESULTS All 8 functional connectivity networks were identified in each participant. Tumor-related topological changes to the default mode network were observed in all participants. In addition, each participant had at least 1 other abnormal network, and each network was abnormal in at least 1 participant. Individual patterns of network irregularities were identified with a qualitative approach and included local displacement due to mass effect, loss of a functional network component, and recruitment of new regions. CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI can reliably and rapidly detect common functional connectivity networks in patients with glioblastoma and also has sufficient sensitivity for identifying patterns of network alterations. Mapping of functional connectivity networks offers the possibility to expand investigations to less commonly explored neuropsychological processes, such as executive control, attention, and salience. Changes in these networks may allow insights into mechanisms underlying the functional consequences of tumor growth, surgical intervention, and patient rehabilitation.

Title: Transient effects of tumor location on the functional architecture at rest in glioblastoma patients: three longitudinal case studies.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The cognitive function of brain tumor patients is affected during the treatment. There is evidence that gliomas and surgery alter the functional brain connectivity but studies on the longitudinal effects are lacking. METHODS: We acquired longitudinal (pre- and post-radiotherapy) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on three selected glioblastoma patients. These cases were selected to study three models: a lesion involving a functional hub within a central system, a lesion involving a peripheral node within a central system and a lesion involving a peripheral node of a non-central system. RESULTS: We found that, as expected, the tumor lesion affects connections in close vicinity, but when the lesion relates to a functional hub, these changes involve long-range connections leading to diverse connectivity profiles pre- and post-radiotherapy. In particular, a global but temporary improvement in the post-radiotherapy connectivity was obtained when treating a lesion close to a network hub, such as the posterior Cingulate Cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that this node re-establishes communication to nodes further away in the network. Eventually, these observed effects seem to be transient and on the long-term the tumor burden leads to an overall decline of connectivity following the course of the pathology. Furthermore, we obtained that the link between hubs, such as the Supplementary Motor Area and posterior Cingulate Cortex represents an important backbone by means of which within and across network communication is handled: the disruption of this connection seems to imply a strong decrease in the overall connectivity.

Title: Recovery of functional connectivity of the sensorimotor network after surgery for diffuse low-grade gliomas involving the supplementary motor area.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE The supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is a well-studied lesional model of brain plasticity involving the sensorimotor network. Patients with diffuse low-grade gliomas in the SMA may exhibit this syndrome after resective surgery. They experience a temporary loss of motor function, which completely resolves within 3 months. The authors used functional MRI (fMRI) resting state analysis of the sensorimotor network to investigate large-scale brain plasticity between the immediate postoperative period and 3 months' follow-up. METHODS Resting state fMRI was performed preoperatively, during the immediate postoperative period, and 3 months postoperatively in 6 patients with diffuse low-grade gliomas who underwent partial surgical excision of the SMA. Correlation analysis within the sensorimotor network was carried out on those 3 time points to study modifications of its functional connectivity. RESULTS The results showed a large-scale reorganization of the sensorimotor network. Interhemispheric connectivity was decreased in the postoperative period, and increased again during the recovery process. Connectivity between the lesion side motor area and the contralateral SMA rose to higher values than in the preoperative period. Intrahemispheric connectivity was decreased during the immediate postoperative period and had returned to preoperative values at 3 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm the findings reported in the existing literature on the plasticity of the SMA, showing large-scale modifications of the sensorimotor network, at both inter- and intrahemispheric levels. They suggest that interhemispheric connectivity might be a correlate of SMA syndrome recovery.

Title: Increased frontal functional networks in adult survivors of childhood brain tumors.
Abstract: Childhood brain tumors and associated treatment have been shown to affect brain development and cognitive outcomes. Understanding the functional connectivity of brain many years after diagnosis and treatment may inform the development of interventions to improve the long-term outcomes of adult survivors of childhood brain tumors. This work investigated the frontal region functional connectivity of 16 adult survivors of childhood cerebellar tumors after an average of 14.9 years from diagnosis and 16 demographically-matched controls using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify the resting state activity from rs-fMRI data and to select the specific regions associated with executive functions, followed by the secondary analysis of the functional networks connecting these regions. It was found that survivors exhibited differences in the functional connectivity in executive control network (ECN), default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) compared to demographically-matched controls. More specifically, the number of functional connectivity observed in the survivors is higher than that in the controls, and with increased strength, or stronger correlation coefficient between paired seeds, in survivors compared to the controls. Observed hyperconnectivity in the selected frontal functional network thus is consistent with findings in patients with other neurological injuries and diseases.

Title: Alteration of the Intra- and Cross- Hemisphere Posterior Default Mode Network in Frontal Lobe Glioma Patients.
Abstract: Patients with frontal lobe gliomas often experience neurocognitive dysfunctions before surgery, which affects the default mode network (DMN) to different degrees. This study quantitatively analyzed this effect from the perspective of cerebral hemispheric functional connectivity (FC). We collected resting-state fMRI data from 20 frontal lobe glioma patients before treatment and 20 healthy controls. All of the patients and controls were right-handed. After pre-processing the images, FC maps were built from the seed defined in the left or right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to the target regions determined in the left or right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), respectively. The intra- and cross-group statistical calculations of FC strength were compared. The conclusions were as follows: (1) the intra-hemisphere FC strength values between the PCC and TPJ on the left and right were decreased in patients compared with controls; and (2) the correlation coefficients between the FC pairs in the patients were increased compared with the corresponding controls. When all of the patients were grouped by their tumor's hemispheric location, (3) the FC of the subgroups showed that the dominant hemisphere was vulnerable to glioma, and (4) the FC in the dominant hemisphere showed a significant correlation with WHO grade.

Title: Comparison between resting state fMRI networks and responsive cortical stimulations in glioma patients.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To validate the functional relevance of resting state networks (RSNs) by means of a comparison of resting state connectivity (RSC) between language regions elicited by direct cortical stimulation versus RSC between random regions; and to evaluate the accuracy of resting state fMRI in surgical planning by assessing the overlap between RSNs and intraoperative functional mapping results. METHODS: Sensorimotor and language eloquent sites were identified by direct electrical cortical stimulation in 98 patients with a diffuse low-grade glioma. A seed to voxel analysis with inter-language stimulation point connectivity versus inter-random ROIs connectivity was performed (19 patients). An independant component analysis (ICA) was also applied to rsfMRI data. Language and sensorimotor components were selected over 20 independent components and compared to the corresponding stimulation points and resected cortex masks (31 and 90 patients, respectively). RESULTS: Mean connectivity value between language seeds was significantly higher than the one between random seeds (0.68 +/- 0.39 and 0.12 +/- 0.21 respectively, P < 10(-10) ). 96 +/- 11% of sensorimotor stimulation points were located within 10 mm from sensorimotor ICA maps versus 92 +/- 21% for language. 3.1 and 15% of resected cortex overlapped sensorimotor and language networks, respectively. Mean sensorimotor stimulation points and resected cortex z-scores were 2.0 +/- 1.2 and -0.050 +/- 0.60, respectively (P < 10(-10) ). Mean language stimulation points and resected cortex z-scores were 1.6 +/- 1.9 and 0.68 +/- 0.91, respectively, P < 0.005. CONCLUSION: The significantly higher RSC between language seeds than between random seeds validated the functional relevance of RSC. ICA partly succeeded to distinguish eloquent versus surgically removable areas and may be possibly used as a complementary tool to intraoperative mapping. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3721-3732, 2016.

Title: PreSurgMapp: a MATLAB Toolbox for Presurgical Mapping of Eloquent Functional Areas Based on Task-Related and Resting-State Functional MRI.
Abstract: The main goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize tumor resection while minimizing the risk of irreversible postoperative functional sequelae. Eloquent functional areas should be delineated preoperatively, particularly for patients with tumors near eloquent areas. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive technique that demonstrates great promise for presurgical planning. However, specialized data processing toolkits for presurgical planning remain lacking. Based on several functions in open-source software such as Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST), Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) and Multiple Independent Component Analysis (MICA), here, we introduce an open-source MATLAB toolbox named PreSurgMapp. This toolbox can reveal eloquent areas using comprehensive methods and various complementary fMRI modalities. For example, PreSurgMapp supports both model-based (general linear model, GLM, and seed correlation) and data-driven (independent component analysis, ICA) methods and processes both task-based and resting-state fMRI data. PreSurgMapp is designed for highly automatic and individualized functional mapping with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for time-saving pipeline processing. For example, sensorimotor and language-related components can be automatically identified without human input interference using an effective, accurate component identification algorithm using discriminability index. All the results generated can be further evaluated and compared by neuro-radiologists or neurosurgeons. This software has substantial value for clinical neuro-radiology and neuro-oncology, including application to patients with low- and high-grade brain tumors and those with epilepsy foci in the dominant language hemisphere who are planning to undergo a temporal lobectomy.

Title: Exploratory study of the effect of brain tumors on the default mode network.
Abstract: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is a popular method of visualizing functional networks in the brain. One of these networks, the default mode network (DMN), has exhibited altered connectivity in a variety of pathological states, including brain tumors. However, very few studies have attempted to link the effect of tumor localization, type and size on DMN connectivity. We collected RS-fMRI data in 73 patients with various brain tumors and attempted to characterize the different effects these tumors had on DMN connectivity based on their location, type and size. This was done by comparing the tumor patients with healthy controls using independent component analysis (ICA) and seed based analysis. We also used a multi-seed approach described in the paper to account for anatomy distortion in the tumor patients. We found that tumors in the left hemisphere had the largest effect on DMN connectivity regardless of their size and type, while this effect was not observed for right hemispheric tumors. Tumors in the cerebellum also had statistically significant effects on DMN connectivity. These results suggest that DMN connectivity in the left side of the brain may be more fragile to insults by lesions.

Title: Quantitative comparisons on hand motor functional areas determined by resting state and task BOLD fMRI and anatomical MRI for pre-surgical planning of patients with brain tumors.
Abstract: For pre-surgical planning we present quantitative comparison of the location of the hand motor functional area determined by right hand finger tapping BOLD fMRI, resting state BOLD fMRI, and anatomically using high resolution T1 weighted images. Data were obtained on 10 healthy subjects and 25 patients with left sided brain tumors. Our results show that there are important differences in the locations (i.e., > 20 mm) of the determined hand motor voxels by these three MR imaging methods. This can have significant effect on the pre-surgical planning of these patients depending on the modality used. In 13 of the 25 cases (i.e., 52%) the distances between the task-determined and the rs-fMRI determined hand areas were more than 20 mm; in 13 of 25 cases (i.e., 52%) the distances between the task-determined and anatomically determined hand areas were > 20 mm; and in 16 of 25 cases (i.e., 64%) the distances between the rs-fMRI determined and anatomically determined hand areas were more than 20 mm. In just three cases, the distances determined by all three modalities were within 20 mm of each other. The differences in the location or fingerprint of the hand motor areas, as determined by these three MR methods result from the different underlying mechanisms of these three modalities and possibly the effects of tumors on these modalities.

Title: Use of Network Analysis to Establish Neurosurgical Parameters in Gliomas and Epilepsy.
Abstract: Cutting-edge neuroimaging technologies can facilitate preoperative evaluation in various neurosurgical settings. Surgery for gliomas and epilepsy requires precise localization for resection due to the need to preserve (or perhaps improve) higher cognitive functions. Accordingly, a hodological approach should be taken that considers subcortical networks as well as cortical functions within various functional domains. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to provide new insights that are valuable for this approach. In this review, we describe recent developments in network analysis using resting state fMRI related to factors in glioma and epilepsy surgery: the identification of functionally dominant areas, evaluation of cognitive function by alteration of resting state networks (RSNs), glioma grading, and epileptic focus detection. One particular challenge that is close to realization is using fMRI for the identification of sensorimotor- and language-dominant areas during a task-free resting state. Various RSNs representative of the default mode network demonstrated at least some alterations in both patient groups, which correlated with behavioral changes including cognition, memory, and attention, and the development of psychosis. Still challenging is the detection of epileptic foci and propagation pathways when using only network analysis with resting state fMRI; however, a combined method with simultaneous electroencephalography has produced promising results. Consequently, network analysis is expected to continue to advance as neuroimaging technology improves in the next decade, and preoperative evaluation for neurosurgical parameters through these techniques should improve parallel with them.

Title: Demonstration of Brain Tumor-Induced Neurovascular Uncoupling in Resting-State fMRI at Ultrahigh Field.
Abstract: To demonstrate in a small case series for the first time the phenomenon of brain tumor-related neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) in resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultrahigh field (7T). Two de novo (i.e., untreated) brain tumor patients underwent both BOLD resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) on a 7T MRI system and motor task-based BOLD fMRI at 3T. Ipsilesional (i.e., ipsilateral to tumor or IL) and contralesional (i.e., contralateral to tumor or CL) region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on both 3T motor task-related general linear model-derived activation maps and on 7T rsfMRI independent component analysis (ICA)-derived sensorimotor network maps for each case. Asymmetry scores (ASs) were computed based on numbers of suprathreshold voxels in the IL and CL ROIs. In each patient, ASs derived from ROI analysis of suprathreshold voxels in IL and CL ROIs in task-related activation maps and rsfMRI ICA-derived sensorimotor component maps indicate greater number of suprathreshold voxels in contralesional than ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in both maps. In patient 1, an AS of 0.2 was obtained from the suprathreshold Z-score spectrum (voxels with Z-scores >5.0) of the task-based activation map and AS of 1.0 was obtained from the suprathreshold Z-score spectrum (Z-scores >5.0) of the ICA-derived sensorimotor component map. Similarly, in patient 2, an AS of 1.0 was obtained from the suprathreshold Z-score spectrum (Z-scores >5.0) of the task-based activation map and an AS of 1.0 was obtained from the suprathreshold Z-score spectrum (Z-scores >5.0) of the ICA-derived sensorimotor component map. Overall, decreased BOLD signal was noted in IL compared with CL ROIs on both task-based activation maps and ultrahigh field resting-state maps, indicating the presence of NVU. We have demonstrated evidence of NVU on ultrahigh field 7T rsfMRI comparable with the findings on standard 3T motor task-based fMRI in both cases.

Title: Presurgical Mapping of the Language Network Using Resting-state Functional Connectivity.
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI) is a tool for investigating the functional networks that arise during the resting state of the brain. Recent advances of the resting-state fMRI analysis suggest its feasibility for evaluating language function. The most common clinical application is for presurgical mapping of cortex for a brain tumor or for resective epilespy surgery. In this article, we review the techniques and presurgical applications of resting-state fMRI analysis for language evaluation, and discuss the use in the clinical setting, focusing on planning for neurosurgery.

Title: Clinical Resting-state fMRI in the Preoperative Setting: Are We Ready for Prime Time?
Abstract: The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an introduction to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and to review the current application of this new and powerful technique in the preoperative setting using our institute's extensive experience. RS-fMRI has provided important insights into brain physiology and is an increasingly important tool in the clinical setting. As opposed to task-based functional MRI wherein the subject performs a task while being scanned, RS-fMRI evaluates low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal while the subject is at rest. Multiple resting state networks (RSNs) have been identified, including the somatosensory, language, and visual networks, which are of primary importance for presurgical planning. Over the past 4 years, we have performed over 300 RS-fMRI examinations in the clinical setting and these have been used to localize eloquent somatosensory and language cortices before brain tumor resection. RS-fMRI is particularly useful in this setting for patients who are unable to cooperate with the task-based paradigm, such as young children or those who are sedated, paretic, or aphasic.Although RS-fMRI is still investigational, our experience indicates that this method is ready for clinical application in the presurgical setting.

Title: Resting-State Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent Functional MRI: A Paradigm Shift in Preoperative Brain Mapping.
Abstract: Currently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) facilitates a preoperative awareness of an association of an eloquent region with a tumor. This information gives the neurosurgeon helpful information that can aid in creating a surgical strategy. Typically, task-based fMRI has been employed to preoperatively localize speech and motor function. Task-based fMRI depends on the patient's ability to comply with the task paradigm, which often is impaired in the setting of a brain tumor. This problem is overcome by using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to localize function. rs-fMRI measures spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, representing the brain's functional organization. In a neurosurgical context, it allows noninvasive simultaneous assessment of multiple large-scale distributed networks. Compared with task-related fMRI, rs-fMRI provides more comprehensive information on the functional architecture of the brain and is applicable in settings where task-related fMRI may provide inadequate information or could not be performed. Taken together, rs-fMRI substantially expands the preoperative mapping capability in efficiency, effectiveness, and scope. In this article, a brief introduction into rs-fMRI processing methods is followed by a detailed discussion on the role rs-fMRI plays in presurgical planning.

Title: Presurgical brain mapping of the language network in patients with brain tumors using resting-state fMRI: Comparison with task fMRI.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare language networks derived from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) with task-fMRI in patients with brain tumors and investigate variables that affect rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent component analysis (ICA) of rs-fMRI was performed with 20, 30, 40, and 50 target components (ICA20 to ICA50) and language networks identified for patients presenting for presurgical fMRI mapping between 1/1/2009 and 7/1/2015. 49 patients were analyzed fulfilling criteria for presence of brain tumors, no prior brain surgery, and adequate task-fMRI performance. Rs-vs-task-fMRI concordance was measured using Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal. Multi-thresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface (DiceVUS) and maximum Dice coefficient (MaxDice) were calculated. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance of DiceVUS and MaxDice between the four ICA order groups. Age, Sex, Handedness, Tumor Side, Tumor Size, WHO Grade, number of scrubbed volumes, image intensity root mean square (iRMS), and mean framewise displacement (FD) were used as predictors for VUS in a linear regression. RESULTS: Artificial elevation of rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance is seen at low thresholds due to noise. Noise-removed group-mean DiceVUS and MaxDice improved as ICA order increased, however ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the four groups. Linear regression demonstrated an association between iRMS and DiceVUS for ICA30-50, and iRMS and MaxDice for ICA50. CONCLUSION: Overall there is moderate group level rs-vs-task fMRI language network concordance, however substantial subject-level variability exists; iRMS may be used to determine reliability of rs-fMRI derived language networks.

Title: Evidence of Resting-state Activity in Propofol-anesthetized Patients with Intracranial Tumors.
Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Resting-state (RS) networks, revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy volunteers, have never been evaluated in anesthetized patients with brain tumors. Our purpose was to examine the presence of residual brain activity on the auditory network during propofol-induced loss of consciousness in patients with brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects with intracranial masses were prospectively studied by means of intraoperative RS-fMRI acquisitions before any craniectomy. After performing single-subject independent component analysis, spatial maps and time courses were assigned to an auditory RS network template from the literature and compared via spatial regression coefficients. RESULTS: All fMRI data were of sufficient quality for further postprocessing. In all but two patients, the RS functional activity of the auditory network could be successfully mapped. In almost all patients, contralateral activation of the auditory network was present. No significant difference was found between the mean distance of the RS activity clusters and the lesion periphery for tumors located in the temporal gyri vs. those in other brain regions. The spatial deviation between the activated cluster in our experiment and the template was significantly (P = 0.04) higher in patients with tumors located in the temporal gyri than in patients with tumors located in other regions. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol-induced anesthesia in patients with intracranial lesions does not alter the blood-oxygenation level-depended signal, and independent component analysis of intraoperative RS-fMRI may allow assessment of the auditory network in a clinical setting.

Title: Longitudinal Changes in Cerebellar and Thalamic Spontaneous Neuronal Activity After Wide-Awake Surgery of Brain Tumors: a Resting-State fMRI Study.
Abstract: Hypometabolism has been observed in the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere after various supratentorial cortical lesions. It is unknown whether the consequences of the dee- and deafferentation subsequent to wide-awake surgery for brain diffuse low-grade glioma can be assessed within remote and unresected subcortical structures such as the cerebellum or thalamus. To answer this question, we have conducted several regional analyses. More specifically, we have performed amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (neuronal activity magnitude) and regional homogeneity (local temporal correlations) analyses on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data and at different time points, before and after surgery. Our main results demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate subtle subcortical changes using these tools dedicated to the analysis of rs-fMRI data. The observed variations of spontaneous neuronal activity were particularly significant within the cerebellum which showed altered regional homogeneity and neuronal activity intensity in very different, specialized and non-overlapping subregions, in accordance to its neuro-anatomo-functional topography. These variations were moreover observed in the immediate postoperative period and recovered after 3 months.

Title: Neurovascular uncoupling in resting state fMRI demonstrated in patients with primary brain gliomas.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: To demonstrate that the problem of brain tumor-related neurovascular uncoupling (NVU) is a significant issue with respect to resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (rsfMRI) similar to task-based BOLD fMRI, in which signal detectability can be compromised by breakdown of normal neurovascular coupling. METHODS: We evaluated seven de novo brain tumor patients who underwent resting state fMRI as part of comprehensive clinical fMRI exams at 3 Tesla. For each of the seven patients who demonstrated evidence of NVU on task-based motor fMRI, we performed both an independent component analysis (ICA) and an atlas-based parcellation-based seed correlation analysis (SCA) of the resting state fMRI data. For each patient, ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) regions of interest (ROIs) comprising primary motor and somatosensory cortices were used to evaluate BOLD signal changes on Z score maps derived from both ICA and SCA analysis for evidence of NVU. A subsequent two-tailed t-test was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences between the two sides were present that were consistent with NVU. RESULTS: In seven patients, overall decreased BOLD signal (based on suprathreshold voxels in ICA and SCA-derived Z-score maps) was noted in IL compared with CL ROIs (P < 0.01), consistent with NVU. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that NVU can result in false negative BOLD signal changes on rsfMRI comparable to previously published findings on standard motor task-based fMRI.

Title: Resting state fMRI feature-based cerebral glioma grading by support vector machine.
Abstract: PURPOSE : Tumor grading plays an essential role in the optimal selection of solid tumor treatment. Noninvasive methods are needed for clinical grading of tumors. This study aimed to extract parameters of resting state blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in the region of glioma and use the extracted features for tumor grading. METHODS : Tumor segmentation was performed with both conventional MRI and RS-fMRI. Four typical parameters, signal intensity difference ratio, signal intensity correlation (SIC), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), were defined to analyze tumor regions. Mann-Whitney [Formula: see text] test was employed to identify statistical difference of these four parameters between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG), respectively. Support vector machine (SVM) was employed to assess the diagnostic contributions of these parameters. RESULTS : Compared with LGG, HGG had more complex anatomical morphology and BOLD-fMRI features in the tumor region. SIC [Formula: see text], fALFF ([Formula: see text]) and ReHo ([Formula: see text]) were selected as features for classification according to the test [Formula: see text] value. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of SVM classification were better than 80, where SIC had the best classification accuracy (89). CONCLUSION : Parameters of RS-fMRI are effective to classify the tumor grade in glioma cases. The results indicate that this technique has clinical potential to serve as a complementary diagnostic tool.

Title: Disturbed small-world networks and neurocognitive function in frontal lobe low-grade glioma patients.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Brain tumor patients often associated with losses of the small-world configuration and neurocognitive functions before operations. However, few studies were performed on the impairments of frontal lobe low-grade gliomas (LGG) after tumor resection using small-world network features. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To detect differences in the whole brain topology among LGG patients before and after operation, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI data was performed. We collected resting-state fMRI data of 12 carefully selected frontal lobe LGG patients before and after operation. We calculated the topological properties of brain functional networks in the 12 LGG, and compared with 12 healthy controls (HCs). We also applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a subset of patients (n = 12, including before and after operation groups) and HCs (n = 12). The resulting functional connectivity matrices were constructed for all 12 patients, and binary network analysis was performed. In the range of 0.05 </= Kcos t </= 0.35, the functional networks in preoperative LGG and postoperative one both fitted the definition of small-worldness. We proposed Knet = 0.20 as small-world network interval, and the results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in the two LGG groups, meanwhile the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased. Lnet in the two LGG groups both were longer than HCs. Cnet in the LGG groups were smaller than HCs. Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbed small-worldness preperty in the two LGG groups was found and widely spread in the strength and spatial organization of brain networks, and the alterated small-world network may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction in frontal lobe LGG patients.

Title: Altered functional connectivity of the default mode network in diffuse gliomas measured with pseudo-resting state fMRI.
Abstract: The purpose of the current study was to explore whether brain tumors disrupt the integrity of the default mode network (DMN), a well-characterized resting-state fMRI network. We evaluated whether tumor grade, volume, post-surgical/clinical status, or location decreased the functional connectivity within the DMN in patients with gliomas. Task-based fMRI data was obtained from 68 diffuse glioma patients and 12 healthy volunteers. Pseudo-resting state fMRI data was calculated from task-based fMRI data using standard techniques. Data was preprocessed and DMN integrity was compared across WHO grade, tumor volume surgical status (new vs. recurrent tumors), age, and KPS using univariate and multivariate linear models. WHO grade was the most significant predictor of DMN integrity (P = 0.004), whereas T2 hyperintense lesion volume was not a predictor (P = 0.154). DMN integrity was lower in high-grade (WHO III-IV) compared with low-grade (WHO II) patients (P = 0.020). Tumors in the left parietal lobe showed a more impaired DMN compared with tumors in the frontal lobe, while tumors within and outside the network nodes did not differ significantly. Results suggest higher tumor grade along with prior surgery and/or treatment cause the largest reduction in DMN functional connectivity in patients with primary gliomas, and that tumor location has an impact on connectivity.

Title: Direct, intraoperative observation of ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in awake human cortex: implications for fMRI.
Abstract: An almost sinusoidal, large amplitude ~0.1 Hz oscillation in cortical hemodynamics has been repeatedly observed in species ranging from mice to humans. However, the occurrence of 'slow sinusoidal hemodynamic oscillations' (SSHOs) in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies is rarely noted or considered. As a result, little investigation into the cause of SSHOs has been undertaken, and their potential to confound fMRI analysis, as well as their possible value as a functional biomarker has been largely overlooked. Here, we report direct observation of large-amplitude, sinusoidal ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in the cortex of an awake human undergoing surgical resection of a brain tumor. Intraoperative multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) revealed that SSHOs were spatially localized to distinct regions of the cortex, exhibited wave-like propagation, and involved oscillations in the diameter of specific pial arterioles, indicating that the effect was not the result of systemic blood pressure oscillations. fMRI data collected from the same subject 4 days prior to surgery demonstrates that ~0.1 Hz oscillations in the BOLD signal can be detected around the same region. Intraoperative optical imaging data from a patient undergoing epilepsy surgery, in whom sinusoidal oscillations were not observed, is shown for comparison. This direct observation of the '0.1 Hz wave' in the awake human brain, using both intraoperative imaging and pre-operative fMRI, confirms that SSHOs occur in the human brain, and can be detected by fMRI. We discuss the possible physiological basis of this oscillation and its potential link to brain pathologies, highlighting its relevance to resting-state fMRI and its potential as a novel target for functional diagnosis and delineation of neurological disease.

Title: High-speed real-time resting-state FMRI using multi-slab echo-volumar imaging.
Abstract: We recently demonstrated that ultra-high-speed real-time fMRI using multi-slab echo-volumar imaging (MEVI) significantly increases sensitivity for mapping task-related activation and resting-state networks (RSNs) compared to echo-planar imaging (Posse et al., 2012). In the present study we characterize the sensitivity of MEVI for mapping RSN connectivity dynamics, comparing independent component analysis (ICA) and a novel seed-based connectivity analysis (SBCA) that combines sliding-window correlation analysis with meta-statistics. This SBCA approach is shown to minimize the effects of confounds, such as movement, and CSF and white matter signal changes, and enables real-time monitoring of RSN dynamics at time scales of tens of seconds. We demonstrate highly sensitive mapping of eloquent cortex in the vicinity of brain tumors and arterio-venous malformations, and detection of abnormal resting-state connectivity in epilepsy. In patients with motor impairment, resting-state fMRI provided focal localization of sensorimotor cortex compared with more diffuse activation in task-based fMRI. The fast acquisition speed of MEVI enabled segregation of cardiac-related signal pulsation using ICA, which revealed distinct regional differences in pulsation amplitude and waveform, elevated signal pulsation in patients with arterio-venous malformations and a trend toward reduced pulsatility in gray matter of patients compared with healthy controls. Mapping cardiac pulsation in cortical gray matter may carry important functional information that distinguishes healthy from diseased tissue vasculature. This novel fMRI methodology is particularly promising for mapping eloquent cortex in patients with neurological disease, having variable degree of cooperation in task-based fMRI. In conclusion, ultra-high-real-time speed fMRI enhances the sensitivity of mapping the dynamics of resting-state connectivity and cerebro-vascular pulsatility for clinical and neuroscience research applications.

Title: [Neuroimaging in epilepsy].
Abstract: It is now recommended that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) be carried out in all patients with at least partial- and hopefully also generalized epilepsy to help identify intracranial lesions, such as hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, brain tumor, cavernous malformation, and arteriovenous malformation. In order to identify epileptic focus, other neuroimaging tools, such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), are also useful, because an epileptogenic area is not necessarily located within these intracranial lesions. With regard to epilepsy surgery, neuroimaging is also required for the identification of functionally essential cortices, such as motor and language areas. MEG and functional MRI are noninvasively, and tractography with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is also useful for visualizing relevant white matter tracts. Recently, it has been reported that the cortico-cortical network plays an important role in preservation of brain function. Thus, cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEP) and resting state fMRI are candidate methods to help clarify brain network. While good seizure control is an important treatment outcome for patients with intractable partial epilepsy, the preservation of brain function is equally important. For this reason, further development and clinical application of sophisticated imaging technique are required.

Title: Resting-state fMRI: a review of methods and clinical applications.
Abstract: Resting-state fMRI measures spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal to investigate the functional architecture of the brain. Application of this technique has allowed the identification of various RSNs, or spatially distinct areas of the brain that demonstrate synchronous BOLD fluctuations at rest. Various methods exist for analyzing resting-state data, including seed-based approaches, independent component analysis, graph methods, clustering algorithms, neural networks, and pattern classifiers. Clinical applications of resting-state fMRI are at an early stage of development. However, its use in presurgical planning for patients with brain tumor and epilepsy demonstrates early promise, and the technique may have a future role in providing diagnostic and prognostic information for neurologic and psychiatric diseases.
